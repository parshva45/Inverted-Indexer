warehouses on the beach of st eustatius were damaged by the hurricane the exact origin of the hurricane is unknown since nobody recorded anything or anticipated anything but it probably developed as do many hurricanes in the east atlantic ocean off the cape verde islands in early october the system strengthened and expanded as it tracked slowly westward and first began affecting barbados late on october 9 late on october 10 the worst of the hurricane passed over the island early on october 11 the hurricane turned north northwest about 90 kilometres east of saint lucia and later that night it neared the island of martinique the cyclone gradually weakened as it passed to the southwest of dominica early on october 12 and subsequently struck the island of guadeloupe 2 after hitting guadeloupe the hurricane turned west northwest passing about 145 kilometres southwest of saint kitts the hurricane steadily neared puerto rico as it paralleled the southern coastline and on october 14 made its closest point of approach to the southwest portion of the island it subsequently turned to the northwest hitting the island of mona in the mona passage before making landfall near the present day dominican republic province of late on october 15 it reached the atlantic ocean and after passing about 260 kilometres east of grand turk island it is estimated to have recurved to the northeast the

and high tides were reported in the british province of east florida the northeastern portion of present day florida one modern historian suggests the hurricane passed much closer to the province than

the hurricane produced violent winds so deafening that people could not hear their own voices the hurricane stripped the bark off trees and left none standing on the island 2 even the strongest hurricanes do not strip the bark off trees and cuban meteorologist carlos estimated that this phenomenon would require rain and winds over 200 miles per hour 9 the winds also destroyed every house on
