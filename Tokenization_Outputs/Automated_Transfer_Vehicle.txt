space centre kourou in french guiana site ela 3 booster ariane 5 es the automated transfer vehicle originally ariane transfer vehicle or atv was an expendable cargo spacecraft developed by the european space agency esa 5 it was operated in conjunction with the ariane 5 heavy lift launch vehicle which conveyed the atv into orbit it functions much like the russian progress cargo spacecraft but with three times the capacity a total of five atvs jules verne johannes kepler edoardo amaldi albert einstein and georges were launched following several delays to the programme the first of these was launched in march 2008 these atvs performed supply missions to the international space station iss transporting various payloads such as propellant water air food and scientific research equipment atvs also reboosted the station into a higher orbit while docked it was an uncrewed platform that operated with a high level of automation such as its docking sequence at no point was it used for transporting passengers on 2 april 2012 the esa announced that the atv program would be terminated following the launch of the fifth atv in 2014 6 further use of the atv has been proposed various further developments including crewed versions of the atv as well as opportunities to reuse sections or elements of its technology have been studied by both the esa and airbus defence and space the principal manufacturer of the vehicle 7 8 9 in 2012 esa member states decided that the atv would be adapted to serve as the service module of the nasa orion spacecraft in january 2013 the esa and nasa announced that they were proceeding with a combined orion and atv derived service module which would serve a major component for the in development orion crewed spacecraft 10 contents 1 development

was collectively recognised by the 15 participating nations that upon completion the international space station iss a crewed space station in low earth orbit leo would require regular resupply missions in order to meet the needs of the onboard crew as well as to deliver apparatus to support the various scientific tests that would be performed on board in october 1995 it was agreed that amongst the various contributions to the iss program that europe would assume responsibility for under the vestiges of the european space agency esa would be the automated transfer vehicle or atv this logistics orientated spacecraft would perform the identified resupply missions to iss 11 12 on 9 december 1998 the esa awarded a $470 million contract to proceed with development work on the atv to french aerospace company 13 while served as the principal contractor for the atv it was joined by multiple major subcontractors including italian manufacturer alenia spazio franco british firm matra marconi space and german aerospace company daimlerchrysler aerospace dasa some components were also provided by russian firm s p korolev rocket and space corporation energia 13 12 prior to 2000 dasa was to serve as the prime contractor for production after which the role would be gradually transferred to at the point at which the contract had been awarded it was envisioned that the first flight of the atv would be conducted during september 2003 13 12 14 the launch of the first atv which had been named jules verne was subject to multiple delays which were partially generated by problems encountered with the ariane 5 heavy lift launch vehicle as well as a substantial software re write 15 16 17 by may 2003 it was set to be launched sometime during late 2004 18 19 by mid 2004 it had been announced that launch of the first atv which was by then undergoing electrical testing following the completion of integration work had been postponed due to technical issues and was reportedly scheduled to be launched during late 2005 following the issuing of a renegotiated $1.1 billion contract between the esa and the prime contractor 14 20 in march 2005 another launch delay was declared due to the need for greater development of the failure mode software along with launch window timing changes which put the planned atv launch back from late 2005 to an undetermined date during 2006 21 22 in october 2005 it was clarified that the new launch date for the first atv would be during 2007 17 in september 2006 it was announced that the final stage of testing on the ariane customised atv stage was within its final phase 23 in december 2006 it was announced that the first atv had completed its vacuum test marking the successful completion of the key tests and enabling a final launch date to be set 24 in april 2007 the atv was subject to four month long qualification process in response to operational concerns including safety queries originating from the u s and to examine the potential commercialisation 25 26 production edit following multiple restructuring and ownership changes 27 18 the prime contractor for the atv became airbus defence and space whom lead a consortium of many sub contractors while development work have been started in les mureaux france much of the activity relocated to bremen germany as the project moved from its development to the production stage in which work on the four initial units started in order to facilitate the relationship between the contractor and the esa an integrated esa team at the les mureaux site was established and maintained for the duration of the development citation needed airbus defence and space builds the atvs in its facility in bremen in 2004 contracts and accords were signed for four additional atvs which were envisioned to be launched at a rate of around one every two years bringing the total order including the first jules verne to five vehicles according to the german aerospace center dlr the development cost of the atv was approximately 28 reportedly each atv spacecraft was costed at roughly which did not include launch costs 29 in march 2005 rsc energia signed a contract with one of the main subcontractors of airbus defence and space the italian company alenia spazio now thales alenia space to supply the russian docking system refuelling system and russian equipment control system 30 within the airbus defence and space led project thales alenia space is responsible for the pressurized cargo carrier section of the atv and manufactures these at the facility in turin italy citation needed on 31 july 2007 the first atv jules verne arrived at the esa spaceport in kourou french guiana after a nearly two week journey from rotterdam harbour 31 on 9 march 2008 jules verne was launched on top of an ariane 5 rocket from kourou 32 33 on 3 april 2008 jules verne succeeded in automatically docking with the iss proving the capabilities of the first fully automated expendable cargo resupply spacecraft 34 35 the arrival of the atv came at a time at which there were public concerns over the logistical practicality of supplying the iss 36 in addition to its use by esa and russia the atv was at one point under consider to perform services for nasa as part of the commercial orbital transportation services program to replace the retiring space shuttle in its orbital cargo carrying capacity 26 under the proposal which had been issued by a joint venture between eads and boeing the atv would be launched from cape canaveral florida using a delta iv rocket 37 38 one speculated use for atv was to achieve the de orbiting of the iss once the space station had reached the end of its service life being the only vehicle capable of doing so at that time after the retirement 39 ultimately the proposal was not awarded with a corresponding contract design edit the automated transfer vehicle atv was an expendable cargo spacecraft each vehicle consisted of two distinct sections the systems bus and the integrated cargo carrier 12 the system bus contained the propulsion system avionics bays and solar arrays it was principally used following the detachment from the ariane 5 launcher to automatically traverse the remaining distance and dock with the iss the system bus would be inaccessible to the astronauts on board 12 the integrated cargo carrier consisted of a pressurised module external bays for fluid and gas cargoes further avionics and rendezvous sensors and the docking mechanism the primary structure of the atv is protected by a meteorite and debris protection system 12 the docking system of the atv consists of a pair of videometers and a pair of telegoniometers manufactured by sodern a subsidiary of airbus 40 data processing for the rendezvous docking maneuver and emergency abort systems were designed and manufactured by crisa additional monitoring data and redundancy was provided by the kurs 41 42 automatic docking system which was also used by soyuz and progress spacecraft visual imagery is provided by a camera on the zvezda iss module in terms of its role the atv was designed to complement the smaller russian progress spacecraft possessing three times its useful payload capacity similar to the progress it would carry both bulk liquids and relatively fragile freight which would be stored within a cargo hold maintained at a pressurized shirt sleeve environment in order that astronauts would be able to access payloads without the need to put on spacesuits the pressurized cargo section of the atv was based on the italian built multi purpose logistics module mplm which was a shuttle carried space barge that had been previously used for transporting equipment to and from the station unlike the mplm the atv used the same docking mechanism as employed upon the progress 12 the atv like the progress also serves as a container for the waste each atv weighs 20.7 tonnes at launch and has a cargo capacity of 8 tonnes 3 1,500 kilograms to 5,500 kilograms of dry cargo re supply goods scientific payload etc up to 840 kilograms of water up to 100 kilograms of gas nitrogen oxygen air with up to two gases per flight up to 4,700 kilograms of propellant for the re boost maneuver and refueling the station the atv propellant used for re boost monomethylhydrazine fuel and n 2 o 4 oxidizer is of a different type from the payload refueling propellant udmh fuel and n 2 o 4 oxidizer use edit jules verne seen at the bottom of the iss making the relative size clearly visible atvs were intended to be routinely launched every 17 months to conduct resupply missions to the international space station 43 the vehicle was launched into an orbital plane compatible with the iss via the ariane 5 expendable launch system shortly after detaching from the launcher the atv would deploy its solar panels 12 over an average mission time of 100 hours it would perform phasing manoeuvers from its initial orbital high point under direct control from the ground based european space operations centre at darmstadt germany using tracking and data relay satellite system a second series of manoeuvres would bring the atv to the precise altitude of the iss before commencing integrated operations for the final approach with the space station during which mission authority transferred to christopher c kraft jr mission control center in houston texas 12 the atv would employ a combination of gps and astronavigation techniques to automatically rendezvous with the space station 12 telemetry contact was established between the iss and atv during its preparations for the final approach once at a distance of 249 m the onboard computers of the atv employed both videometer and telegoniometer data to perform the final approach and docking manoeuvres the docking itself to the zvezda module was fully automated in the event of are any last minute technical issues or problems a pre programmed sequence of anti collision manoeuvres fully independent of the main navigation system can be activated by the flight engineers aboard the station upon contact with the module the automatic capture sequence would be activated 12 once the atv had successfully docked the station crew would be able to enter the cargo section and directly access the payload on board 12 the liquid tanks would be connected to the plumbing by the crew to discharge their contents in a controlled manner while the station crew would manually release air components directly into the atmosphere for up to six months the atv which would remain mainly in dormant mode could remain attached to the iss with the hatch remaining open throughout 12 the crew would then steadily fill the cargo section with the waste material for disposal at intervals of 10 to 45 days the atv would be reactivated and its thrusters would typically be used to boost the altitude 12 once its mission was accomplished the atv which would often be filled with up to 6.5 tonnes of waste would separate from the iss its thrusters would deliberately move the spacecraft out of orbit de orbit and place it on a steep flight path to perform a controlled destructive re entry high above the pacific ocean 14 johannes kepler automated transfer launch as seen from the iss jules verne automated transfer vehicle approaches the international space station

iss 2008 the first flight of the atv was delayed on multiple occasions prior to its launch on 9 march 2008 it was named jules verne in memory of the first science fiction writer of modern times the jules verne carried two of the original handwritten manuscripts to be received by the iss crew as symbolic tokens of the success of the first flight 58 the craft was launched into a 300 kilometre orbit atop an ariane 5 rocket from the equatorial ela 3 launch site at the guiana space centre the atv separated from the rocket and following weeks of tests and orbit adjustments successfully docked in the international space station at 14 45 utc on 3 april 2008 in the early morning hours of 29 september 2008 the jules verne burnt up on entering the atmosphere above an uninhabited section of the

heaviest spacecraft ever launched by an ariane rocket 69 atv control centre edit atv missions were monitored and controlled from the atv control centre atv cc located at the toulouse space centre cst in toulouse france the atv cc was responsible for the planning and the issuing of commands for the orbital maneuvers and mission tasks of each atv from the moment of separation from its launch vehicle until it burns up in the atmosphere the atv cc has a direct communication line with the columbus control center col cc in oberpfaffenhofen germany col cc provides atv cc with access to both the tracking and data relay satellite system and the european artemis communication networks in order to communicate with both the atv and the iss the atv cc coordinated its actions with christopher c kraft jr mission control center mcc h in houston and the russian fka mission control center tsup or mcc m in moscow as well as the atv launch site at the guiana space centre in kourou french guiana 70 orion service module edit main article orion service module orion spacecraft including the atv derived service module in may 2011 the esa director general announced a possible collaboration with nasa to work on a successor to the atv 71 later that year a proposal to utilise an atv derived service module for orion capsule was revealed 72 this service module would be provided as barter for the 8% share of the operating expense of the iss which had been fulfilled up to 2017 by the five atvs developing a service module for orion would cover the share of iss operation up to 2020 73 contribution is going to be critical to the success of 2017 mission orion program manager 10 in june 2012 the esa awarded two separate studies to airbus each worth million to evaluate options for using technology and experience gained from atv and columbus related work to cover the share of iss operation past 2017 74 one study looked into developing a service module for orion while the other examined development of a multipurpose vehicle that could resupply space stations remove debris and service satellites in orbit the studies were to be completed before the end of 2012 75 at the meeting of the esa ministerial council in november 2012 the esa committed to developing the service module 76 and in mid december signed an agreement with nasa to provide an atv derived orion service module for the first launch of orion on the space launch system 10 the esa awarded airbus defence and space a million 488 million contract in november 2014 to develop and build the module 77 evolution proposals edit in addition to its principal role as a one way uncrewed cargo transfer vehicle from the onset of work on the project the esa had viewed the atv as having the potential for being the starting point for a whole family of automated space vehicles 12 amongst the conceived missions for atv derived vehicles have been orbital automated construction programmes and independent bases for experiments as well as a potential upgraded version of the atv that would survive reentry intact enabling its use as a two way cargo transfer vehicle 12 14 the potential commercialisation of the atv was also the subject of a formal study conducted by the esa during which the prospects of using the spacecraft as a dedicated tug for reorbiting satellites as well as the use of alternative launch systems were examined 78 following the decision by nasa to retire the space shuttle in 2011 the esa decided to launch a further series of studies to determine the potential for evolutions and adaptations of the atv as a result of these studies the cargo return version carv was identified as a particularly promising candidate for further development the goal of this variant is to provide esa with the capability to transport scientific data and cargo from the iss to earth beyond this carv could be enhanced to become a crew vehicle which would be launched by an adapted ariane 5 mini space station the mss concept is an atv evolution proposal for the construction of multiple atvs with two docking ports one at each end the current version of the atv is already prepared for a docking port at the back with the main propulsion system arranged in a cylindrical fashion leaving room for a tunnel through the middle this concept would allow soyuz progress and other atvs to dock to the back of the atv allowing a steady flow of russian vehicles using the available docking ports whilst an atv is docked for an average of around 6 months at a time 79 payload retrieval system the pares would have included a small ballistic capsule similar to vbk raduga embedded into the atv docking interface which would have brought back a few tens of kilograms of payload pares could have featured a deployable heat shield system the european space agency was also proposing the system for use with the progress spacecraft and the h ii transfer vehicle htv 79 80 cargo ascent and return vehicle the carv would deliver a redesigned capsule capable of bringing back payload from orbit it could be installed in place of the atv pressurized cargo hold in addition it could be adapted to dock at the us side of the station given the larger docking ports there it would be possible to transfer complete international standard payload racks isprs from the atv to the station which is not currently possible 79 crew transport vehicle this is another option under consideration similar to the carv variant this would replace the current integrated cargo carrier with a pressurized re entry capsule a significant difference with the cargo only variant would be the presence of a crew escape system consisting of a number of booster rockets able to pull the crew capsule away from the launcher ariane 5 and or service module in the event of an emergency the ctv variant of the atv could be able to seat 4 or 5 crew members 79 possibilities for launching of the atv on other launchers than the ariane 5 have also been investigated in particular in the frame of commercial orbital transportation services esa and its member states will consider approval for further atv development in the coming years 79 an mss could be used as a small orbital lab pares capsules would be able to hold a few kg of cargo carv would be used to transport a large amount of cargo to earth proposed crewed version edit a 3d rendering of the proposed atv derived crewed transportation system both the esa and the manufacturing team have considered various programmes under which the atv or portions of the technologies composing it would have been developed into a crewed configuration 81 on 14 may 2008 aerospace company eads astrium and the german aerospace center dlr announced that they were actively pursuing a development project with the aim of adapting the atv into a crew transportation system 82 in the envisioned configuration the craft would be able to launch a 3 person crew beyond leo via use of a modified version of the ariane 5 rocket and would be more spacious than the russian soyuz a mock up of the proposed craft was publicly displayed at the 2008 international aerospace exhibition in berlin 83 if the project were to have been given esa approval development would have proceeded in two stages 84 the first stage would have involved the development of an advanced reentry vehicle arv 85 capable of transporting up to of cargo from space to earth safely see carv above by 2015 86 this capability would be available to esa even if further development were to be halted it would prove useful in the iss program as well as the proposed mars sample return mission with nasa arv development would make use of work done on the atmospheric reentry demonstrator crew return vehicle and related projects the budget for this stage of the atv overhaul would reportedly be 87 88 89 the second stage would adapt the then existing capsule to be able to transport people safely as well as upgrade the propulsion and other systems in the service module and would last 4 to 5 years at a cost of a couple of billion euro according to a senior astrium representative 83 90 91 in november 2008 esa ministers budgeted for a feasibility study into developing a re entry capsule for the atv a requirement for developing either a cargo return capacity or a crew version of the atv 92 on 7 july 2009 the esa signed a study contract with eads astrium 93 94 the arv effort was ultimately discontinued after completing the b1 stage due to fiscal constraints resulting from the late 2000s financial crisis 95 exoliner edit during the 2010s lockheed martin put together a proposal for commercial resupply services 2 that included a new 4 4 meter diameter cargo transport module called exoliner which was based on the atv and
