it has met some criterion or achieved some statistic or is part of a top ten for some superlative it includes lists and rankings of pacific hurricanes by different characteristics and impacts characteristics include extremes of location such as the northernmost or most equator ward formation or position of a tropical cyclone other characteristics include its central pressure windspeed category on the scale cyclogenesis outside of a normal hurricane timeframe or storms that remain unnamed despite forming after tropical cyclone naming began in 1960 another characteristic is how long a system went from formation to dissipation these include the cost of damage the number of casualties as well as meteorological statistics such as rainfall point maxima hurricane pauline contents 1

edit hurricane oho the eighth system to receive a central pacific name in 2015 naming of tropical cyclones in the eastern north pacific began in the 1960 season that year four lists of names were created the plan was to proceed in a manner similar to that of the western pacific that is the name of the first storm in one season would be the next unused one from the same list and when the bottom of one list was reached the next list was started this scheme was abandoned in 1965 and next year the lists started being recycled on a four year rotation starting with the a name each year 33 that same general scheme remains in use today although the names and lists are different on average the eastern north pacific sees about sixteen named storms per year 34 named storms per month edit four of

spent some time in the west pacific before dissipating john spent eleven days west of the dateline if that time was included john would have existed for a total of and a world record while including time in the west pacific would mean that it existed for 18 days 35 one atlantic hurricane hurricane joan crossed into this basin and was renamed miriam 45 giving it a total lifespan of 46 but not all of that was in the pacific greg formed from the remnants of tropical storm bret 45 its time as an atlantic system is excluded all of these systems except trudy olaf and connie existed in both the east and central pacific and all except olaf were hurricanes hurricane trudy of 1990 is thus the longest lived eastern pacific hurricane to stay in the eastern pacific tropical storm olaf of 1997 is hence the longest lived eastern pacific tropical cyclone not to reach hurricane intensity 35 no known tropical cyclone forming in the central north pacific lasted for longer than without crossing into

official western pacific tropical cyclone 72 73 74 from western pacific to central pacific edit hurricane john crossed the dateline twice from the central to the western pacific and back tropical

ulika 2016 84 system crossed more than once it was previously believed that an unnamed hurricane of 1975 crossed and is still included in the nhc as such but according to a reanalysis made by the cphc the storm became extratropical before doing so 35 73 in addition an unofficial cyclone formed on october 30 2006 in the central pacific subtropics it eventually developed an eye like structure 85 its track data indicates that it crossed from the central to the east pacific because it formed at longitude and dissipated at 86 nasa which is not a meteorological organization called this system a subtropical cyclone and the naval research laboratory monterey had enough interest in it to call it 91c 85 the system has also been called extratropical 87 this cyclone is unofficial because it is not included in the seasonal reports of either regional specialized meteorological center 88 89 intensity records edit ten most intense edit hurricane patricia the most intense pacific hurricane on record
