play media sts 134 space shuttle launch the space shuttle had been scheduled to be retired from service after sts 133 but controversy over the cancellation of several international space station components most notably the alpha magnetic spectrometer in order to meet deadlines for the retirement of the shuttle caused the united states government to consider ordering an additional mission 21 on 19 june 2008 the united states house of representatives passed the nasa authorization act of 2008 giving nasa funding for one additional mission to deliver science experiments to the station 21 the same mandate was included in the u s senate version of the nasa authorization act that was unanimously approved by the senate committee on commerce science and transportation on 25 june 2008 22 it was amended and passed by the full senate on 25 september 2008 passed by the house on 27 september 2008 and signed by president george w bush on 15 october 2008 23 24 bush had previously opposed any additional shuttle missions as they could delay the transition to project constellation 25 in the spring of 2009 the obama administration included funds for the sts 134 mission in its proposed 2010 nasa budget 26 sts 134 was planned to be the final regularly scheduled mission of the nasa space shuttle program but with the passing in 2011 of an appropriations bill authorizing the conversion of sts 335 to sts 135 this was no longer the case 27 it was also originally scheduled to coincide with expedition 26 before delays in the space shuttle launch schedule pushed it past that expedition if sts 134 had launched during expedition 26 then mark kelly and expedition 26 commander scott kelly would have become the first siblings and twins to fly in space at the same time 28 shuttle commander mark wife u s representative gabrielle giffords flew to the kennedy space center ksc in florida to view the first launch attempt her first trip since moving from tucson to houston for rehabilitation after being seriously wounded in the january 2011 tucson shooting on 16 may giffords was again at ksc for the launch which was one of the most anticipated in years according to the new york times u s president barack obama scheduled a visit to kennedy space center on 29 april 2011 to view the launch 29 and despite the canceled launch attempt he toured an orbiter processing facility at launch complex 39 and met with giffords and the six crewmembers 30 mission payload edit a close up view of ams 2 inside endeavour s payload bay shortly before it was installed on the iss alpha magnetic spectrometer 2 edit main article alpha magnetic spectrometer the alpha magnetic spectrometer 2 ams 02 was carried to the iss in endeavour s payload bay and was attached to the s3 truss segment the ams 02 unit is a particle physics detector which contains a large permanent magnet and is designed to search for antimatter and investigate the origin and structure of dark matter 2 according to the original design plan a cryogenic superconducting magnet system was developed for the ams 02 this was reported by nasa to be a critical technology granting the instrument the high sensitivity needed to achieve mission objectives 31 late in its development however poorly understood anomalous heating in the cryogenic magnet system was discovered as a result the ams 02 experiment leader samuel c c ting decided to replace the superconducting magnet inside the spectrometer with the permanent magnet previously used in ams 01 32 33 express logistics carrier 3 edit elc 3 in its launch configuration the express logistics carrier 3 elc3 carried several orbital replacement units oru that were too large or too heavy for other spacecraft to carry to the iss these orus included a high pressure gas tank hpgt an ammonia tank assembly ata the s band antenna sub system assembly 2 3 sasa a special purpose dextrous manipulator spdm arm with orbital replacement unit change out mechanism a space test

nav risk mitigation detailed test objective kit edit the orion rel nav sensor was mounted on the orbiter docking system ods in trajectory control sensor slot 1 and on an adaptive payload carrier in the bay 3 port of the payload bay for the storrm detailed test objective dto after endeavour undocked it completed its normal fly around of the station the crew then guided endeavour back towards the station flying a nominal orbiter trajectory for docking to the pressurized mating adapter 2 however the shuttle did not actually dock with the iss again instead it was positioned below the station on sts 131 the docking target on the iss was enhanced with reflectors to allow for the characterization of the orion rel nav sensors performance during rendezvous and proximity operations with the iss these proximity operations were tested during approach and docking undocking flyaround time permitting and during a modified separation from the iss during the modified separation the crew performed a series of re rendezvous burns that put the orbiter on an orion like rendezvous profile afterwards instead of re docking to the iss the crew performed a full separation 2 glacier freezer module edit sts 134 carried a new glacier module to the iss and returned two old ones to earth the glacier units were used to store and return science samples on the space shuttle 2 orbiter boom sensor system edit the newly attached obss at the space station sts 134 left its orbiter boom sensor system obss permanently on the iss for use in reaching places that the canadarm2 cannot get to on its own 2 the usefulness of having an obss available for use at the station was demonstrated during scott parazynski s repair of the torn p6 solar panel on sts 120 the feasibility of leaving an obss attached to iss for a long period of time was demonstrated when the sts 123 mission left one behind for use during the subsequent sts 124 mission lego kits edit endeavour brought 13 lego kits to the iss where astronauts built lego models to see how they would react in microgravity as part of the lego bricks in space program the results were shared with schools as part of an educational project 34 35 shuttle life edit the life precursor mission was launched aboard endeavour this planetary society project was to test the mission destined for fobos grunt the stage rehearsal was deemed fully successful 36 37 stem bars edit endeavour brought specialized nutrition bars called stem bars to the iss these were created by high school students and sisters mikayla and shannon diesch the nutrition bars were certified for spaceflight by meeting a specific nasa developed nutritional profile and had to pass strict microbial testing the stem bars were flown to support the work of the battle creek michigan based sisters to raise awareness of the importance of stem education among their peers an outreach effort which they started after they won the 2010 conrad foundation spirit of innovation awards 38 the little mole edit a figurine of the little mole was successfully brought back to earth by andrew feustel it was later presented to the creator miler and used for space science popularization mainly in the czech republic 39 mission experiments edit endeavour performed four department of defense payloads of opportunity maui seiti rambo 2 and simplex all four of these experiments required engine and thruster firings and were to be completed only if there was sufficient propellant on board endeavour mission milestones edit the mission marked 165th nasa manned space
