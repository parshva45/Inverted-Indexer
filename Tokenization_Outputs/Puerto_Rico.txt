indigenous cultures in the new world aztec maya and inca which left behind abundant archeological and physical evidence of their societies scant artifacts and evidence remain of the puerto indigenous population scarce archaeological findings and early spanish accounts from the colonial era constitute all that is known about them the first comprehensive book on the history of puerto rico was written by fray abbad y lasierra in 1786 nearly three centuries after the first spaniards landed on the island 40 the first known settlers were the ortoiroid people an archaic period culture of amerindian hunters and fishermen who migrated from the south american mainland some scholars suggest their settlement dates back about 4,000 years 41 an archeological dig in 1990 on the island of vieques found the remains of a man designated as the puerto ferro man which was dated to around 2000 bc 42 the ortoiroid were displaced by the saladoid a culture from the same region that arrived on the island between 430 and 250 bc 41 the igneri tribe migrated to puerto rico between 120 and from the region of the orinoco river in northern south america the arcaico and igneri co existed on the

for the expansion of the spanish empire and the christian faith juan ponce de a lieutenant under columbus founded the first spanish settlement caparra on august 8 1508 he later served as the first governor of the island f eventually traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as puerto rico and san juan became the name of the main trading shipping port at the beginning of the 16th century the spanish people began to colonize the island despite the laws of burgos of 1512 and other decrees for the protection of the indigenous population some indians were forced into an encomienda system of forced labor in the early years of colonization the population suffered extremely high fatalities from epidemics of european infectious diseases g h i j k colonization the habsburgs in 1520 king charles i of spain issued a royal decree collectively emancipating the remaining population by that time the people were few in number 54 enslaved africans had already begun to compensate for the native labor loss but their numbers were proportionate to the diminished commercial interest spain soon began to demonstrate for the island colony other nearby islands like cuba saint domingue and guadeloupe attracted more of the slave trade than puerto rico probably because of greater agricultural interests in those islands on which colonists had developed large sugar plantations and had the capital to invest in the atlantic slave trade 55 from the beginning of the country the colonial administration relied heavily on the industry of enslaved africans and creole blacks for public works and defenses primarily in coastal ports and cities where the tiny colonial population had hunkered down with no significant industries or large scale agricultural production as yet enslaved and free communities lodged around the few littoral settlements particularly around san juan also forming lasting afro creole communities meanwhile in the interior there developed a mixed and independent peasantry that relied on a subsistence economy this mostly unsupervised population supplied villages and settlements with foodstuffs and in relative isolation set the pattern for what later would be known as the puerto rican culture by the end of the 16th century the spanish empire was diminishing and in the face of increasing raids from european competitors the colonial administration throughout the americas fell into a bunker mentality imperial strategists and urban planners redesigned port settlements into military posts with the objective of protecting spanish territorial claims and ensuring the safe passing of the silver laden atlantic fleet to the iberian peninsula san juan served as an important port of call for ships driven across the atlantic by its powerful trade winds west indies convoys linked spain to the island sailing between and the spanish west indies the seat of government was on the forested islet of san juan and for a time became one of the most heavily fortified settlements in the spanish caribbean earning the name of the walled city the islet is still dotted with the various forts and walls such as la fortaleza castillo san felipe del morro and castillo san designed to protect the population and the strategic port of san juan from the raids of the spanish european competitors hendricksz 1625 attack on san juan puerto rico in 1625 in the battle of san juan the dutch commander boudewijn hendricksz tested the defenses limits like no one else before learning from francis drake s previous failures here he circumvented the cannons of the castle of san felipe del morro and quickly brought his 17 ships into the san juan bay he then occupied the port and attacked the city while the population hurried for shelter behind the moat and high battlements historians consider this event the worst attack on san juan though the dutch set the village on fire they failed to conquer the morro and its batteries pounded their troops and ships until hendricksz deemed the cause lost expedition eventually helped propel a fortification frenzy constructions of defenses for the san hill were soon ordered so as to prevent the landing of invaders out of reach of the artillery urban planning responded to the needs of keeping the colony in spanish hands late colonial period hacienda la fortuna a sugar mill complex in puerto rico painted by francisco oller in 1885 brooklyn museum during the late 16th and early 17th centuries spain concentrated its colonial efforts on the more prosperous mainland north central and south american colonies with the advent of the lively bourbon dynasty in spain in the 1700s the island of puerto rico began a gradual shift to more imperial attention more roads began connecting previously isolated inland settlements to coastal cities and coastal settlements like arecibo mayaguez and ponce began acquiring importance of their own separate from san juan by the end of the 18th century merchant ships from an array of nationalities threatened the tight regulations of the mercantilist system which turned each colony solely toward the european metropole and limited contact with other nations u s ships came to surpass spanish trade and with this also came the exploitation of the natural resources slavers which had made but few stops on the island before began selling more enslaved africans to growing sugar and coffee plantations the increasing number of atlantic wars in which the caribbean islands played major roles like the war of jenkins ear the seven years war and the atlantic revolutions ensured puerto growing esteem in eyes on april 17 1797 sir ralph abercromby fleet invaded the island with a force of men 56 which included german soldiers and royal marines

cuba among the influential members of this movement were brigadier general antonio valero de and de las mercedes barbudo the movement was discovered and governor miguel de la torre had its members imprisoned or exiled 58 with the increasingly rapid growth of independent former spanish colonies in the south and central american states in the first part of the 19th century the spanish crown considered puerto rico and cuba of strategic importance to increase its hold on its last two new world colonies the spanish crown revived the royal decree of graces of 1815 as a result of which 450,000 immigrants mainly spaniards settled on the island in the period up until the american conquest printed in three english and was intended to also attract non spanish europeans with the hope that the independence movements would lose their popularity if new settlers had stronger ties to the crown hundreds of non spanish families mainly from corsica france germany ireland italy and scotland also immigrated to the island 59 free land was offered as an incentive to those who wanted to populate the two islands on the condition that they swear their loyalty to the spanish crown and

which asked whether to remain in the current status and no had won the trump administration cited changes in demographics during the past 5 years to add the option once again amendments to the plebiscite bill were adopted making ballot wording changes requested by the department of justice as well as adding a current territorial status option 101 while 97 percent voted in favor of statehood the turnout was low only some 23 percent voted 102 after the ballots were counted the justice department was non committal the justice department had asked for the 2017 plebiscite to be postponed but the government chose not to do so after the outcome was announced the department told the associated press that it had not reviewed or approved the language 103 former governor acevedo is convinced that statehood is not the solution for either the u s or for puerto rico for economic identity and cultural reasons he pointed out that voter turnout for the 2017 referendum was extremely low and suggests that a different type of mutually beneficial relationship should be found 104 if the federal government agrees to discuss an association agreement the conditions would be negotiated between the two entities 105 the agreement might cover topics such as the role of the u s military in puerto rico the use of the u s currency free trade between the two entities and whether puerto ricans would be u s citizens 106 the three current free associated states marshall islands micronesia and palau use the american dollar receive some financial support and the promise of military defense if they refuse military access to any other country their citizens are allowed to work in the u s and serve in its military 105 governor ricardo is strongly in favor of statehood to help develop the economy and help to solve our 500 year old colonial dilemma colonialism is not an option a civil rights issue 3.5 million citizens seeking an absolute democracy he told the news media 107 benefits of statehood include an additional $10 billion per year in federal funds the right to vote in presidential elections higher social security and medicare benefits and a right for its government agencies and municipalities to file for bankruptcy the latter is currently prohibited 108 statehood might be useful as a means of dealing with the financial crisis since it would allow for bankruptcy and the relevant protection according to the government development bank this might be the only solution to the debt crisis congress has the power to vote to allow chapter 9 protection without the need for statehood but in late 2015 there was very little support in the house for this concept other benefits to statehood include increased disability benefits and medicaid funding the right to vote in presidential elections and the higher federal minimum wage 109 subsequent to the 2017 referendum puerto legislators are also expected to vote on a bill that would allow the governor to draft a state constitution and hold elections to choose senators and representatives to the federal congress 110 111 in spite of the outcome of the referendum and the so called tennessee plan above action by the united states congress would be necessary to implement changes to the status of puerto rico under the territorial clause of the united states constitution 108 united nations special committee on decolonization since 1953 the un has been considering the political status of puerto rico and how to assist it in achieving independence or decolonization in 1978 the special committee determined that a colonial relationship existed between the u s and puerto rico 112 the special committee on decolonization has often referred to puerto rico as a nation in its reports because internationally the people of puerto rico are often considered to be a caribbean nation with their own national identity 113 114 115 most recently in a june 2016 report the special committee called for the united states to expedite the process to allow self determination in puerto rico more specifically the group called on the united states to expedite a process that would allow the people of puerto rico to exercise fully their right to self determination and independence allow the puerto rican people to take decisions in a sovereign manner and to address their urgent economic and social needs including unemployment marginalization insolvency and poverty 116 international status on november 27 1953 shortly after the establishment of the commonwealth the general assembly of the united nations approved resolution 748 removing puerto classification as a non self governing territory the general assembly did not apply the full list of criteria which was enunciated in 1960 when it took favorable note of the cessation of transmission of information regarding the non self governing status of puerto rico 117 118 according to the white house task force on puerto political status in its december 21 2007 report the u s in its written submission to the un in 1953 never represented that congress could not change its relationship with puerto rico without the consent 119 it stated that the u s justice department in 1959 reiterated that congress held power over puerto rico pursuant to the territorial clause 120 of the u s constitution 119 in 1993 the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit stated that congress may unilaterally repeal the puerto rican constitution or the puerto rican federal relations act and replace them with any rules or regulations of its choice 121 in a 1996 report on a puerto rico status political bill the u s house committee on resources stated puerto current status does not meet the criteria for any of the options for full self government under resolution 1541 the three established forms of full self government being stated in the report as 1 national independence 2 free association based on separate sovereignty or 3 full integration with another nation on the basis of equality the report concluded that puerto rico remains an unincorporated colony and does not have the status of free association with the united states as that status is defined under united states law or international practice that the establishment of local self government with the consent of the people can be unilaterally revoked by the u s congress and that u s congress can also withdraw the u s citizenship of puerto rican residents of puerto rico at any time for a legitimate federal purpose 122 123 the application of the u s constitution to puerto rico is limited by the insular cases in 2006 124 2007 125 2009 126 2010 127 and 2011 128 the united nations special committee on decolonization passed resolutions calling on the united states to expedite a process that would allow puerto ricans to fully exercise their inalienable right to self determination and independence 129 and to release all puerto rican political prisoners in u s prisons to clean up decontaminate and return the lands in the islands of vieques and culebra to the people of puerto rico to perform a probe into u s human rights violations on the island and a probe into the killing

were 515,348 blank and invalidated ballots counted alongside the 1,363,854 ballots which indicated a choice for one of the non territorial alternatives under puerto rico law these ballots are not considered cast votes and are therefore not reflected in the final tally 130 on july 15 2009 the united nations special committee on decolonization approved a draft resolution calling on the government of the united states to expedite a process that would allow the puerto rican people to exercise fully their inalienable right to self determination and independence 131 on april 29 2010 the u s house voted to approve a measure for a federally sanctioned process for puerto self determination allowing puerto rico to set a new referendum on whether to continue its present form of commonwealth or to have a different political status if puerto ricans voted to continue as a commonwealth the government of puerto rico was authorized to conduct additional plebiscites at intervals of every eight years from the date on which the results of the prior plebiscite were certified if puerto ricans voted to have a different political status a second referendum would determine whether puerto rico would become a u s state an independent country or a sovereign nation associated with the u s that would not be subject to the territorial clause of the united states constitution 132 during the house debate a fourth option to retain its present form of commonwealth sometimes referred to as the status quo political status was added as an option in the second plebiscite 132 133 immediately following u s house passage h r 2499 was sent to the u s senate where it was given two formal readings and referred to the senate committee on energy and natural resources on december 22 2010 the 111th united states congress adjourned without any senate vote on h r 2499 killing the bill 134 the latest task force report was released on march 11 2011 the report suggested a two plebiscite process including a first plebiscite that requires the people of puerto rico to choose whether they wish to be part of the united states either via statehood or commonwealth or wish to be independent via independence or free association if continuing to be part of the united states were chosen in the first plebiscite a second vote would be taken between statehood and commonwealth 135 on june 14 2011 president barack obama promised to support a clear decision by the people of puerto rico on statehood 136 that same month the united nations special committee on decolonization passed a resolution and adopted a consensus text introduced by delegate on june 20 2011 calling on the united states to expedite a process that would allow puerto ricans to fully exercise their inalienable right to self determination and independence 129 on november 6 2012 a two question referendum took place simultaneous with the general elections 137 137 138 the first question asked voters whether they wanted to maintain the current status under the territorial clause of the u s constitution the second question posed three alternate status options if the first question was approved statehood independence or free association 139 for the first question 54 percent voted against the current commonwealth status for the second question 61.16% voted for statehood 33.34% for a sovereign free associated state and 5.49% for independence 140 there were also 515,348 blank and invalidated ballots which are not reflected in the final tally as they are not considered cast votes under puerto rico law 130 on december 11 2012 puerto legislature passed a concurrent resolution to request to the president and the u s congress action on november 6 2012 plebiscite results 141 but on april 10 2013 with the issue still being widely debated the white house announced that it will seek $2.5 million to hold another referendum this next one being the first puerto rican status referendum to be financed by the u s federal government 142 in december 2015 the u s government submitted a brief as amicus curiae to the u s supreme court related to the case commonwealth of puerto rico v sanchez valle the u s government official position is that the u s constitution does not contemplate sovereign territories that the court has consistently recognized that there is no sovereignty in a territory of the united states but that of the united states itself and a u s territory has no independent sovereignty comparable to that of a state that is because the government of a territory owes its existence wholly to the united states plenary authority over federal territories includes the authority to permit self government whereby local officials administer a internal affairs 143 on june 9 2016 in commonwealth of puerto rico vs sanchez valle an majority of the supreme court of the united states determined that puerto rico is a territory and lacks sovereignty 144 on june 30 2016 the president of the united states of america signed a new law approved by u s congress h r 5278 promesa establishing a control board over the puerto rico government this board will have a significant degree of federal control involved in its establishment and operations in particular the authority to establish the control board derives from the federal constitutional power to make all needful rules and regulations regarding u s territories the president would appoint all seven voting members of the board and the board would have broad sovereign powers to effectively overrule decisions by puerto legislature governor and other public authorities 145 political status the latest referendum on statehood independence or an associated republic was held on november 6 2012 the people of puerto rico made history by requesting for the first time ever the conclusion of the current territorial status almost 78% of registered voters participated in a plebiscite held to resolve puerto status and a slim but clear majority 54 disagreed with puerto rico maintaining its present territorial status furthermore among the possible alternatives sixty one percent 61 of voters chose the statehood option while one third of the ballots were submitted blank 146 147 on december 11 2012 the legislative assembly of puerto rico enacted a concurrent resolution requesting the president and the congress of the united states to respond to the referendum of the people of puerto rico held on november 6 2012 to end its current form of territorial status and to begin the process to admit puerto rico as a state

and numerous spanish loyalists from former colonies in south america settlers from outside spain also arrived in the islands including from corsica france lebanon china portugal ireland scotland germany and italy this immigration from non hispanic countries was the result of the real cedula de gracias de 1815 royal decree of graces of 1815 which allowed european catholics to settle in the

contemporary puerto rican history starting soon after world poverty cheap airfares and promotion by the island government caused waves of puerto ricans to move to the united states particularly to the northeastern states and florida 199 this trend continued even as puerto economy improved and its birth rate declined puerto ricans continue to follow a pattern of circular migration with some migrants returning to the island in recent years the population has declined markedly falling nearly 1% in 2012 and an additional 1% 36,000 people in 2013 due to a falling birthrate and emigration 200 according to the 2010 census the number of puerto ricans living in the united states outside of puerto rico far exceeds those living in puerto rico emigration exceeds immigration as those who leave

which would give a protestant percentage of 46% if the last two populations are combined protestants collectively added up to almost two million people another researcher gave a more conservative assessment of the proportion of protestants puerto rico by virtue of its long political association with the united states is the most protestant of latin american countries with a protestant

political parties and elections main article political party strength in puerto rico the difference between the incumbent party the ppd and its opponent the pnp was a mere 0.6% in the last election this difference is common as the political landscape experiences political cycles between both parties with the ppd ruling all branches of government for 36 of the past 64 years the pnp on the other hand has ruled both the executive and legislative branch concurrently for 16 years the other 12 years experienced a divided government since 1952 puerto rico has had three main political parties the popular democratic party ppd in spanish the new progressive party pnp in spanish and the puerto rican independence party pip the three parties stand for different political status the ppd for example seeks to maintain the status with the u s as a commonwealth while the pnp on the other hand seeks to make puerto rico a state of the united states the pip in contrast seeks a complete separation from the united states by seeking to make puerto rico a sovereign nation in terms of party strength the ppd and pnp usually hold about 47% of the vote each while the pip holds only about 5 after 2007 other parties emerged on the island the first the puerto ricans for puerto rico party ppr in spanish was registered that same year the party claims that it seeks to address the islands problems from a

emergence of the movimiento soberanista mus english sovereign union movement and the partido del pueblo trabajador ppt english working party but none obtained more than 1% of the vote other non registered parties include the puerto rican nationalist party the socialist workers movement and the hostosian national independence movement law main articles constitution of puerto rico and law of puerto rico the insular legal system is a blend of civil law and the common law systems puerto rico is the only current u s possession whose legal system operates primarily in a language other than american english namely spanish because the u s federal government operates primarily in english all puerto rican attorneys must be bilingual in order to litigate in english in u s federal courts and litigate federal preemption issues in puerto rican courts title 48 of the united states code outlines the role of the united states code to united states territories and insular areas such as puerto rico after the u s government assumed control of puerto rico in 1901 it initiated legal reforms resulting in the adoption of codes of criminal law criminal procedure and civil procedure modeled after those then in effect in california although puerto rico has since followed the federal example of transferring criminal and civil procedure from statutory law to rules promulgated by the judiciary several portions of its criminal law still reflect the influence of the california penal code the judicial branch is headed by the chief justice of the puerto rico supreme court which is the only appellate court required by the constitution all other courts are created by the legislative assembly of puerto rico there is also a federal district court for puerto rico someone accused of a criminal act at the federal level may not be accused for the same act in a commonwealth court unlike a state court since puerto rico as a territory lacks sovereignty separate from congress as a state does 243 such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardy political status main articles political status of puerto rico and proposed political status for puerto rico the nature of puerto political relationship with the u s is the subject of ongoing debate in puerto rico the united states congress and the united nations 244 specifically the basic question is whether puerto rico should remain a u s territory become a u s state or become an independent country 245 within the united states the capitol of puerto rico home of the legislative assembly in puerto rico constitutionally puerto rico is subject to the plenary powers of the united states congress under the territorial clause of article iv of the u s constitution 246 laws enacted at the federal level in the united states apply to puerto rico as well regardless of its political status their residents do not have voting representation in the u s congress like the different states of the united states puerto rico lacks the full sovereignty of an independent nation for example the power to manage its external relations with other nations which is held by the u s federal government the supreme court of the united states has indicated that once the u s constitution has been extended to an area by congress or the courts its coverage is irrevocable to hold that the political branches may switch the constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they not this court say what the law is 247 puerto ricans were collectively made u s citizens in 1917 as a result of the jones shafroth act 248 u s citizens residing in puerto rico cannot vote for the u s president though both major parties republican and democratic run primary elections in puerto rico to send delegates to vote on a presidential candidate since puerto rico is an unincorporated territory see above and not a u s state the united states constitution does not fully enfranchise u s citizens residing in puerto rico 236 249 only fundamental rights under the american federal constitution and adjudications are applied to puerto ricans various other u s supreme court decisions have held which rights apply in puerto rico and which ones do not puerto ricans have a long history of service in the u s armed forces and since 1917 they have been included in the u s compulsory draft whensoever it has been in effect though the commonwealth government has its own tax laws puerto ricans are also required to pay many kinds of u s federal taxes not including the federal personal income tax for puerto rico sourced income but only under certain circumstances 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 in 2009 puerto rico paid $3.742 billion into the u s treasury 258 residents of puerto rico pay into social security and are thus eligible for social security benefits upon retirement they are excluded from the supplemental security income ssi and the island actually receives a smaller fraction of the medicaid funding it would receive if it were a u s state 259 also medicare providers receive less than full state like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in puerto rico even though the latter paid fully into the system 260 while a state may try an individual for the same crime he she was tried in federal court this is not the case in puerto rico being a u s territory puerto authority to enact a criminal code derives from congress and not from local sovereignty as with the states thus such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardy and is constitutionally impermissible 243 in 1992 president george h w bush issued a memorandum to heads of executive departments and agencies establishing the current administrative relationship between the federal government and the commonwealth of puerto rico this memorandum directs all federal departments agencies and officials to treat puerto rico administratively as if it were a state insofar as doing so would not disrupt federal programs or operations many federal executive branch agencies have significant presence in puerto rico just as in any state including the federal bureau of investigation federal emergency management agency transportation security administration social security administration and others while puerto rico has its own commonwealth judicial system similar to that of a u s state there is also a u s federal

spain the dominican republic panama colombia washington d c new york city and florida and has included in the past offices in chile costa rica and mexico such agreements require permission from the u

the u s army at ft buchanan the puerto rican army and air national guards and the u s coast guard protests over the noise of bombing practice forced the closure of the naval base this resulted in a

public and private entities in puerto rico such as retired military who rely on ft buchanan for the services available there puerto ricans have participated in many of the military conflicts in which the united states has been involved for example they participated in the american revolution when volunteers from puerto rico cuba and mexico fought the british in 1779 under the command of general

high income economy by the world bank and as the most competitive economy in latin america by the world economic forum but puerto rico currently has a public debt of $72.204 billion equivalent to 103% of gnp and a government deficit of $2.5 billion 270 271 according to world bank gross national income per capita of puerto rico in 2013 is $23,830 ppp international dollars ranked as 63rd among all sovereign and dependent territories entities in the world 272 its economy is mainly driven by manufacturing primarily pharmaceuticals textiles petrochemicals and electronics followed by the service industry primarily finance insurance real estate and tourism n o in recent years the territory has also become a popular destination for mice meetings incentives conferencing exhibitions with a modern convention centre district overlooking the port of san juan 274 the geography of puerto rico and its political status are both determining factors on its economic prosperity primarily due to its relatively small size as an island its lack of natural resources used to produce raw materials citation needed and consequently its dependence on imports as well as its territorial status with the united states which controls its foreign policy while exerting trading restrictions particularly in its shipping industry puerto rico experienced a recession from 2006 to 2011 interrupted by 4 quarters of economic growth and entered into recession again in 2013 following growing fiscal imbalance and the expiration of the irs section 936 corporate incentives that the u s internal revenue code had applied to puerto rico this irs section was critical to the economy as it established tax exemptions for u s corporations that settled in puerto rico and allowed their insular subsidiaries to send their earnings to the parent corporation at any time without paying federal tax on corporate income puerto rico has surprisingly been able to maintain a relatively low inflation in the past decade while maintaining a purchasing power parity per capita higher than 80% of the rest of the world 275 academically most of puerto economic woes stem from federal regulations that expired have been repealed or no longer apply to puerto rico its inability to become self sufficient and self sustainable throughout history p its highly politicized public policy which tends to change whenever a political party gains power q as well as its highly inefficient local government r s which has accrued a public debt equal to 68% of its gross domestic product throughout time t u in comparison to the different states of the united states puerto rico is poorer than mississippi the poorest state of the u s with 41% of its population below the poverty line v when compared to latin america puerto rico has the highest gdp per capita in the region its main trading partners are the united states itself ireland and japan with most products coming from east asia mainly from china hong kong and taiwan at a global scale puerto dependency on oil for transportation and electricity generation as well as its dependency on food imports and raw materials makes puerto rico volatile and highly reactive to changes in the world economy and climate puerto agricultural sector represents less than 1% of gnp 282 heavy debt load in early 2017 the puerto rican government debt crisis posed serious problems for the government which was saddled with outstanding bond debt that had climbed to $70 billion at a time with a 45 percent poverty rate and 12.4% unemployment that is more than twice the mainland u s average 283 the debt had been increasing during a decade long recession 27 the commonwealth had been defaulting on many debts including bonds since 2015 with debt payments due the governor was facing the risk of a government shutdown and failure to fund the managed health care system 284 285 without action before april puerto ability to execute contracts for fiscal year 2018 with its managed care organizations will be threatened thereby putting at risk beginning july 1 2017 the health care of up to 900,000 poor u s citizens living in puerto rico according to a letter sent to congress by the secretary of the treasury and the secretary of health and human services they also said that congress must enact measures recommended by both republicans and democrats that fix puerto inequitable health care financing structure and promote sustained economic growth 285 initially the oversight board created under promesa called for puerto governor ricardo to deliver a fiscal turnaround plan by january 28 just before that deadline the control board gave the commonwealth government until february 28 to present a fiscal plan including negotiations with creditors for restructuring debt to solve the problems a moratorium on lawsuits by debtors was extended to may 31 27 it is essential for puerto rico to reach restructuring deals to avoid a bankruptcy like process under promesa 286 an internal survey conducted by the puerto rican economists association revealed that the majority of puerto rican economists reject the policy recommendations of the board and the government with more than 80% of economists arguing in favor of auditing the debt 287 in early august 2017 the financial oversight board created by promesa planned to institute two days off without pay per month for government employees down from the original plan of four days per month the latter had been expected to achieve $218 million in savings governor rossello rejected this plan as unjustified and unnecessary pension reforms were also discussed including a proposal for a 10% reduction in benefits to begin addressing the $50 billion in unfunded pension liabilities 30 288 public finances main articles puerto rico government debt crisis budget of the government of puerto rico and public debt of puerto rico puerto rico has an operating budget of about u s 9 8 billion with expenses at about $10.4 billion creating a structural deficit of $775 million about 7.9% of the budget 289 the practice of approving budgets with a structural deficit has been done for 17 consecutive years starting in 2000 throughout those years including present time all budgets contemplated issuing bonds to cover said projected deficits rather than make proper adjustments this practice eroded puerto treasury as the government had already been issuing bonds to balance its actual budget for four decades since 1973 w 291 the 2012 budget of the government of puerto rico projected deficits added substantial burdens to an already indebted nation which accrued a public debt of 71b or about 70% of puerto gross domestic product this sparked an ongoing government debt crisis after puerto general obligation bonds were downgraded to speculative non investment grade junk status by three credit rating agencies in terms of financial control almost about $1.5 puerto central government budget expenses for fy2014 is expected to be spent on debt service x harsher budget cuts are expected as puerto rico must now repay larger chunks of debts in the following years needs update for practical reasons the budget is divided into two aspects a general budget which comprises the assignments funded exclusively by the department of treasury of puerto rico and the consolidated budget which comprises the assignments funded by the general budget by puerto government owned corporations by revenue expected from loans by the sale of government bonds by subsidies extended by the federal government of the united states and by other funds both budgets contrast each other drastically with the consolidated budget being usually thrice the size of the general budget currently 29b and 9 0b respectively almost one out of every four dollars in the consolidated budget comes from u s federal subsidies while government owned corporations compose more than 31% of the consolidated budget the critical aspects come from the sale of bonds which comprise 7% of the consolidated budget a ratio that increased annually due to the inability to prepare a balanced budget in addition to being incapable of generating enough income to cover all its expenses in particular the government owned corporations add a heavy burden to the overall budget and public debt as not a single one is self sufficient all of them carrying extremely inefficient operations for example in fy2011 the government owned corporations reported aggregated losses of more than 1 3b with the puerto rico highways and transportation authority prhta reporting losses of 409m the puerto rico electric power authority prepa the government monopoly that controls all electricity on the island reporting losses of 272m while the puerto rico aqueducts and sewers authority prasa the government monopoly that controls all water utilities on the island reported losses of 112m 293 losses by government owned corporations have been defrayed through the issuance of bonds compounding more than 40% of puerto entire public debt today 294 holistically from puerto debt grew at a compound annual growth rate cagr of 9% while gdp remained stagnant 295 this has not always provided a long term solution in early july 2017 for example the prepa power authority was effectively bankrupt after defaulting in a plan to restructure $9 billion in bond debt the agency planned to seek court protection 296 in terms of protocol the governor together with the puerto rico office of management and budget ogp in spanish formulates the budget he believes is required to operate all government branches for the ensuing fiscal year he then submits this formulation as a budget request to the puerto rican legislature before july 1 the date established by law as the beginning of puerto fiscal year while the constitution establishes that the request must be submitted at the beginning of each regular session the request is typically submitted during the first week of may as the regular sessions of the legislature begin in january and it would be unpractical to submit a request so far ahead once submitted the budget is then approved by the legislature typically with amendments through a joint resolution and referred back to the governor for his approval the governor then either approves it or vetoes it if vetoed the legislature can then either refer it back with amendments for the approval or approve it without the consent by two thirds of the bodies of each chamber 297 once approved the department of treasury disburses funds to the office of management and budget which in turn disburses the funds to the respective agencies all while the puerto rico government development bank the intergovernmental bank manages all related banking affairs including those related to the government owned corporations cost of living a map of jones act carrier routes for puerto rico the cost of living in puerto rico is high and has increased over the past decade y 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 san in particular is higher than atlanta dallas and seattle but lower than boston chicago and new york city 305 one factor is housing prices which are comparable to miami and los angeles although property taxes are considerably lower than most places in the united states z statistics used for cost of living sometimes do not take into account certain costs such as the high cost of electricity which has hovered in the to range per kilowatt hour two to three times the national average increased travel costs for longer flights additional shipping fees and the loss of promotional participation opportunities for customers outside the continental united states while some online stores do offer free shipping on orders to puerto rico many merchants exclude hawaii alaska puerto rico and other united states territories the household median income is stated as $19,350 and the mean income as $30,463 in the u s census 2015 update the report also indicates that 45.5% of individuals are below the poverty level 307 the median home value in puerto rico ranges from u s 100 000 to u s 214 000 while the national median home value sits at $119,600. aa one of the most cited contributors to the high cost of living in puerto rico is the merchant marine act of 1920 also known as the jones act which prevents foreign flagged ships from carrying cargo between two american ports a practice known as cabotage 309 because of the jones act foreign ships inbound with goods from central and south america western europe and africa cannot stop in puerto rico offload puerto rico bound goods load mainland bound puerto rico manufactured goods and continue to u s ports instead they must proceed directly to u s ports where distributors break bulk and send puerto rico bound manufactured goods to puerto rico across the ocean by u s flagged ships 309 the local government of puerto rico has requested several times to the u s congress to exclude puerto rico from the jones act restrictions without success ab the most recent measure has been taken by the 17th legislative assembly of puerto rico through r conc del s 21 311 312 these measures have always received support from all the major local political parties in 2013 the government accountability office published a report which concluded that repealing or amending the jones act cabotage law might cut puerto rico shipping costs and that shippers believed that opening the trade to non u s flag competition could lower costs ac ad however the same gao report also found that shippers doing business in puerto rico that gao contacted reported that the freight rates are not for foreign carriers going to and from puerto rico and foreign locations than the rates shippers pay to ship similar cargo to and
