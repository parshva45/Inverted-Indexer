etymology main article name of mexico depiction of the founding myth of mexico tenochtitlan from the codex mendoza is the nahuatl term for the heartland of the aztec empire namely 34 the valley of mexico and its people the mexica and surrounding territories this became the future state of mexico as a division of new spain prior to independence compare latium it is generally considered to be a toponym for the valley which became the primary ethnonym for the aztec triple alliance as a result or vice versa after new spain won independence from spain representatives decided to name the new country after its capital mexico city this was founded in 1524 on top of the ancient mexica capital of mexico tenochtitlan traditionally the name tenochtitlan was thought to come from nahuatl tetl rock and prickly pear and is often thought to mean among the prickly pears growing among rocks however one attestation in the late 16th century manuscript known as the bancroft dialogues suggests the second vowel was short so that the true etymology remains uncertain 35 the suffix co is the nahuatl locative making the word a place name beyond that the etymology is uncertain it has been suggested that it is derived from mextli or a secret name for the god of war and patron of the mexica huitzilopochtli in which case means place where huitzilopochtli lives 36 another hypothesis suggests that derives from a portmanteau of the nahuatl words for moon and navel 37 this meaning place at the center of the moon might refer to position in the middle of lake texcoco the system of interconnected lakes of which texcoco formed the center had the form of a rabbit which the mesoamericans pareidolically associated with the moon still another hypothesis suggests that the word is derived from the goddess of maguey 37 the name of the city state was transliterated to spanish as with the phonetic value of the letter x in medieval spanish which represented the voiceless postalveolar fricative this sound as well as the voiced postalveolar fricative represented by a j evolved into a voiceless velar fricative x during the 16th century this led to the use of the variant in many publications in spanish most notably in spain whereas in mexico and most other countries was the preferred spelling in recent years the real academia which regulates the spanish language determined that both variants are acceptable in spanish but that the normative recommended spelling is 38 the majority of publications in all spanish speaking countries now adhere to the new norm even though the alternative variant is still occasionally used citation needed in english the x in mexico represents neither the original nor the current sound but the consonant cluster ks the official name of the country has changed as the form of government has changed the declaration of independence signed on november 6 1813 by the deputies of the congress of called the territory septentrional northern america on two occasions and the country was known as imperio mexicano mexican empire all three federal constitutions 1824 1857 and 1917 the current constitution used the name estados unidos mexicanos 39 the variant

the pyramid of the moon and entrance to the palace during its peak in the classic era teotihuacan dominated the valley of mexico and exerted political and cultural influence in other areas such as in the basin the earliest human artifacts in mexico are chips of stone tools found near campfire remains in the valley of mexico and radiocarbon dated to circa 10,000 years ago 42 mexico is the site of the domestication of maize tomato and beans which produced an agricultural surplus this enabled the transition from paleo indian hunter gatherers to sedentary agricultural villages beginning around 5000 bce 43 in the subsequent formative eras maize cultivation and cultural traits such as a mythological and religious complex and a vigesimal numeric system were diffused from the mexican cultures to the rest of the mesoamerican culture area 44 in this period villages became more dense in terms of population becoming socially stratified with an artisan class and developing into chiefdoms the most powerful rulers had religious and political power organizing construction of large ceremonial centers developed 45 the earliest complex civilization in mexico was the olmec culture which flourished on the gulf coast from around 1500 bce olmec cultural traits diffused through mexico into other formative era cultures in chiapas oaxaca and the valley of mexico the formative period saw the spread of distinct religious and symbolic traditions as well as artistic and architectural complexes 46 the formative era of mesoamerica is considered one of the six independent cradles of civilization in the subsequent pre classical period the maya and zapotec civilizations developed complex centers at calakmul and monte respectively during this period the first true mesoamerican writing systems were developed in the epi olmec and the zapotec cultures the mesoamerican writing tradition reached its height in the classic maya hieroglyphic script 47 in central mexico the height of the classic period saw the ascendancy of teotihuacan which formed a military and commercial empire whose political influence stretched south into the maya area as well as north teotihuacan with a population of more than 150,000 people had some of the largest pyramidal structures in the pre columbian americas 48 after the collapse of around 600 ce competition ensued between several important political centers in central mexico such as xochicalco and cholula at this time during the epi classic nahua peoples began moving south into mesoamerica from the north and became politically and culturally dominant in central mexico as they displaced speakers of oto manguean languages post classic period ca ad mural by diego rivera depicting the view from the tlatelolco markets into mexico tenochtitlan one of the largest cities in the world at the time during the early post classic central mexico was dominated by the toltec culture oaxaca by the mixtec and the lowland maya area had important centers at and toward the end of the post classic period the mexica established dominance clarification needed alexander von humboldt originated the modern usage of aztec as a collective term applied to all the people linked by trade custom religion and language to the mexica state and the triple alliance in 1843 with the publication of the work of william h prescott it was adopted by most of the world including 19th century mexican scholars who considered it a way to distinguish present day mexicans from pre conquest mexicans this usage has been the subject of debate since the late 20th century 49 the aztec empire was an informal or hegemonic empire because it did not exert supreme authority over the conquered lands it was satisfied with the payment of tributes from them it was a discontinuous empire because not all dominated territories were connected for example the southern peripheral zones of xoconochco were not in direct contact with the center the hegemonic nature of the aztec empire was demonstrated by their restoration of local rulers to their former position after their city state was conquered the aztec did not interfere in local affairs as long as the tributes were paid 50 the aztec of central mexico built a tributary empire covering most of central mexico 51 the aztec were noted for practicing human sacrifice on a large scale along with this practice they avoided killing enemies on the battlefield their warring casualty rate was far lower than that of their spanish counterparts whose principal objective was immediate slaughter during battle 52 this distinct mesoamerican cultural tradition of human sacrifice ended with the spanish conquest in the 16th century over the next centuries mexican indigenous cultures were gradually subjected to spanish colonial rule 53 conquest of the aztec triple alliance further information spanish conquest of mexico and la malinche meet moctezuma ii the image is from the lienzo de tlaxcala

short time later 56 unintentionally introduced by spanish conquerors among whom smallpox was endemic the infectious disease ravaged mesoamerica in the 1520s it killed more than 3 million natives as they had no immunity 57 other sources however mentioned that the death toll of the aztecs might have reached 15 million out of a population of less than 30 million although such a high number conflicts with the 350,000 aztecs who ruled an empire of 5 million or 10 million 58 severely weakened the aztec empire was easily defeated by and his forces on his second return with the help of state of tlaxcala whose population estimate was 300,000 59 the native population declined by 1600 to million any population estimate of pre columbian mexico is bound to be a guess but million is often suggested for the area encompassed by the modern nation smallpox was a devastating disease it generally killed aztecs but not spaniards who as europeans had already been exposed to it in their cities for centuries and therefore had developed acquired immunity 60 the deaths caused by smallpox are believed to have triggered a rapid growth of christianity in mexico and the americas at first the aztecs believed the epidemic was a punishment from an angry god but they later accepted their fate and no longer resisted the spanish rule 61 many of the surviving aztecs believed that smallpox could be credited to the superiority of the christian god which resulted in their acceptance of catholicism and yielding to the spanish rule throughout mexico 62 the territory became part of the spanish

administrated the spanish west indies the caribbean the spanish east indies the philippines and spanish florida the indigenous population stabilized around one to one and a half million individuals in the 17th century from the most commonly accepted five to ten million pre contact population the population decline was primarily the result of communicable diseases particularly smallpox introduced

three main castas resulting from miscegenation of europeans africans and indigenous americans produced during the age of enlightenment the pinturas de castas attempted to rationally categorize the racial diversity of mexico but some sets were also manifestations of early national self pride wealth and order depicted through clothing mercantile goods and religious symbols challenged preconceived notions of new spain in europe 242 mexico is ethnically diverse with people of several ethnicities being united under a single national identity 243 the core part of mexican national identity is formed on the basis of a synthesis of cultures primarily european culture and indigenous cultures in a process known as mestizaje 243 244 mexican politicians and reformers such as vasconcelos promoter of the cosmic race and manuel gamio promoter of indigenismo were instrumental in building a mexican national identity on the concept of mestizaje 245 the large majority of mexicans have historically been classified as mestizos in modern mexican usage the term mestizo is primarily a cultural identity rather than the racial identity it was during the colonial era resulting in individuals with varying phenotypes being classified under the same identity regardless of wheter they are of mixed ancestry or not 246 since the term carries a variety of different socio cultural economic racial and biological meanings it was deemed too imprecise to be used for ethnic classification thus it was abandoned by the government and is not in wide use in mexican society 117 247 although often used in literature about mexican social identities and on intellectual circles in the peninsula the word mestizo has historically had a different meaning being used to refer to the maya speaking populations living in traditional communities because during the caste war of the late 19th century those maya who did not join the rebellion were classified as mestizos 248 in chiapas the word ladino is used instead of mestizo 249 according to britannica racially mestizo mexicans make up 50% to 67% of the population 250 the total percentage of population who is indigenous varies considerably depending of the criteria used by the government on its censuses it is 5.4% if the hability to speak an indigenous language is used as the criteria to define a person as indigenous 251 if racial self identification is used 14.9% 252 253 and if people who considers themselves part indigenous are also included it amounts to 21.5 254 nonetheless all the censuses conclude that the majority of indigenous population is concentrated in the southern and south eastern mexican states primarily in rural areas some indigenous communities have a degree of autonomy under the legislation of usos y costumbres which allows them to regulate some internal issues under customary law according to the national commission for the development of indigenous peoples the states with the greatest proportion of indigenous residents are 255 at 59 quintana roo 39% and campeche 27 chiefly maya oaxaca with 48% of the population the most numerous groups being the mixtec and zapotec peoples chiapas at 28 the majority being tzeltal and tzotzil maya hidalgo 24 the majority being otomi puebla 19 and guerrero 17 mostly nahua peoples and the states of san luis and veracruz both home to a population that is 15% indigenous mostly from the totonac nahua and teenek huastec groups 256 the absolute numbers of the indigenous population growing but at a slower rate than the rest of the population so that the percentage of indigenous peoples in regards to total population is nonetheless falling 257 all of the indices of social development for the indigenous population are considerably lower than the national average in all states indigenous people have higher infant mortality in some states almost double of the non indigenous populations literacy rates are also much lower with 27% of indigenous children between 6 and 14 being illiterate compared to a national average of 12 the indigenous population participate in the workforce longer than the national average starting earlier and continuing longer however 55% of the indigenous population receive less than a minimum salary compared to 20% for the national average many practice subsistence agriculture and receive no salaries indigenous people also have less access to health care and a lower quality of housing 256 similarly to mestizo and indigenous peoples estimations for the percentage of european descended mexicans within the mexican population vary considerably their numbers range from around according to the britannica 250 to as high as 47% 258 259 according to a nationwide survey conducted by government made with the intent of having a precise outlook of the social and economic inequalities that exist between light skinned european looking mexicans and indigenous or african looking mexicans 260 is the first time the mexican government has conducted an official population study that referenced white population in nearly a century while during the colonial era most of the european migration into mexico was spanish in the 19th and 20th centuries a substantial number of non spanish europeans immigrated to the country according to 20th and 21st century academics large scale intermixing between european immigrants and native indigenous peoples would produce a mestizo group which would become the overwhelming majority of population by the time of the mexican revolution 261 however according to church registers from the colonial times the majority of european men married with european women said registers also put in question other narratives held by contemporary academics such as european migrants who arrived to mexico being almost exclusively men 262 nowadays northern and western regions have the highest european populations with the majority of the people not having native admixture or being of predominantly european ancestry 263 the afro mexican population 1,381,853 individuals as of 2015 update 264 is an ethnic group made up of descendants of colonial era slaves and recent immigrants of sub saharan african descent mexico had an active slave trade during the colonial period and some 200,000 africans were taken there primarily in the 17th century the creation of a national mexican identity especially after the mexican revolution emphasized indigenous and european past it passively eliminated the african ancestors and contributions most of the african descended population was absorbed into the surrounding mestizo mixed european indigenous and indigenous populations through unions among the groups evidence of this long history of intermarriage with mestizo and indigenous mexicans is also expressed in the fact that in the 2015 inter census 64.9% 896,829 of afro mexicans also identified as indigenous it was also reported that 9.3% of afro mexicans speak an indigenous language 265 the states with the highest self report of afro mexicans were guerrero 6 5 of the population oaxaca 4.95 and veracruz 3.28 266 afro mexican culture is strongest in the communities of the costa chica of oaxaca and costa chica of guerrero during the early 20th century a substantial number of arabs mostly christians 267 began arriving from the crumbling ottoman empire the largest group were the lebanese and an estimated 400,000 mexicans have some lebanese ancestry 268 smaller ethnic groups in mexico include south and east asians present since the colonial era during the colonial era asians were termed chino regardless of ethnicity and arrived as merchants artisans and slaves 269 the largest group were filipinos and some 200,000 mexicans can trace filipino ancestry 270 modern asian immigration began in the late 19th century and at one point in the early 20th century the chinese were the second largest immigrant group 271 official censuses the first census in mexico that included an ethnic classification was the 1793 census also known as the revillagigedo census it was then known as new spain first national population census most of its original datasets have reportedly been lost thus most of what is known about it nowadays comes from essays and field investigations made by academics who had access to the census data and used it as reference for their works such as prussian geographer alexander von humboldt while every author gives different estimations for each racial group in the country they seem to vary much with europeans ranging from 18% to 22% of new population mestizos ranging from 21% to 25 indians ranging from 51% to 61% and africans being between 6,000 and 10,000 the estimations given for the total population range from 3,799,561 to 6,122,354 it is concluded then that across nearly three centuries of colonization the population growth trends of whites and mestizos were even while the total percentage of the indigenous population decreased at a rate of per century the authors assert that rather than whites and mestizos having higher birthrates the reason for the indigenous numbers decreasing lies on them suffering of higher mortality rates due living in remote locations rather than on cities and towns founded by the spanish colonists or being at war with them 272 anthropologist gonzalo aguirre goes beyond said numbers and splits the mestizo group into euromestizos indomestizos and afromestizos calculating their numbers on more than one million 700,000 and 600,000 respectively 273 independent era mexico eliminated the legal basis of the colonial caste system which led to exclude racial classification in the censuses to come according to second census ever which considered race made right after the mexican revolution on 1921 274 59% of population was mestizo 29% was indigenous and only 9% was european with mestizos being the most numerous ethno racial group in almost all the states 274 for a long time this census results have been taken as fact with extraofficial international publications such as the world factbook and britannica using them as a reference to estimate racial composition up to this day 275 250 however in recent time mexican academics have subjected the census results to scrutiny claiming that such a drastic alteration on demographic trends in regards to the 1793 census is not possible and cite among other statistics the relatively low frequency of marriages between people of different continental ancestries in colonial and early independent mexico 276 said authors claim that the mexican society went through a more cultural than biological mestizaje process sponsored by the state on its efforts to unify the mexican population which resulted on the inflation of the percentage of the mestizo mexican group at the expense of the identity of the other races that exist in mexico 277 in recent times the mexican government has decided to conduct ethnic surveys and censuses again and has also widen the criteria to classify the ethnicies who were already considered an example being the indigenous mexican classification which was previously reserved to people who lived in indigenous communities and or spoke an indigenous language according to these recent surveys indigenous peoples amount to 21.5% of population including people who declared to be partially indigenous 254 afro mexicans are 1.2% of population including people who declared to be partially african 254 and european mexicans amount to 47% of population based on appearance rather than on self declared of ancestry 258 259 260 less numerous groups in mexico such as asians and middle easterners are also accounted for albeit their numbers do not vary significantly from previous estimations out of all the ethnic groups that have recently been surveyed that of mestizos is notably absent which may be consequence of the ethnic fluid and subjective definition which complicates a precise calculation as well the tendency that mexicans have to identify people with static ethnic labels rather than fluid ones 278 languages main article languages of mexico the country has the largest spanish speaking population in the world with almost a third of all spanish native speakers 236 279 almost all of the mexican population speaks spanish 99.3% according to the latest census 280

and some 364 different specific varieties of indigenous languages 284 since the promulgation of the law of indigenous linguistic rights in 2003 these languages have had status as national languages with equal validity with spanish in all the areas and contexts in which they are spoken 285 in addition to the indigenous languages other minority languages are spoken by immigrant populations such as
