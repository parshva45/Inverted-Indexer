to gather weather data currently the us organizations that fly these missions are the united states air force reserve s 53d weather reconnaissance squadron and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s hurricane hunters such missions have also been flown by navy units and other air force and noaa units manned flights into hurricanes began in 1943 when on a bet pilot trainer colonel joseph duckworth flew a single engine plane into a category 1 storm near galveston texas since then six military weather reconnaissance planes have gone down at a cost of fifty three lives 1 2 3 in one such incident six of the seven crew members of the navy pb4y 2 buno 59415 were killed on october 1 1945 when their plane went down in a category 1 typhoon over the south china sea 4 before satellites were used to find storms military aircraft flew routine weather reconnaissance tracks to detect formation of tropical cyclones today satellites have improved weather forecasters ability to detect signs of such cyclones before they form yet they cannot determine the interior barometric pressure of a hurricane nor provide accurate wind speed information data needed to accurately predict

1943 surprise hurricane which struck houston texas during world war ii marked the first intentional meteorological flight into a hurricane it started with a bet that summer british pilots were being trained in instrument flying at bryan field when they saw that the americans were evacuating their at 6 texan trainers in the face of the storm they began questioning the construction of the aircraft lead instructor colonel joe duckworth took one of the trainers out and flew it straight into the eye of the storm after he returned safely with navigator lt ralph the weather officer lt william jones burdick took over the seat and duckworth flew into the storm a second time this flight showed that hurricane reconnaissance flights were possible and further flights continued occasionally in 1946 the
