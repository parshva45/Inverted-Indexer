lewis carroll s adventures in wonderland depicting the fictional protagonist alice playing a fantastical game of croquet fiction is the classification for any story or setting that is derived from imagination other words not based strictly on history or fact 1 2 3 fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats including writings live performances films television programs animations video games and role playing games though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature see literary fiction 4 including novels novellas short stories and plays fiction is occasionally used in its narrowest sense to mean simply any literary narrative 5 a work of fiction is an act of creative imagination so its total faithfulness to the real world is not typically assumed by its audience 6 therefore fiction is not commonly expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually accurate instead the context of fiction not adhering precisely to the real world is generally understood as being more open to interpretation 7 characters and events within a fictional work may even be set in their own context entirely separate from the known universe an independent fictional universe fiction is regarded as the traditional opposite of non fiction whose creators assume responsibility for presenting only the historical and factual truth however the distinction between fiction and non fiction can be unclear for example in postmodern literature 8 contents 1 formats 2 genre fiction 3 literary fiction 4 realism 5 see also 6

narrative poetry plays including operas musicals dramas puppet plays and various kinds of theatrical dances however fiction may also encompass comic books and many animated cartoons stop motions anime manga films video games radio programs television programs comedies and dramas etc the internet has had a major impact on the creation and distribution of fiction calling into question the feasibility of copyright as a means to ensure royalties are paid to copyright holders 9 also digital libraries such as project gutenberg make public domain texts more readily available the combination of inexpensive home computers the internet and the creativity of its users has also led to new forms of fiction such as interactive computer games or computer generated comics countless forums for fan fiction can be found online where loyal followers of specific fictional realms create and distribute derivative stories the internet is also used for the development of blog fiction where a story is delivered through a blog either as flash fiction or serial blog and collaborative fiction where a story is written sequentially by different authors or the entire text can be revised by anyone using a wiki types of literary fiction in prose 10 short story a work of at least 2,000 words but under 7,500 words the boundary between a long short story and a novella is vague 11 novella a work of at least

commonly broken down into a variety of genres subsets of fiction each differentiated by a particular unifying tone or style narrative technique media content or popularly defined criterion science fiction for example predicts or supposes technologies that are not realities at the time of the creation for example jules verne s novel from the earth to the moon was published in 1865 and only in 1969 did astronaut neil armstrong first land on the moon historical fiction places imaginary characters into real historical events in the early historical novel waverley sir walter scott s fictional character edward waverley meets a figure from history bonnie prince charlie and takes part in the battle of prestonpans some works of fiction are slightly or greatly re imagined based on some originally true story or a reconstructed biography 13 often even when the author claims the fictional story is basically true there may be artificial additions and subtractions from the true story to make it more interesting one such example would be tim the things they carried a series of historical fiction short stories about the vietnam war fictional works that explicitly involve supernatural magical or scientifically impossible elements are often classified under the genre of fantasy including lewis carroll s alice in wonderland j k rowling s harry potter series and j r r tolkien s the lord of the rings creators of fantasy sometimes introduce entire imaginary creatures or beings such as dragons and fairies 3 literary fiction edit main article literature literary fiction is defined as fictional works that are deemed to be of literary merit as distinguished from most commercial or genre fiction the distinction can be controversial among critics and scholars neal stephenson has suggested that while any definition will be simplistic there is today a general cultural difference between literary and genre fiction on the one hand literary authors nowadays are frequently supported by patronage with employment at a university or a similar institution and with the continuation of such positions determined not by book sales but by critical acclaim by other established literary authors and critics on the other hand he suggests genre fiction writers tend to support themselves by book sales 14 however in an interview john updike lamented that the category of literary fiction has sprung up recently to torment people like me who just set out to write books and if anybody wanted to read them terrific the more the merrier a genre writer of a sort i write literary fiction which is like spy fiction or chick lit 15 likewise on the charlie rose show he argued that this term when applied to his work greatly limited him and his expectations of what might come of his writing so he does not really like it he suggested that all his works are literary simply because they are written in words 16 literary fiction often involves social commentary political criticism or reflection on the human condition 17 in general it focuses on introspective in depth character studies of interesting complex and developed characters 17 18 this contrasts with genre fiction where plot is the central concern 19 usually in literary fiction the focus is on the inner story of the characters who drive the plot with detailed motivations to elicit emotional involvement in the reader 20 21 the style of literary fiction is often described as elegantly written lyrical and layered 22 the tone of literary fiction can be darker than genre fiction 23 while the pacing of literary fiction may be slower than popular fiction 23 as terrence rafferty notes literary fiction by its nature allows itself to dawdle to linger on stray beauties even at the risk of losing its way 24 realism edit see also literary realism realistic fiction typically involves a story whose basic setting time and location in the world is real and whose events could feasibly happen in a real world setting non realistic fiction involves a story where the opposite is the case often being set in an entirely imaginary universe an alternative history of the world other than that currently understood as true or some other non existent location or time period sometimes even presenting impossible technology or a defiance of the currently understood laws of nature however all types of fiction arguably invite their audience to explore real ideas issues or possibilities in an otherwise imaginary setting or using what is understood about reality to mentally construct something similar to reality though still distinct from it note 1 note 2 in terms of the traditional separation between fiction and non fiction the lines are now commonly understood as blurred showing more overlap than mutual exclusion even fiction usually has elements of or grounding in truth the distinction between the two may be best defined from the perspective of the audience according to whom a work is regarded as non fiction if its people places and events are all historically or factually real while a work is regarded as fiction if it deviates from reality in any of those areas the distinction between fiction and non fiction is further obscured by an understanding on the one hand that the truth can be presented through imaginary channels and constructions while on the other hand imagination can just as well bring about significant conclusions about truth and reality citation needed literary critic james wood argues that fiction is both artifice and verisimilitude meaning that it requires both creative invention as well as some acceptable degree of believability 25 a notion often encapsulated in poet samuel taylor coleridge s term willing suspension of disbelief also infinite fictional possibilities themselves signal the impossibility of fully knowing reality provocatively demonstrating that there is no criterion to measure constructs of reality 26 see also edit main list outline of fiction character arts fiction writing pseudohistory notes edit as philosopher stacie friend explains in reading we take works of fiction like works of non fiction to be about the real if they invite us to imagine the world to be different from how it actually is thus imagining a storyworld does not mean directing imagining toward something other than the real world it is instead a mental activity that involves constructing a complex representation of what a story portrays friend s the real foundation of fictional worlds australasian journal of philosophy 1 the research of weisberg and goodstein
