shaped cloud that occurs over a body of water some are connected to a cumulus congestus cloud some to a cumuliform cloud and some to a cumulonimbus cloud 1 in the common form it is a non supercell tornado over water 1 2 3 while it is often weaker than most of its land counterparts stronger versions spawned by mesocyclones do occur 4 5 most waterspouts do not suck up water they are small and weak rotating columns of air over water 1 6 while waterspouts form mostly in the tropics and subtropical areas 1 other areas also report waterspouts including europe new zealand the great lakes antarctica 7 8 and on rare occasions the great salt lake 9 although rare waterspouts have been observed in connection with lake effect snow precipitation bands waterspouts have a five part life cycle

where their environment is less than two kilometers in width the cloud from which they develop can be as innocuous as a moderate cumulus or as great as a supercell while some waterspouts are strong and tornadic in nature most are much weaker and caused by different atmospheric dynamics they normally develop in moisture laden environments as their parent clouds are in the process of development and it is theorized they spin as they move up the surface boundary from the horizontal shear near the surface and then stretch upwards to the cloud once the low level shear vortex aligns with a developing cumulus cloud or thunderstorm weak tornadoes known as landspouts have been shown to develop in a similar manner 10 more than one waterspout can occur in the same vicinity at the same time as many as nine simultaneous waterspouts have been reported on lake michigan 7 the illustration on the left by james pollard espy in 1841 shows the manner in which one spout while forming tends to generate others in its neighborhood types edit non tornadic edit non tornadic waterspouts seen from the beach at kijkduin near the hague the netherlands on 27 august 2006 tornadic waterspout on 15 july 2005 off the coast of punta gorda florida caused by a severe thunderstorm waterspouts that are not associated with a rotating updraft of a supercell thunderstorm are known as non tornadic or fair weather waterspouts and are by far the most common type fair weather waterspouts occur in coastal waters and are associated with dark flat bottomed developing convective cumulus towers waterspouts of this type rapidly develop and dissipate having life cycles shorter than 10 they usually rate no higher than ef0 on the enhanced fujita scale generally exhibiting winds of less than 11 they are most frequently seen in tropical and sub tropical climates with upwards of 400 per year observed in the florida keys 12 they typically move slowly if at all since the cloud to which they are attached is horizontally static being formed by vertical convective action instead of the subduction adduction interaction between colliding fronts 12 13 fair weather waterspouts are very similar in both appearance and mechanics to landspouts and largely behave as such if they move ashore 12 tornadic edit tornadic waterspouts also accurately referred to as tornadoes over water are formed from mesocyclonic action in a manner essentially identical to traditional land based tornadoes in connection with severe thunderstorms but simply occurring over water 14 a tornado which travels from land to a body of water would also be considered a tornadic waterspout 15 since the vast majority of mesocyclonic thunderstorms occur in land locked areas of the united states true tornadic waterspouts are correspondingly rarer than their fair weather counterparts in that country however in some areas such as the adriatic aegean and ionian seas tornadic waterspouts can make up half of the total number 16 snowspout edit a large winter waterspout over lake ontario just off the shore of whitby ontario on 26 january 1994 a winter waterspout also known as a snow devil an icespout an ice devil a snownado or a snowspout is an extremely rare instance of a waterspout forming under the base of a snow squall 17 18 the term winter waterspout is used to differentiate between the common warm season waterspout and this rare winter season event very little is known about this phenomenon and only six known pictures of this event exist to date four of which were taken in ontario canada there are a couple of critical criteria for the formation of a winter waterspout very cold temperatures need to be present over a body of water warm enough to produce fog resembling steam above the surface like the more efficient lake effect snow events winds focusing down the axis of long lakes enhance wind convergence and likely enhance their development 19 climatology edit a family of four waterspouts seen on the great lakes lake huron on 9 september 1999 four waterspouts seen in the florida keys on 5 june 2009 though the majority of waterspouts occur in the tropics they can seasonally appear in temperate areas throughout the world and are common across the western coast of europe as well as the british isles and several areas of the mediterranean and baltic sea they are not restricted to saltwater many have been reported on lakes and rivers including the great lakes and the st lawrence river 20 waterspouts are fairly common on the great lakes during late summer and early fall with a record 66+ waterspouts reported over just a seven day period in 2003 21 they are more frequent within from the coast than farther out at sea waterspouts are common along the southeast u s coast especially off southern florida and the keys and can happen over seas bays and lakes worldwide approximately 160 waterspouts are currently reported per year across europe with the netherlands reporting the most at 60 followed by spain and italy at 25 and the united kingdom at 15 they are most common in late summer in the northern hemisphere september has been pinpointed as the prime month of formation 22 waterspouts are frequently observed off the east coast of australia 23 24 with several being described by joseph banks during the voyage of the endeavour in 1770 25 life cycle edit there are five stages to the waterspout life cycle initially a prominent circular light colored disk appears on the surface of the water surrounded by a larger dark area of indeterminate shape after the formation of these colored disks on the water a pattern of light and dark colored spiral bands develop from the dark spot on the water surface then a dense annulus of sea spray called a cascade appears around the dark spot with what appears to be an eye eventually the waterspout becomes a visible funnel from the water surface to the overhead cloud the spray vortex can rise to a height of several hundred feet or more and often creates a visible wake and an associated wave train as it moves eventually the funnel and spray vortex begin to dissipate as the inflow of warm air into the vortex weakens ending the life cycle 13 waterspout filmed off anglesey wales on 12 november 2010 by an raf search and rescue crew marine hazard edit waterspouts have long been recognized as serious marine hazards stronger waterspouts pose threats to watercraft aircraft and people 26 it is recommended to keep a considerable distance from these phenomena and to always be on alert through weather reports the united states national weather service will often issue special marine warnings when waterspouts are likely or have been sighted over coastal waters or tornado warnings when waterspouts are expected to move onshore 27 incidents of waterspouts causing severe damage and casualties are rare however there have been several notable examples the malta tornado in 1555 was the earliest record of a deadly waterspout it struck the grand harbour of valletta sinking four galleys numerous boats and claiming hundreds of lives 28 the 1851 sicily tornadoes were twin waterspouts that made landfall in western sicily ravaging the coast and countryside before ultimately dissipating back again over the sea a waterspout has been proposed as a possible reason for the inexplicable abandonment of the mary celeste threat to marine animals edit see also rain of animals depending on how fast the winds from a waterspout are whipping anything that is within about one yard of the surface of the water including fish of different sizes frogs and even turtles can be lifted into the air 29 a waterspout can sometimes suck small animals such as fish out of the water and all the way up into the cloud even if the waterspout stops spinning the fish in the cloud can be carried over land buffeted up and down and around with the winds until its currents no longer keep the flying fish in the atmosphere depending on how far they travel and how high they are taken into the atmosphere the fish are sometimes dead by the time they rain down people as far as 100 miles inland have experienced raining fish 29 fish can also be sucked up from rivers but raining fish is not a common weather phenomenon 29 on september 28 2017 according to the associated press rain in tampico on northeastern mexico s gulf coast included fish 30 research and forecasting edit szilagyi waterspout index swi edit the szilagyi waterspout index swi developed by canadian meteorologist wade szilagyi is used to predict conditions favorable for waterspout development the swi ranges from to +10, where values greater than or equal to zero represent conditions favorable for waterspout development 31 32 international centre for waterspout research icwr edit the icwr is a non governmental organization of individuals from around the world who are interested in the field of waterspouts from a research operational and safety perspective 33
