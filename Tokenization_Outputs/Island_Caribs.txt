lesser antilles in the caribbean they may have descended from the mainland caribs kalina of south america but they spoke an unrelated language known as island carib at the time of spanish contact the caribs were one of the dominant groups in the caribbean which owes its name to them they lived throughout the windward islands dominica and possibly the southern leeward islands historically it was thought their ancestors were mainland caribs known as the igneri the igneri had conquered the islands from their previous inhabitants however linguistic and archaeological evidence disputes the notion of a mass emigration and conquest the island carib language appears not to have been cariban but arawakan like that of their neighbors the irving rouse and others suggest that a smaller group of mainland caribs conquered the islands without displacing their inhabitants eventually adopting the local language but retaining their traditions of a south american origin 3 in the early colonial period the caribs had a reputation as warriors who raided neighboring islands it was claimed that they practiced cannibalism the word cannibal derives from a corruption of their name 4 according to the spanish conquistadores the carib indians were cannibals who regularly ate roasted human flesh archaeological evidence indicates that they limited the consumption of humans to ceremonial occasions there is evidence as to the taking of human trophies and the ritual cannibalism of war captives among both carib and other amerindian groups such as the arawak and tupinamba today the caribs and their descendants continue to live in the antilles the garifuna or black caribs a group of mixed carib and african ancestry also live principally in central america contents 1 history 2 people 3 appearance

products which ponce de leon found in communities none of the insular amerindians mined for gold but obtained it by trade from the mainland the caribs were skilled boat builders and sailors they appeared to have owed their dominance in the caribbean basin to their mastery of warfare according to floyd the question arose in time whether indians could be enslaved and queen isabel had ruled against it at about the same time however ojeda bastidas and other explorers voyaging along the spanish main had been attacked by indians with poisoned arrows all such indians were considered caribs which took a considerable toll of spanish lives these attacks and the evidence some of the perpetrators at least were cannibals provided the rationale for the decree authorizing enslavement of caribs
