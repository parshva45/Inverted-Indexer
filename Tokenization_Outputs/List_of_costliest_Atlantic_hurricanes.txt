caused typically if a hurricane has caused significant damage to a particular location its name is retired so that it will not be re used as a name for any future hurricanes the costliest tropical cyclone ever recorded was hurricane harvey which caused catastrophic flooding in southeastern texas in causing $198.6 billion 2017 usd in property damage the costliest season on record was 2017 with damage estimated in excess of a majority of the costliest atlantic hurricanes in recorded history have peaked as major hurricanes however weaker tropical cyclones can still cause widespread damage both tropical storms allison in 2001 and lee in 2011 have caused over a billion in damage the former of which accounted for a higher damage total due to their excessive damage the names of tropical cyclones accruing at least in damage are often retired by the world meteorological organization however this is not always the case hurricane juan in 1985 was the first hurricane to cause at least a billion in damage and not be retired its name was retired on a later usage in 2003 that did not cause over a billion in damage since juan seven tropical cyclones that caused at least a billion in damage were not retired including hurricane emily in 2005 and the most recent of which being hurricane isaac in 2012 all other hurricanes to have caused as much damage have had their names retired excluding recent hurricanes harvey irma maria and ophelia of the 2017 season the first hurricane to cause at least in damage was hurricane betsy in 1965 which caused much of its damage in southeastern

flooding caused by hurricanes isabel gloria alex dennis ophelia gustav emily and several unnamed storms this list ranks tropical cyclones within the atlantic that have accrued at least us in damage

included in this list yet as final damage costs are not determined yet preliminary estimates for irma place the cost of the storm between $50 and $112 billion 1 2 3 4 5 6 preliminary estimates for
