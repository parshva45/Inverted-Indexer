landfall between north carolina and new jersey and the national hurricane center consistently forecast a landfall on north carolina 1 2 initially forecasters predicted a landfall in the northeastern portion of the state 1 though as the hurricane neared land the predicted landfall position was much closer to where it ultimately was from three days in advance the average track forecast error for its landfall was only and for in advance the average track error was strong confidence in final landfall prompted the national hurricane center to issue a hurricane watch for the entire north carolina coastline about before isabel struck land before the hurricane made landfall the national hurricane center upgraded the watch to a hurricane warning for the landfall area 3 the newport weather forecast office issued a flood potential statement two days before landfall which indicated a threat for flash flooding the office began preparing for the hurricane one week before landfall and brought additional staff members to assist with hurricane related duties 4 evacuation orders began on september 16 when officials issued a voluntary evacuation for portions of four counties and one entire county by around before landfall mandatory evacuations were ordered for eight counties all of which but one were for the entire counties all coastal counties from cape fear northward were under a mandatory evacuation a survey of 603 residents in northeastern north carolina indicated 57% of residents along the outer banks and 77% of residents in storm surge prone areas of the pamlico sound did not evacuate despite being under a mandatory evacuation the two primary reasons stated for the residents evacuation decisions were the strength and track the media and statements from officials were two other reasons 70% of people along the outer banks heard the official evacuation notices though only 30% of residents near the pamlico sound heard the notices a majority of the respondents to the survey who heard the evacuation notices left the area none of the surveyed evacuees from the outer banks went to a public shelter 60% went to a friend or a house and 24% went to a motel evacuees on the outer banks generally went elsewhere in north carolina or to virginia for evacuees around the pamlico sound only 9% left for a public shelter while 75% left for a friend or house most near the pamlico sound remained in their own neighborhood or own county of the 19 north carolina counties issuing evacuation orders the duration of the evacuation process varied between to in dare county five counties reported heavy amounts of traffic while traffic problems included stalled cars along roads inadequate route signing and flooded or damaged roads 5 by the morning of the landfall 65 shelters were prepared with a capacity of the american red cross prepared 100 feeding vehicles in staging areas and deployed two mobile kitchens each with the capacity to provide 10,000 meals per day additionally five southern baptist convention kitchens were on standby in total being able to provide 20,000 meals per day 6 impact edit storm tides hurricane isabel produced hurricane force wind gusts throughout eastern north carolina the winds downed hundreds of trees leaving up to 700,000 without power across the state 4 damage from the hurricane totaled about 7 three people were killed in the state a utility worker attempting to restore electricity and two by falling trees 8 outer banks edit damage to the barrier islands after hurricane isabel usgs hurricane isabel first began affecting north carolina about before it struck land upon making landfall along the outer banks the hurricane produced strong waves of 15 to 4.5 to in height and a storm surge of about 6 to 1.8 to 4 waters reached a height of 7.15 feet in hatteras 9 storm tides along the coast peaked at in cape hatteras though the total could be higher there due to the tide gauge being destroyed by the hurricane 4 the surge and waves created a new inlet by washing out a portion of hatteras island between hatteras and frisco unofficially named isabel inlet the break was wide and deep and consisted of three distinct channels the formation of the inlet destroyed a portion of north carolina highway 12 10 and also washed out three homes 4 dunes power lines and utility pipes 11 the new inlet destroyed all utility connections to hatteras village isolating the residents there the storm surge and waves from isabel also resulted in a breach between hatteras and hatteras inlet the breach which nearly became an inlet formed from the flow of ocean water across the island though it was not deep enough for a constant water flow the breach occurred in an area without roads or houses and had little impact on hatteras residents 11 rough surf and storm surge caused overwash and severe beach erosion throughout the outer banks with flooding in ocracoke reportedly being up to waist high 12 the hurricane produced an estimated of rain throughout most of the outer banks with duck reporting a peak of wind gusts in association with the hurricane peaked at in ocracoke with several other locations reporting hurricane force gusts 12 wind and water damage across the outer banks was extensive strong waves and the storm surge from hurricane isabel knocked about 30 to 40 houses and several motels off of their pilings 12 two families who did not evacuate were nearly swept out to sea when their home was destroyed local rescue was unable to reach them however they were ultimately able to reach safety 4 the rough waves greatly affected piers in nags head rodanthe and frisco with three being completely destroyed several locations along north carolina highway 12 were partially washed out or covered with debris and sections of pavement on both sides of a bridge near ocracoke were washed away strong waves destroyed a beach access ramp as well 12 several thousand homes and businesses were damaged by the passage of the hurricane and damage in dare county totalled nearly in the outer banks no deaths or injuries were reported 7 southeast north carolina edit destroyed house on the outer banks the effects of hurricane isabel were generally light in the southeastern portion of the state sustained winds reached offshore in the frying pan shoals where a gust of was also reported sustained winds were lighter along the coast peaking at at the wilmington international airport while gusts reached at a north carolina state ports authority facility in wilmington tropical storm force wind gusts were reported as far inland as lumberton where gusts reached the large circulation of isabel dropped moderate rainfall across the area peaking at in whiteville additionally weather radars estimated over of precipitation fell in portions of new hanover county the rainfall resulted in ponding on roadways though no severe flooding was reported storm tides were generally around above normal 13 though wilmington reported a storm tide of 4 rough waves resulted in moderate beach erosion near cape fear and minor erosion along eastward facing beaches north of cape fear 13 damage was minor in southeast north carolina moderate winds inflicted isolated shingle and siding damage along barrier islands the winds downed several trees some onto cars and houses brief power outages were also reported 13 beach erosion damaged a bridge in bald head island as well 14 in chowan county a business parking lot was under several feet of water due to flash flooding 15 one person was indirectly killed in

up to in havelock upon making landfall isabel produced moderate to severe storm surges along the pamlico and neuse rivers with a location in craven county reporting a storm tide of above normal 12 the strong storm surge produced significant flooding in harlowe and oriental several other locations also reported flooding of streets and low lying areas the rise of water flooded many homes in craven county and the eastern portions of carteret and pamlico counties 12 emergency personnel performed many rescues to people who had not evacuated and had become trapped by storm surge flooding several eyewitnesses reported high velocity waist deep water moving homes trailers and other objects many yards inland as the water retreated these objects were then dragged back towards the sound a 5 to 1.5 to storm surge struck the western portion of the albemarle sound with significant surge flooding occurring to the west of edenton there the surge destroyed four homes two of which were moved up to 20 feet off their concrete block foundations nearly 60 percent of all homes and business in chowan county suffered some structural damage due to wind many of which were the result of large falling trees one female died when a tree fell on her vehicle in chowan county 4 aftermath edit hundreds of residents were stranded in hatteras following the formation of the new inlet created by rising waters many parts of north carolina highway 12 were partially washed or damaged which slowed recovery efforts and the return of homeowners in the outer banks 8 sections of the highway were closed to one lane the ferry between hatteras island and ocracoke island was temporarily closed due to damage after the hurricane though a small passenger ferry remained available for hatteras village residents and emergency workers people who were not residents were not allowed to be on the outer banks for two weeks after the hurricane due to damaged road conditions when visitors were allowed to return many ventured to see the new inlet despite a 1 mile walk from the nearest road 11 initially long term solutions to the isabel inlet such as building a bridge or a ferry system were considered though they were ultimately cancelled in favor of pumping sand and filling the inlet coastal geologists were opposed to the solution stating the evolution of the outer banks is dependent on inlets from hurricanes 10 dredging operations began on october 17 about a month after the hurricane struck the united states geological survey used sand from the ferry channel to the southwest of hatteras island a choice made to minimize impact to submerged aquatic vegetation and due to the channel being filled somewhat during the hurricane 16 on november 22 about two months after the hurricane struck highway 12 and hatteras island were reopened to public access on the same day the ferry between hatteras and ocracoke was reopened the breach on the southern end of hatteras island was filled in with sand as well 11 hardware stores experienced great demand for portable generators chain saws dehumidifiers and air movers following the passage of the hurricane utility crews from across the country came to the state to assist in returning power 8 though power outages persisted for several days 11 over 2,500 utility members worked in some cases around the clock to restore the power one power company restored power to 68% of its affected customers by the day after isabel passed through the area 17 by four days after landfall 83,000 customers were without power down from its peak of several hundred thousand 18 counties declared as disaster areas hours after isabel made landfall president george w bush issued a major disaster declaration for 26 north carolina counties which allowed the use of federal personnel equipment and lifesaving systems and the delivery of heavy duty generators plastic sheeting tents cots food water medical aid and other essential supplies and materials for sustaining human life the declaration also allocated federal funds for the long term recovery of hurricane stricken residents and business owners as well as providing federal funds for the state and local governments to pay 75 percent of the eligible cost for debris removal and emergency services related to the hurricane including requested emergency work undertaken by the federal government 19 by four days after the emergency declaration assistance checks were mailed and used by residents to pay for what was not covered by their insurance 18 by four days after landfall fema served around 68,000 meals to displaced families more than a dozen disaster recovery centers were initiated throughout the state fema provided 125,000 pounds of ice in the first few days and prepared 200,000 pounds of ice and of water for the following week 18 for the remaining communities without water by six days after isabel struck the state all hospitals were opened and all roads excluding north carolina highway 12 were passable due to emergency crews clearing roads with debris 20 by about one month after the hurricane struck 32,560 north carolina residents applied for federal assistance with disaster aid totaling
