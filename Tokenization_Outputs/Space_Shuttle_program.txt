endeavour in orbit 2002 patch the space shuttle program was the united states manned launch vehicle program administered by nasa from 1972 to 2011 and first flown in 1981 its official name space transportation system sts was taken from a 1969 plan for a system of reusable spacecraft of which it was the only item funded for development 1 the space shuttle of an orbiter launched with two reusable solid rocket boosters and a disposable external fuel tank up to eight astronauts and up to of payload into low earth orbit leo when its mission was complete the orbiter would re enter the earth s atmosphere and land like a glider at either the kennedy space center or edwards air force base the shuttle is the only winged manned spacecraft to have achieved orbit and landing and the only reusable manned space vehicle that has ever made multiple flights into orbit the russian shuttle buran was very similar and was designed to have the same capabilities but made only one unmanned spaceflight before it was cancelled its missions involved carrying large payloads to various orbits including segments to be added to the international space station iss providing crew rotation for the space station and performing service missions the orbiter also recovered satellites and other payloads e g from the iss from orbit and returned them to earth though its use in this capacity was rare each vehicle was designed with a projected lifespan of 100 launches or 10 years operational life though original selling points on the shuttles were over 150 launches and over a 15 year operational span with a launch per month expected at the peak of the program but extensive delays in the development of the international space station 2 never created such a peak demand for frequent flights although the concept had been explored since the late 1960s the program formally commenced in 1972 and was the sole focus of manned operations after the final apollo and skylab flights in the mid 1970s the shuttle was originally conceived of and presented to the public in 1972 as a space truck which would among other things be used to build a united states space station in low earth orbit during the 1980s and then be replaced by a new vehicle by the early 1990s the stalled plans for a u s space station evolved into the international space station and were formally initiated in 1983 by u s president ronald reagan but the iss suffered from long delays design changes and cost over runs 2 and forced the service life of the space shuttle to be extended several times until 2011 when it was finally retired serving twice as long than it was originally designed to do in 2004 according to the president george w vision for space exploration use of the space shuttle was to be focused almost exclusively on completing assembly of the iss which was far behind schedule at that point the first experimental orbiter enterprise was a high altitude glider launched from the back of a specially modified boeing 747 only for initial atmospheric landing tests alt enterprise s first test flight was on february 18 1977 only five years after the shuttle program was formally initiated leading to the launch of the first space worthy shuttle columbia on april 12 1981 on sts 1 the space shuttle program finished with its last mission sts 135 flown by atlantis in july 2011 retiring the final shuttle in the fleet the space shuttle program formally ended on august 31 2011 3 since the retirement many of its original duties are performed by an assortment of government and private

nasa administrator address the crowd at the spacelab arrival ceremony in february 1982 on the podium with him is then vice president george bush the director general of european space agency esa eric quistgaard and director of kennedy space center richard g smith before the apollo 11 moon landing in 1969 nasa began early studies of space shuttle designs in 1969 president richard nixon formed the space task group chaired by vice president spiro t agnew this group outlined ambitious post apollo missions centered on a large permanently manned space station a small reusable logistics vehicle that would support it and ultimately a manned mission to mars smaller goals included a variety of space vehicles for moving spacecraft around in orbit 4 presenting the plans to nixon agnew was told that the administration would not commit to a mars mission and limited activity to low earth orbit for the immediate future 5 he was then told to select one of the two remaining proposals after some debate between the station and the vehicle the vehicle was chosen suitably designed such a spacecraft could perform some longer duration missions and thus fill some of the goals of the station and over the longer run could help lower the cost of access to space and make the station less expensive 4 the goal as presented by nasa to congress was to provide a much less expensive means of access to space that would be used by nasa the department of defense and other commercial and scientific users 6 during early shuttle development there was great debate about the optimal shuttle design that best balanced capability development cost and operating cost ultimately the current design was chosen using a reusable winged orbiter reusable solid rocket boosters and an expendable external fuel tank for the main engines 4 the shuttle program was formally launched on january 5 1972 when president nixon announced that nasa would proceed with the development of a reusable space shuttle system 4 the stated goals of transforming the space frontier into familiar territory easily accessible for human endeavor 7 was to be achieved by launching as many as 50 missions per year with hopes of driving down per mission costs 8 the prime contractor for the program was north american rockwell later rockwell international now boeing the same company responsible for building the apollo command service module the contractor for the space shuttle solid rocket boosters was morton thiokol now part of alliant techsystems for the external tank martin marietta now lockheed martin and for the space shuttle main engines rocketdyne now pratt whitney rocketdyne part of united technologies 4 the first orbiter was originally planned to be named constitution but a massive write in campaign from fans of the star trek television series convinced the white house to change the name to enterprise 9 amid great fanfare enterprise designated ov 101 was rolled out on september 17 1976 and later conducted a successful series of glide approach and landing tests in 1977 that were the first real validation of the design 10 early u s space shuttle concepts sts 1 at liftoff the external tank was painted white for the first two space shuttle launches from sts 3 on it was left unpainted citation needed the first two missions had tanks painted white this elimination saved some weight about 600 lbs 272 kg 11 decades later some questioned if the paint might have prevented the ice soaked foam shedding issue that lead to the destruction of columbia 11 it was hope the shuttle might be able to rejuvenate

during sts 31 in the course of 135 missions flown two orbiters columbia and challenger suffered catastrophic accidents with the loss of all crew members totaling 14 astronauts the accidents led to national level inquiries and detailed analysis of why the accidents occurred 11 there was a significant pause where changes were made before the shuttles returned to flight 11 the columbia disaster occurred in 2003 but sts took more than a year off before returning to flight in june 2005 with the sts 114 mission 11 the previous break was between january 1986 when the challenger disaster occurred

km h 17000 mph and achieve orbit a drag chute is deployed by endeavour as it completes a mission of almost 17 days in space on runway 22 at edwards air force base in southern california landing occurred at est march 18 1995 early during development of the space shuttle nasa had estimated that the program would cost in 2011 dollars adjusting for inflation in development non recurring costs and 9 3m 54m in 2011 dollars per flight 17 early estimates for the cost to deliver payload to low earth orbit were as low as $118 per pound 260 kg of payload 635 lb or 1 400 kg in 2011 dollars based on marginal or incremental launch costs and assuming a 65,000 pound payload capacity and 50 launches per year 18 19 a more realistic projection of 12 flights per year for the 15 year service life combined with the initial development costs would have resulted in a total cost projection for the program of roughly in 2011 dollars the total cost of the actual 30 year service life of the shuttle program through 2011 adjusted for inflation was 8 the exact breakdown into non recurring and recurring costs is not available but according to nasa the average cost to launch a space shuttle as of 2011 was about per mission 20 budget for 2005 allocated 30 or to space shuttle operations 21 this was decreased in 2006 to a request of 22 non launch costs account for a significant part of the program budget for example during fiscal years 2004 to 2006 nasa spent around $13 billion on the space shuttle program 23 even though the fleet was grounded in the aftermath of the columbia disaster and there were a total of three launches during this period of time in fiscal year 2009 nasa budget allocated for 5 launches to the program including for program integration for flight and ground operations and for flight hardware which includes maintenance of orbiters engines and the external tank between flights per launch costs can be measured by dividing the total cost over the life of the program including buildings facilities training salaries etc by the number of launches with 135 missions and the total cost of in 2010 dollars this gives approximately per launch over the life of the program 24 accidents edit in 1986 challenger disintegrated one minute and 13 seconds after liftoff play media video of columbia s final moments filmed by the crew space shuttle discovery as it approaches the international space station during sts 114 on july 28 2005 this was the return to flight mission after the columbia disaster in the course of 135 missions flown two orbiters were destroyed with loss of crew totalling 14 astronauts challenger lost 73 seconds after liftoff sts 51 l january 28 1986 columbia lost approximately 16 minutes before its expected landing sts 107 february 1 2003 close up video footage of challenger during its final launch on january 28 1986 clearly show it began due to an o ring failure on the right solid rocket booster srb the hot plume of gas leaking from the failed joint caused the collapse of the external tank which then resulted in the disintegration due to high aerodynamic stress the accident resulted in the loss of all seven astronauts on board endeavour ov 105 was built to replace challenger using structural spare parts originally intended for the other orbiters and delivered in may 1991 it was first launched a year later after the loss of challenger nasa grounded the shuttle program for over two years making numerous safety changes recommended by the rogers commission report which included a redesign of the srb joint that failed in the challenger accident other safety changes included a new escape system for use when the orbiter was in controlled flight improved landing gear tires and brakes and the reintroduction of pressure suits for shuttle astronauts these had been discontinued after sts 4 astronauts wore only coveralls and oxygen helmets from that point on until the challenger accident the shuttle program continued in september 1988 with the launch of discovery on sts 26 the shuttle program operated accident free for seventeen years after the challenger disaster until columbia broke up on re entry killing all seven crew members on february 1 2003 the accident began when a piece of foam shed from the external tank struck the leading edge of the left wing puncturing one of the reinforced carbon carbon rcc panels that covered the wing edge and protected it during re entry as columbia re entered the atmosphere hot gas penetrated the wing and destroyed it from the inside out causing the orbiter to lose control and disintegrate nasa maintains warehoused extensive catalogs of recovered pieces from the two destroyed orbiters the accidents did not just affect the technical design of the orbiter but also nasa 15 quoting some recommendations made by the post challenger rogers commission 15 recommendation i the faulty solid rocket motor joint and seal must be changed this could be a new design eliminating the joint or a redesign of the current joint and seal the administrator of nasa should request the national research council to form an independent solid rocket motor design oversight committee to implement the design recommendations and oversee the design effort recommendation ii the shuttle program structure should be reviewed nasa should encourage the transition of qualified astronauts into agency management positions recommendation iii nasa and the primary shuttle contractors should review all criticality 1 1r 2 and 2r items and hazard analyses recommendation iv nasa should establish an office of safety reliability and quality assurance to be headed by an associate administrator reporting directly to the nasa administrator recommendation vi nasa must take actions to improve landing safety the tire brake and nosewheel system must be improved recommendation vii make all efforts to provide a crew escape system for use during controlled gliding flight recommendation viii the reliance on the shuttle as its principal space launch capability created a relentless pressure on nasa to increase the flight rate nasa must establish a flight rate that is consistent with its resources after the columbia disaster the international space station operated on a skeleton crew of two for more than two years and was serviced primarily by russian spacecraft while the return to flight mission sts 114 in 2005 was successful a similar piece of foam from a different portion of the tank was shed although the debris did not strike discovery the program was grounded once again for this reason the second return to flight mission sts 121 launched on july 4 2006 at 14 37 edt two previous launches were scrubbed because of lingering thunderstorms and high winds around the launch pad and the launch took place despite objections from its chief engineer and safety head a five inch crack in the foam insulation of the external tank gave cause for concern however the mission management team gave the go for launch 25 this mission increased the iss crew to three discovery touched down successfully on july 17 2006 at 09 14 edt on runway 15 at kennedy space center following the success of sts 121 all subsequent missions were completed without major foam problems and the construction of iss was completed during the sts 118 mission in august 2007 the orbiter was again struck by a foam fragment on liftoff but this damage was minimal compared to the damage sustained by columbia the columbia accident investigation board in its report noted the reduced risk to the crew when a shuttle flew to the international space station iss as the station could be used as a safe haven for the crew awaiting rescue in the event that damage to the orbiter on ascent made it unsafe for re entry the board recommended that for the remaining flights the shuttle always orbit with the station prior to sts 114 nasa administrator sean declared that all future flights of the shuttle would go to the iss precluding the possibility of executing the final hubble space telescope servicing mission which had been scheduled before the columbia accident despite the fact that millions of dollars worth of upgrade equipment for hubble were ready and waiting in nasa warehouses many dissenters including astronauts who asked nasa management to reconsider allowing the mission but initially the director stood firm on october 31 2006 nasa announced approval of the launch of atlantis for the fifth and final shuttle servicing mission to the hubble space telescope scheduled for august 28 2008 however sm4 sts 125 eventually launched in may 2009 one impact of columbia was that one the future launch vehicles planned to go into operation after the shuttle program was concluded was that ares i had a special emphasis on crew safety compared to other considerations 26 further information space shuttle challenger disaster and space shuttle columbia disaster retirement edit atlantis begins the last mission of the space shuttle program main article space shuttle retirement the space shuttle program was extended several times beyond its originally envisioned 15 year life span because of the delays in building the united states space station in low earth orbit a project which eventually evolved into the international space station it was formally scheduled for mandatory retirement in 2010 in accord with the directives president george w bush issued on january 14 2004 in his vision for space exploration 27 spending provision allowing nasa to fly the space shuttle beyond its then scheduled retirement in 2010 passed the congress in april 2009 although neither nasa nor the white house requested the one year extension 28 the final space shuttle launch was that of atlantis on july 8 2011 although the retirement was planned and roughly in line with what was expected out of sts without further upgrades the planned replacement for the sts the constellation program was cancelled the year before sts concluded the two programs that took its place two undetermined commercial crew vehicles and sls with orion needed even more time to
