affected peninsula western cuba florida panhandle georgia north carolina virginia maryland pennsylvania new york part of the 1972 atlantic hurricane season hurricane agnes was at the time the costliest hurricane to hit the united states in recorded history the second tropical cyclone and first named storm of the 1972 atlantic hurricane season agnes developed on from the interaction of a polar front and an upper trough over the peninsula initially forming as a tropical depression the storm headed slowly eastward and emerged into the western caribbean sea on once in the caribbean the depression began to strengthen and by the following day it became tropical storm agnes thereafter agnes slowly curved northward and passed just west of cuba on early on the storm intensified enough to be upgraded to hurricane agnes heading northward the hurricane eventually made landfall near panama city florida late on after moving inland agnes rapidly weakened and was only a tropical depression when it entered georgia the weakening trend halted as the storm crossed over georgia and into south carolina while over eastern north carolina agnes re strengthened into a tropical storm on as a result of baroclinic activity early the following day the storm emerged into the atlantic ocean before re curving northwestward and making landfall near new york city as a strong tropical storm agnes quickly became an extratropical cyclone on and tracked to the northwest of great britain before becoming absorbed by another cyclone on though it moved slowly across the peninsula damage in mexico is unknown although the storm bypassed the tip of cuba heavy rainfall occurred killing seven people in florida agnes caused a significant tornado outbreak with at least twisters two of which were spawned in georgia the tornadoes and two initially unconfirmed tornadoes in florida alone resulted in over in damage and six fatalities at least in florida suffered either major damage or were destroyed other dwellings experienced minor losses though agnes made landfall as a hurricane no hurricane force winds were reported along the coast abnormally high tides resulted in extensive damage especially between apalachicola and cedar key light to moderate rainfall was reported in florida though no significant flooding occurred in georgia damage was limited to two tornadoes which caused approximately $275,000 in losses minimal effects were also recorded in alabama connecticut delaware rhode island south carolina and tennessee though one fatality was reported in delaware the most significant effects by far occurred in pennsylvania mostly due to intense flooding the hurricane severely flooded the susquehanna river and the lackawanna river causing major damage to the wilkes barre scranton metropolitan area in both pennsylvania and new jersey combined about 43,594 structures were either destroyed or significantly damaged in canada a mobile home was toppled killing two people overall

estimated that a tropical depression developed by on while centered over the peninsula about 78 miles southeast of 3 the depression tracked eastward and entered the western caribbean sea on 2 operationally the national hurricane center did not initiate advisories on the depression until on 4 early on at the depression strengthened into tropical storm agnes 3 however the depression was not operationally upgraded until sixteen hours later 5 after becoming a tropical storm on agnes slowly curved northward and approached the channel 3 late on it was noted that projected path indicated the possibly of landfall in western cuba 6 however the storm remained offshore though it closely brushed the western tip of cuba at on agnes intensified into a hurricane while in the southeastern gulf of mexico 3 prematurely the national hurricane center operationally upgraded agnes to a hurricane at on that day 7 upon becoming a hurricane agnes attained its maximum sustained winds of though it had not reached its minimum atmospheric pressure due to unfavorable conditions agnes leveled off slightly in intensity and weakened to a minimal hurricane while approaching the gulf coast of the united states 2 shortly before on agnes made landfall near cape san blas florida with winds of 8 remnants of agnes over northeastern united states at on only a few hours after moving inland agnes weakened to a tropical storm after crossing the florida alabama georgia stateline agnes rapidly weakened to a tropical depression while over georgia the depression curved northeastward and eventually to the east northeast after entering south carolina 2 though the storm had not dissipated the national hurricane center issued its final bulletin on agnes at on 9 by early on a large extratropical trough spawned a low pressure area which resulted in baroclinic activity as a result agnes restrengthened into a tropical storm at on while centered over eastern north carolina 2 three hours later the national hurricane center noted decreasing atmospheric pressures and indicated that winds had reached gale force winds and once again upgraded agnes to a tropical storm 10 by early on agnes emerged into the northwestern atlantic ocean where it continued to re intensify at agnes reached its minimum atmospheric pressure of as reported by a reconnaissance aircraft however maximum sustained winds were at only 2 3 late on agnes made its final landfall on long beach new york on long island with winds of 11 agnes began its long life as an extratropical cyclone once cold air invaded its circulation late on the system looped across south central pennsylvania on and then looped across southern ontario on it spawned a tornado in maniwaki ontario early that day which killed two and injured the cyclone sped east northeast reaching cape breton on before intensifying as it re entered the north atlantic after moving as far north as the while crossing the west on the morning of agnes turned southeastward its central pressure bottomed out near 980 millibars towards 0000 utc on between and the long lived system looped between ireland and iceland while weakening once more the system turned northeast strengthening one more time while accelerating across the hebrides on through 5 a stronger system moving in from the west finally absorbed agnes on while finally located to the southeast of iceland 12 preparations edit by on the national weather service issued gale warnings and a hurricane watch for the straits of florida and the florida keys from key west to dry tortugas 13 on the following day at another hurricane watch was put into effective from cedar key to pensacola in addition the gale warnings in the florida keys were extended to include areas from fort myers beach to clearwater 14 at on a hurricane warning became effective from st marks to panama city 15 the gale warnings which were in effect for the florida keys and fort myers beach to clearwater was discontinued at on 16 it is likely that the hurricane warning was discontinued after the national hurricane center downgraded agnes to a tropical storm at on 8 two hours later all gale warnings along the west

river crested the water came within feet of overtopping the dam as the normal flood control devices seemed unable to cope engineers had placed charges to blow out a section of the dam to prevent a catastrophic failure pennsylvania edit in pennsylvania heavy rainfall was reported with much of the state experiencing more than 7 inches of precipitation furthermore a large swath of rainfall exceeding 10 inches was reported in the central part of the state overall the rains peaked at 19 inches in the western portions of schuylkill county 19 as a result agnes is listed as the wettest tropical cyclone on record for the state of pennsylvania overall more than were forced to leave their homes due to flooding some buildings were under 13 feet of water in harrisburg 39 at the mansion the first floor was submerged by flood waters hundreds were trapped in their homes in wilkes barre due to the overflowing susquehanna river at the historic cemetery in forty fort were washed away

airport crashed and exploded on the runway 42 new york edit olean elmira and corning as well as many other southern tier towns were severely flooded sections of the former erie railroad main line between hornell and binghamton were damaged flooding in the upper allegheny river basin was particularly exacerbated by the construction of the kinzua dam less than a decade prior several towns in cattaraugus county suffered extensive road and bridge damage that four decades later has yet to be repaired with the state and local governments opting to abandon creek and river crossings instead of reconstruct them however said dam construction allegedly succeeded in preventing further damage downstream in pennsylvania and much of the flood prone areas in the allegheny reservoir region had already been cleared of residents in preparation for the construction in elmira porches and garages were ripped loose the walnut st bridge was carried away maple ave to notre dame high school was underwater and on s main st pharmacy at w hudson was engulfed by of water damage was minimal largely due to the protection of two dam systems installed after the devastating 1935 flood both the arkport and almond dams saved hornell from the level of damage found in neighboring communities three us army corp of engineers were killed in hornell when their helicopter came in contact with power lines over crosby creek the height of the floodwaters has been marked in the entrance to the corning museum of glass showing that much of the museum was under water to a height of about 1.6 m above

feet above normal at the indian river inlet high winds were also reported in the state and at the dover air force base a wind gust as high as was reported 2 rainfall was generally light peaking at 7.6 inches in middletown 43 street flooding was reported and basements in low lying area were flooded though damage in delaware was minimal 44 one fatality occurred in that state 2 in the washington d c area moderate rainfall was reported with precipitation amounts peaking at 13.65 inches at the washington dulles international airport 2 significant flooding occurred and it was described as the worst in at least in the georgetown section waterfront streets along the potomac river were submerged in as much as 7 feet of water 45 the rock creek also overflowed its banks which sent about 10 feet of

washington d c suffered minor damage 20 at the white house reporters noted wet carpets in the press room of the basement floor 39 though the storm passed just west of some areas in new england minimal impact in that region of the united states in connecticut winds were well below tropical storm force although a wind gust of was reported in hartford rainfall in the state was light peaking at 1.62 inches also recorded in hartford 2 along the coast of connecticut high tides and heavy rainfall flooded coastal roads and basements high tides occurred along the coastline of rhode island reaching 3.2 feet above normal in providence 2 in combination with rainfall and high tides some coastal roads were flooded strong winds felled trees and numerous limbs in massachusetts causing power outages and property damage in the western and central portions of the state one home in great barrington was struck by a tree a similar incident occurred in milford high winds in southern and eastern vermont knocked over trees and snapped off limbs which resulted in scattered power outages roads being blocked and minor property damage in mendon a tree fell on a house while two cars were damaged after being struck by limbs similar conditions occurred in new hampshire albeit effects were lesser 26 elsewhere edit as a precaution more than in western cuba including on isla de la juventud isle of pines were evacuated 46 in western cuba agnes dropped heavy rainfall peaking at 16.76 inches on isla de la juventud at cape san antonio the westernmost point in cuba precipitation reached 15.32 inches 2 due to high winds and flooding at least were destroyed and another damaged in the pinar del province the cities of guane and mantua were isolated by swollen rivers it was also reported that extensive crop damage occurred in low lying areas 46 overall seven fatalities occurred in cuba though the damage toll is unknown 47 however some sources claim agnes caused and reported missing 48 in canada hurricane agnes gave heavy rains and winds over southern ontario and southern quebec causing numerous floodings around lake erie and lake ontario in the town of maniwaki quebec the storm toppled a mobile home killing two people 49 aftermath edit following the storm then president of the united states richard nixon declared in florida as a disaster area including brevard county dixie county franklin county hendry county hillsborough county lee county levy county manatee county monroe county okeechobee county pasco county pinellas county sarasota county and wakulla county 50 in panama city florida where over evacuated effects were not significant as a result the city lost millions of dollars from tourism which led the officials of panama city to file a lawsuit against the national weather service officials in that city believed that the national weather service and other media outlets made exaggerated and erroneous forecasts and reports on the storm 51 were declared a disaster area following the storm then president of the united states richard nixon declared the states of florida virginia maryland pennsylvania and new york as disaster areas agnes had a devastating impact on the already bankrupt railroads in the northeastern united states as lines were washed out and shipments were delayed the erie lackawanna railway el estimated that damage between binghamton and salamanca new york amounted to $2 million el filed for chapter 77 bankruptcy the penn central railroad sustained nearly $20 million in damages the resulting cost of repairing the damage was one of the factors leading to the creation of the federally financed conrail citation needed the severe floods near lawrenceville pennsylvania were the catalyst for the construction of the tioga reservoir in 1973 the flooding in wilkes barre pennsylvania and the adjacent town of kingston led to the construction of a levee system that in 2006 successfully prevented massive flooding and in the same year was deemed very safe and protective by the army corps of engineers the levee also protected the area from the remnants of tropical storm lee and hurricane irene in 2011 with the water cresting just barely below the height of the structure conversely the existing kinzua dam built against the wishes of the seneca nation of new york spared much of western pennsylvania from the worst flooding by filling the allegheny reservoir to capacity retirement edit see also list of retired atlantic hurricane names because of extensive damage and severe death tolls the name agnes was retired following this storm and will
