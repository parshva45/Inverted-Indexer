adapter 2 pma 2 was attached where destiny would be and pma 2 was moved from unity node to a temporary position on the truss 5 destiny was berthed to that hatch on unity while pma 2 was moved to the forward hatch of the z1 truss after that it was moved to the forward hatch of destiny during that mission 6 see also pressurized mating adapter and z1 truss several years later on november 14 2007 harmony module was attached to the forward end of the destiny laboratory 7 the addition of destiny increased the habitable volume by 3,800 cubic feet and increased onboard living space by 41 percent 5 destiny heads to the launch pad aboard crawler the shuttle crew heading out for the launch liftoff astronaut on eva with destiny the newly expanded iss with destiny laboratory february 2001 laboratory structure edit the destiny laboratory as it looked following installation in 2001 interior view of the us lab with the lights turned off i e while the crew sleeps the aluminium u s laboratory module is 28 feet long and 14 feet wide 2 3 it comprises three cylindrical sections and two endcones that contain the hatch openings through which astronauts enter and exit the module 2 the aft port of destiny is connected to the forward port of node 1 and the forward port of destiny is connected to the aft port of node 2 the ends are colored blue and white respectively for the crew to navigate easily 7 8 a 20 inch window is located on one side of the center module segment 3 each of the two berthing ports on destiny contains a hatch 3 both hatches are normally open and remain open unless a situation arises requiring a module to be isolated each hatch has a window the hatches can be opened or closed from either side the hatches have a pressure interlock feature which prevents the hatch from being opened if there is a negative pressure across the hatch higher pressure on the outside of the hatch the hatch openings are a square like six sided shape which is associated to that module destiny has a 20 inch optically pure telescope quality glass window located in an open rack bay used primarily for earth science observations 2 3 9 station crewmembers use very high quality video and still cameras at the window to record changing landscapes a window shutter protects the window from potential micrometeoroid and orbital debris strikes during the life of the iss the crew manually opens the shutter to use the window imagery captured from window has given geologists and meteorologists the chance to study floods avalanches fires and ocean events such as plankton blooms in a way never seen before as well as given international scientists the opportunity to study features such as glaciers coral reefs urban growth and wild fires 3 specifications edit joan e higginbotham and sunita l williams work the controls of the space station remote manipulator system in the destiny laboratory length 8.53 metres diameter 4.27 metres mass 14,520 kilograms pressurized volume 106 cubic metres equipment edit sts 122 mission specialists working on robotic equipment in the us lab destiny arrived at the station pre configured with five racks housing electrical and life support systems that provide electrical power cooling water air revitalization and temperature and humidity control seven additional racks were flown to destiny in the leonardo multi purpose logistics module by sts 102 and ten more were delivered on subsequent missions destiny can hold up to 13 payload racks with experiments in human life science materials research earth observations and commercial applications 3 the laboratory has a total of 24 racks inside the laboratory six on each side 2 as with the european and japanese laboratories of the station payloads inside destiny are configured around international standard payload racks isprs that can be removed or reconfigured for various experiments and equipment 9 made out of a graphite composite shell each rack weighs about 1,200 pounds and is about 73 inches high and 42 inches wide 9 the eight rack bays are equipped with curtains that provide around 290 cubic feet 3 of temporary stowage space when not occupied by experiments 9 internal to the laboratory are racks rack stand offs and vestibule jumpers 10 the lab racks house the system hardware in removable modular units the stand offs provide space for electrical connections data management systems cabling for computers air conditioning ducts thermal control tubes and more all of which support the space equipment racks 10 the racks interface to the piping and wiring in the standoff via outlets and ports located in the standoffs at the base end of each rack location jumpers in the vestibule the area between unity and destiny connect the piping and wiring between the two grounding straps between unity and destiny will be installed one side of the grounding strap will be connected to the active common berthing mechanism acbm on unity while the other end will be connected to the passive common berthing mechanism pcbm on destiny some of the mechanisms on destiny are the cbms passive and active hatches and the laboratory window shutter the acbm is in the forward port of the laboratory it is attached to the harmony node 8 the pcbm on destiny is located in the aft port the acbm in forward port is latched to the pcbm to berth destiny to unity science equipment edit destiny also contains the minus eighty degree laboratory freezer for iss melfi transported to the space station on sts 121 11 the freezer is used both to store samples and reagents on the station and to transport them to and from the space station in a temperature controlled environment 12 currently installed at the main observation window of destiny is the agricultural camera agcam it is a multi spectral imaging system built and primarily operated by students and faculty at the university of north dakota its purpose is to take frequent images in visible and infrared light of vegetated areas on the earth and promises to deliver a greater effectiveness for in season agriculture applications research and operational decision support than current satellite systems such as landsat 13 veggie edit in 2016 the iss crew operated veg 03 experiment 14 in november they harvested a crop of edible romaine lettuce which contributed to the meal 15 also samples of cabbage are returned to earth for testing as part of the experiment 14 this uses the veggie experiment module in destiny which can provide light and nutrients for plant growth experiments 15 destiny nadir window edit the nadir window is formally known as the u s laboratory science window has the highest quality optics ever flown on a human occupied spacecraft according to nasa and can support taking earth observations images 16 in 2010 a research facility was brought to the station called worf and the first photo with it was taken in january 2011 17 worf was delivered by iss flight 19a which was sts 131 18 dutch esa astronaut andre kuipers looks out of the destiny nadir window at earth astronaut susan helms looks out the nadir window 2001 destiny nadir view with some iss crew peering out of the earth observation window the people are astronauts susan j helms and james s voss worf edit main article window observational research facility naoko yamazaki installing window observational research facility in 2010 the worf was brought to iss aboard sts 131 and installed 16 this is a facility that uses the destiny nadir window to support various types of photography and observation 16 worf which stands for window observational research facility is constructed based on international standard payload rack ispr and express rack program technology 16 16 the first photo taken by worf was on january 21 2011 with ag cam 16 the name worf was an allusion to a fictional character that appeared in science fiction television and movie universe known as star trek in a special mission patch for worf 19 the mission patch including text written in the klingon language of that character and the patch maker contacted the movie studio for permission and correctness 19 another cross over of the star trek franchise and space exploration was the naming of space shuttle enterprise future use edit after the retirement of the iss in 2024 the destiny lab will be used as a workstation and science platform of the future deep space habitat see also edit spaceflight portal after its installation habiation and use of destiny is similar to iss history as an integrated part of that space station
