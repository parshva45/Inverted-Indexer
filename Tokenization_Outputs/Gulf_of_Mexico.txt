golfo de is an ocean basin and a marginal sea of the atlantic ocean 1 largely surrounded by the north american continent 2 it is bounded on the northeast north and northwest by the gulf coast of the united states on the southwest and south by mexico and on the southeast by cuba the u s states of texas louisiana mississippi alabama and florida border the gulf on the north which are often referred to as the third coast in comparison with the u s atlantic and pacific coasts or sometimes the south coast in juxtaposition to the great lakes region being the north coast one of the seven main areas is the gulf of mexico basin the gulf of mexico formed approximately 300 million years ago as a result of plate tectonics 3 the basin is roughly oval and is approximately 810 nautical miles wide and floored by sedimentary rocks and recent sediments it is connected to part of the atlantic ocean through the florida straits between the u s and cuba and with the caribbean with which it forms the american mediterranean sea via the channel between mexico and cuba with the narrow connection to the atlantic the gulf experiences very small tidal ranges the size of the gulf basin is approximately 1.6 million km 2 almost half of the basin is shallow continental shelf waters the basin contains a volume of roughly 2,500 quadrillion liters 550 quadrillion imperial gallons 660 quadrillion us

the gulf of mexico the consensus among geologists 3 6 7 who have studied the geology of the gulf of mexico is that prior to the late triassic the gulf of mexico did not exist before the late triassic the area now occupied by the gulf of mexico consisted of dry land which included continental crust that now underlies within the middle of the large supercontinent of pangea this land lay south of a continuous mountain range that extended from north central mexico through the marathon uplift in west texas and the ouachita mountains of oklahoma and to alabama where it linked directly to the appalachian mountains it was created by the collision of continental plates that formed pangea as interpreted by roy van arsdale and randel t cox this mountain range was breached in late cretaceous times by the formation of the mississippi embayment 8 9 geologists and other earth scientists agree in general that the present gulf of mexico basin originated in late triassic time as the result of rifting within pangea 10 the rifting was associated with zones of weakness within pangea including sutures where the laurentia south american and african plates collided to create it first there was a late triassic early jurassic phase of rifting during which rift valleys formed and filled with continental red beds second as rifting progressed through early and middle jurassic time continental crust was stretched and thinned this thinning created a broad zone of thick transitional crust which displays modest and uneven thinning with block faulting and a broad zone of uniformly thinned transitional crust which is half the typical thickness 35 kilometers of normal continental crust it was at this time that tectonics first created a connection to the pacific ocean across central mexico and later eastward to the atlantic ocean this flooded the subsiding basin created by rifting and crustal thinning to create the gulf of mexico while the gulf of mexico was a restricted basin the subsiding transitional crust was blanketed by the widespread deposition of louann salt and associated anhydrite evaporites initially during the late jurassic continued rifting widened the gulf of mexico and progressed to the point that sea floor spreading and formation of oceanic crust occurred at this point sufficient circulation with the atlantic ocean was established that the deposition of louann salt ceased 6 7 11 12 during the late jurassic through early cretaceous the basin occupied by the gulf of mexico experienced a period of cooling and subsidence of the crust underlying it the subsidence was the result of a combination of crustal stretching cooling and loading initially the combination of crustal stretching and cooling caused about of tectonic subsidence of the central thin transitional and oceanic crust because subsidence occurred faster than sediment could fill it the gulf of mexico expanded and deepened 6 12 13 later loading of the crust within the gulf of mexico and adjacent coastal plain by the accumulation of kilometers of sediments during the rest of the mesozoic and all of the cenozoic further depressed the underlying crust to its current position about below sea level particularly during the cenozoic thick clastic wedges built out the continental shelf along the northwestern and northern margins of the gulf of mexico 6 12 13 to the east the stable florida platform was not covered by the sea until the latest jurassic or the beginning of cretaceous time the platform was emergent until the mid cretaceous after both platforms were submerged the formation of carbonates and evaporites has characterized the geologic history of these two stable areas most of the basin was rimmed during the early cretaceous by carbonate platforms and its western flank was involved during the latest cretaceous and early paleogene periods in a compressive deformation episode the laramide orogeny which created the sierra madre oriental of eastern mexico 14 in 2002 geologist michael stanton published a speculative essay suggesting an impact origin for the gulf of mexico at the close of the permian which could have caused the extinction event 15 however gulf coast geologists do not regard this hypothesis as having any credibility instead they overwhelmingly accept plate tectonics not an asteroid impact as having created the gulf of mexico as illustrated by papers authored by kevin mickus and others 3 7 12 16 this hypothesis is not to be confused with the chicxulub crater a large impact crater on the coast of the gulf of mexico on the peninsula today the gulf of mexico has the following 7 main areas 14 gulf of mexico basin which contains the sigsbee deep and can be further divided into the continental rise the sigsbee abyssal plain and the mississippi cone northeast gulf of mexico which extends from a point east of the mississippi river delta near biloxi to the eastern side of apalachee bay south florida continental shelf and slope which extends along the coast from apalachee bay to the straits of florida and includes the florida keys and dry tortugas campeche bank which extends from the straits in the east to the tabasco campeche basin in the west and includes arrecife alacran bay of campeche which is an isthmian embayment extending from the western edge of campeche bank to the offshore regions just east of the port of veracruz western gulf of mexico which is located between veracruz to the south and the rio grande to the north northwest gulf of mexico which extends from alabama to the rio grande history edit

its path by up to 4 they had rebounded by the time of appearance although christopher columbus was credited with the discovery of the americas by europeans the ships in his four voyages never reached the gulf of mexico instead columbus sailed into the caribbean around cuba and hispaniola the first european exploration of the gulf of mexico was by amerigo vespucci in 1497 he followed the coastal land mass of central america before returning to the atlantic ocean via the straits of florida between florida and cuba in his letters vespucci described this trip and once juan de la cosa returned to spain a famous world map depicting cuba as an island was produced in 1506 took part in the conquest of hispaniola and cuba receiving a large estate of land and indian slaves for his effort in 1510 he accompanied diego de an aide of the governor of hispaniola in his expedition to conquer cuba in 1518 put him in command of an expedition to explore and secure the interior of mexico for colonization in 1517 francisco de discovered the peninsula this was the first european encounter with an advanced civilization in the americas with solidly built buildings and a complex social organization which they recognized as being comparable to those of the old world they also had reason to expect that this new land would have gold all of this encouraged two further expeditions the first in 1518 under the command of juan de grijalva and the second in 1519 under the command of which led to the spanish exploration military invasion and ultimately settlement and colonization known as the conquest of mexico did not live to see the continuation of his work he died in 1517 the year of his expedition as the result of the injuries and the extreme thirst suffered during the voyage and disappointed in the knowledge that diego had given precedence to grijalva as the captain of the next expedition to in 1523 de sailed toward mexico city but was shipwrecked en route along the coast of padre island texas in 1554 when word of the disaster reached mexico city the viceroy requested a rescue fleet and immediately sent marching overland to find the treasure laden vessels traveled to and hired a ship to transport him to the site which had already been visited from that community he arrived in time to greet de escalante alvarado a nephew of pedro de alvarado commander of the salvage operation when alvarado arrived by sea on july 22 1554 the team labored until september 12 to salvage the padre island treasure this loss in combination with other ship disasters around the gulf of mexico gave rise to a plan for establishing a settlement on the northern gulf coast to protect shipping and more quickly rescue castaways as a result the expedition of de luna y arellano was sent and landed at pensacola bay on august 15 1559 on december 11 1526 charles v granted de a license to claim what is now the gulf coast of the united states known as the expedition the contract gave him one year to gather an army leave spain be large enough to found at least two towns of 100 people each and garrison two more fortresses anywhere along the coast on april 7 1528 they spotted land north of what is now tampa bay they turned south and traveled for two days looking for a great harbor the master pilot miruelo knew of sometime during these two days one of the five remaining ships was lost on the rugged coast but nothing else is known of it in 1697 pierre le moyne sailed for france and was chosen by the minister of marine to lead an expedition to rediscover the mouth of the mississippi river and to colonize louisiana which the english coveted fleet sailed from brest on october 24 1698 on january 25 1699 iberville reached santa rosa island in front of pensacola founded by the spanish he sailed from there to mobile bay and explored massacre island later renamed dauphin island he cast anchor between cat island and ship island and on february 13 1699 he went to the mainland biloxi with his brother jean baptiste le moyne de bienville 17 on may 1 1699 he completed a fort on the north east side of the bay of biloxi a little to the rear of what is now ocean springs mississippi this fort was known as fort maurepas or old biloxi a few days later on may 4 pierre le moyne sailed for france leaving his teenage brother jean baptiste le moyne as second in command to the french commandant shipwrecks edit the mardi gras shipwreck around the early 19th century about 35 miles off the coast of louisiana in 4,000 feet 1220 meters of water she is believed to have been a privateer or trader the shipwreck whose real identity remains a mystery lay forgotten at the bottom of the sea until it was discovered in 2002 by an oilfield inspection crew working for the okeanos gas gathering company oggc in may 2007 an expedition led by texas a m university and funded by oggc under an agreement with the minerals management service now boem was launched to undertake the deepest scientific archaeological excavation ever attempted at that time to study the site on the seafloor and recover artifacts for eventual public display in the louisiana state museum as part of the project educational outreach nautilus productions in partnership with boem texas a m university the florida public archaeology network 18 and veolia environmental produced a one hour hd documentary 19 about the project short videos for public viewing and provided video updates during the expedition video footage from the rov was an integral part of this outreach and used extensively in the mystery mardi gras shipwreck documentary 20 on july 30 1942 the robert e lee captained by william c heath was torpedoed by the german submarine u 166 she was sailing southeast of the entrance to the mississippi river when the explosion destroyed the 3 hold vented through the b and c decks and damaged the engines the radio compartment and the steering gear after the attack she was under escort by the uss pc 566 captained by lcdr herbert g claudius en route to new orleans the uss pc 566 began dropping depth charges on a sonar contact sinking the u 166 the badly damaged robert e lee first listed to port then to starboard and finally sank within about 15 minutes of the attack one officer nine crewmen and 15 passengers were lost ironically the passengers aboard the robert e lee were primarily survivors of previous torpedo attacks by german u boats 21 the precise location was discovered during the c c marine survey that located the u 166 the german submarine u 166 was a type ixc u boat of nazi germany s kriegsmarine during world war ii the submarine was laid down on december 6 1940 at the seebeckwerft part of deutsche schiff und maschinenbau ag deschimag at modern bremerhaven as yard number 705 launched on november 1 1941 and commissioned on march 23 1942 under the command of oberleutnant zur see kuhlmann after training with the 4th u boat flotilla u 166 was transferred to the 10th u boat flotilla for front line service on june 1 1942 the u boat sailed on only two war patrols and sank four ships totalling 7,593 gross register 22 she was sunk on july 30 1942 in gulf of mexico 23 in 2001 the wreck of u 166 was located in 5,000 feet 1,500 m of water less than two miles from where it had attacked the robert e lee an archaeological survey of the seafloor prior to construction of a natural gas pipeline led to the discoveries by c c marine archaeologists robert a church and daniel j warren the sonar contacts consisted of two large sections lying approximately 500 feet apart at

gulf is bordered by cuba it supports major american mexican and cuban fishing industries the outer margins of the wide continental shelves of and florida receive cooler nutrient enriched waters from the deep by a process known as upwelling which stimulates plankton growth in the euphotic zone this attracts fish shrimp and squid 29 river drainage and atmospheric fallout from industrial coastal cities also provide nutrients to the coastal zone the gulf stream a warm atlantic ocean current and one of the strongest ocean currents known originates in the gulf as a continuation of the caribbean current current loop current system other circulation features include the anticyclonic gyres which are shed by the loop current and travel westward where they eventually dissipate and a permanent cyclonic gyre in the bay of campeche the bay of campeche in mexico constitutes a major arm of the gulf of mexico additionally the shoreline is fringed by numerous bays and smaller inlets a number of rivers empty into the gulf most notably the mississippi river and rio grande in the northern gulf and the grijalva and usumacinta rivers in the southern gulf the land that forms the coast including many long narrow barrier islands is almost uniformly low lying and is characterized by marshes and swamps as well as stretches of sandy beach the gulf of mexico is an excellent example of a passive margin the continental shelf is quite wide at most points along the coast most notably at the florida and peninsulas the shelf is exploited for its oil by means of offshore drilling rigs most of which are situated in the western gulf and in the bay of campeche another important commercial activity is fishing major catches include red snapper amberjack tilefish swordfish and various grouper as well as shrimp and crabs oysters are also harvested on a large scale from many of the bays and sounds other important industries along the coast include shipping petrochemical processing and storage military use paper manufacture and tourism the warm water temperature can feed powerful atlantic hurricanes causing extensive human death and other destruction as happened with hurricane katrina in 2005 in the atlantic a hurricane will draw up cool water from the depths and making it less likely that further hurricanes will follow in its wake warm water being one of the preconditions necessary for their formation however the gulf is shallower when a hurricane passes over the water temperature may drop but it soon rebounds and becomes capable of supporting another tropical storm 30 the gulf is considered aseismic however mild tremors have been recorded throughout history usually 5.0 or less on the richter magnitude scale earthquakes may be caused by interactions between sediment loading

oil drilling there are frequent red tide algae blooms 40 that kill fish and marine mammals and cause respiratory problems in humans and some domestic animals when the blooms reach close to shore this has especially been plaguing the southwest and southern florida coast from the florida keys to north of pasco county florida the gulf contains a hypoxic dead zone that runs east west along the texas louisiana coastline in july 2008 researchers reported that between 1985 and 2008 the area roughly doubled in size and now stretches from near galveston texas to near venice louisiana it is now about 8,000 square miles 2 nearly the record 41 poor agricultural practices in the northern portion of the gulf of mexico have led to a tremendous increase of nitrogen and phosphorus in neighboring marine ecosystems which has resulted in algae blooms and a lack of available oxygen occurrences of masculinization and estrogen suppression were observed as a result an october 2007 study of the atlantic croaker found a disproportioned sex ratio of 61% males to 39% females in hypoxic gulf sites this was compared with a 52% to 48% male female ratio found in reference sites showing an impairment of

platform located in the mississippi canyon about 40 miles off the louisiana coast suffered a catastrophic explosion it sank a day and a half later 44 it was in the process of being sealed with cement for temporary abandonment to avoid environmental problems 43 although initial reports indicated that relatively little oil had leaked by april 24 it was claimed by bp that approximately 1,000 barrels 3 of oil per day were issuing from the wellhead about 1 mile below the surface on the ocean floor 45 on april 29 the u s government revealed that approximately 5,000 barrels 3 per day five times the original estimate were pouring into the gulf from the wellhead 46 the resulting oil slick quickly expanded to cover hundreds of square miles of ocean surface posing a serious threat to marine life and adjacent coastal wetlands and to the livelihoods of gulf coast shrimpers and fishermen 47 coast guard rear adm sally brice stated that the u s government will be employing booms skimmers chemical
