can tie on to it tripping buoys used to keep one end of a tripping line on the surface so that a stuck anchor can more easily be freed weather buoys equipped to measure weather parameters such as air temperature barometric pressure wind speed and direction and to report these data via satellite radio links such as the purpose built argos system or commercial satellite phone networks to meteorological centres for use in forecasting and climate study may be anchored moored buoys or allowed to drift drifting buoys in the open ocean currents position is calculated by the satellite

fisherman has his or her own color markings or registration numbers so they know which ones are theirs they are only allowed to haul their own traps and must display their buoy color or license number on their boat so law enforcement officials know what they should be hauling the buoys are brightly colored with highly visible numbers so they can be seen under conditions when there is poor visibility like rain fog sea smoke etc 7 8 wave buoy used to measure the movement of the water surface as a wave train the wave train is analysed to determine statistics like the significant wave height and period and wave direction target buoy used to simulate target like small boat in live fire exercise by naval and coastal forces usually targeted by weapons medium size like rapid fire cannons 20 or so mm autocannons bigger ones up to 40 and 57mm and also anti tank rockets wreck buoy a buoy to mark a wrecked ship to warn other ships to keep away because of unseen hazards self

designed specifically for deployment from a u s coast guard vessel or airframe for search and rescue since the sldmb has a very small surface area above the ocean surface and a high underwater surface area there is very little leeway in response to the direct forcing of winds and waves 10 the space buoy is a common element in science fiction that refers to a stationary object in outer space that provides navigation data or warnings about that particular area buoy racing is the most prevalent form of yacht racing other uses edit the word buoyed can also be used figuratively for example a
