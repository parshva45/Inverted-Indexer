north atlantic oscillation wikipedia north atlantic oscillation from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search for the rock band see north atlantic oscillation band not to be confused with atlantic multidecadal oscillation the north atlantic oscillation nao is a weather phenomenon in the north atlantic ocean of fluctuations in the difference of atmospheric pressure at sea level slp between the icelandic low and the azores high through fluctuations in the strength of the icelandic low and the azores high it controls the strength and direction of westerly winds and location of storm tracks across the north atlantic 1 it is part of the arctic oscillation and varies over time with no particular periodicity citation needed the nao was discovered through several studies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries 2 unlike the el oscillation phenomenon in the pacific ocean the nao is a largely atmospheric mode it is one of the most important manifestations of climate fluctuations in the north atlantic and surrounding humid climates citation needed the north atlantic oscillation is closely related to the arctic oscillation ao or northern annular mode nam but should not be confused with the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo contents 1 definition 2 description 3 effects on north atlantic sea level 4 north atlantic hurricanes 5 ecological effects 6 winter of in europe 7 winter of in europe 8 see also 9 references 10 external links definition edit the nao has multiple possible definitions the easiest to understand are those based on measuring the seasonal average air pressure difference between stations such as lisbon and stykkisholmur ponta delgada azores and azores gibraltar and 3 these definitions all have in common the same northern point because this is the only station in the region with a long record in iceland and various southern points all are attempting to capture the same pattern of variation by choosing stations in the eye of the two stable pressure areas the azores high and the icelandic low shown in the graphic a more complex definition only possible with more complete modern records generated by numerical weather prediction is based on the principal empirical orthogonal function eof of surface pressure 3 this definition has a high degree of correlation with the station based definition this then leads onto a debate as to whether the nao is distinct from the ao nam and if not which of the two is to be considered the most physically based expression of atmospheric structure as opposed to the one that most clearly falls out of mathematical expression 4 5 description edit winter index of the nao based on the difference of normalized sea level pressure slp between lisbon portugal and stykkisholmur iceland since 1864 with a loess smoothing black westerly winds blowing across the atlantic bring moist air into europe in years when westerlies are strong summers are cool winters are mild and rain is frequent if westerlies are suppressed the temperature is more extreme in summer and winter leading to heat waves deep freezes and reduced rainfall 6 7 a permanent low pressure system over iceland the icelandic low and a permanent high pressure system over the azores the azores high control the direction and strength of westerly winds into europe the relative strengths and positions of these systems vary from year to year and this variation is known as the nao a large difference in the pressure at the two stations a high index year denoted nao leads to increased westerlies and consequently cool summers and mild and wet winters in central europe and its atlantic facade in contrast if the index is low nao westerlies are suppressed northern european areas suffer cold dry winters and storms track southwards toward the mediterranean sea this brings increased storm activity and rainfall to southern europe and north africa especially during the months of november to april the nao is responsible for much of the variability of weather in the north atlantic region affecting wind speed and wind direction changes changes in temperature and moisture distribution and the intensity number and track of storms research now suggests that the nao may be more predictable than previously assumed and skilful winter forecasts may be possible for the nao 8 although having a less direct influence than for western europe the nao is also believed to affect the weather over much of eastern north america during the winter when the index is high nao the icelandic low draws a stronger south westerly circulation over the eastern half of the north american continent which prevents arctic air from plunging southward in combination with the el this effect can produce significantly warmer winters over the northeastern united states and southeastern canada conversely when the nao index is low nao the eastern seaboard and southeastern united states can incur winter cold outbreaks more than the norm with associated heavy snowstorms in appalachia mid atlantic region and sub freezing conditions into florida another condition that occurs as result of nao is increased polar front activity plunging farther south than usual beyond the gulf of mexico caribbean sea basins resulting in a break in tropical weather for those regions as instance of this is when tehuantepecer winds blow outward into the pacific ocean away from the coastline of southern mexico in summer a strong nao is thought to contribute to a weakened jet stream that normally pulls zonal systems into the atlantic basin contributing significantly to excessively long lasting heat waves over europe effects on north atlantic sea level edit under a positive nao index nao regional reduction in atmospheric pressure results in a regional rise in sea level due to the inverse barometer effect this effect is important to both the interpretation of historic sea level records and predictions of future sea level trends as mean pressure fluctuations of the order of millibars can lead to sea level fluctuations of the order of centimeters north atlantic hurricanes edit see also pre 1600 atlantic hurricane seasons by controlling the position of the azores high the nao also influences the direction of general storm paths for major north atlantic tropical cyclones a position of the azores high farther to the south tends to force storms into the gulf of mexico whereas a northern position allows them to track up the north american atlantic coast 9 as paleotempestological research has shown few major hurricanes struck the gulf coast during bc and again during the most recent millennium these quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 bc and 1000 ad when the gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by times 10 11 12 ecological effects edit until recently the nao had been in an overall more positive regime since the late 1970s bringing colder conditions to the north west atlantic which has been linked with the thriving populations of labrador sea snow crabs which have a low temperature optimum 13 the nao warming of the north sea reduces survival of cod larvae which are at the upper limits of their temperature tolerance as does the cooling in the labrador sea where the cod larvae are at their lower temperature limits 13 though not the critical factor the nao peak in the early 1990s may have contributed to the collapse of the newfoundland cod fishery 13 on the east coast of the united states an nao causes warmer temperatures and increased rainfall and thus warmer less saline surface water this prevents nutrient rich upwelling which has reduced productivity georges bank and the gulf of maine are affected by this reduced cod catch 13 the strength of the nao is also a determinant in the population fluctuations of the intensively studied soay sheep 14 strangely enough jonas and joern 2007 found a strong signal between nao and grasshopper species composition in the tall grass prairies of the midwestern united states they found that even though nao does not significantly affect the weather in the midwest there was a significant increase in abundance of common grasshopper species i e hypochlora alba hesperotettix spp phoetaliotes nebrascensis m scudderi m keeleri and pseudopomala brachyptera following winters during the positive phase of nao and a significant increase in the abundance of less common species i e campylacantha olivacea melanoplus sanguinipes mermiria picta melanoplus packardii and boopedon gracile following winters during a negative phase of the nao this is thought to be the first study showing a link between nao and terrestrial insects in north america 15 winter of in europe edit the winter of in europe was unusually cold it is hypothesized that this may be due to a combination of low solar activity 16 a warm phase of the el southern oscillation and a strong easterly phase of the quasi biennial oscillation all occurring simultaneously 17 the met office reported that the uk for example had experienced its coldest winter for 30 years this coincided with an exceptionally negative phase of the nao 18 analysis published in mid 2010 confirmed that the concurrent el event and the rare occurrence of an extremely negative nao were involved this has become known as a hybrid el 19 20 however during the winter of 2010-11 in northern and western europe the icelandic low typically positioned west of iceland and east of greenland appeared regularly to the east of iceland and so allowed exceptionally cold air into europe from the arctic a strong area of high pressure was initially situated over greenland reversing the normal wind pattern in the northwestern atlantic creating a blocking pattern driving warm air into northeastern canada and cold air into western europe as was the case during the previous winter this occurred during a la season and is connected to the rare arctic dipole anomaly 21 22 in the north western part of the atlantic both of these winters were mild especially 2009-2010 which was the warmest recorded in canada the winter of 2010-2011 was particularly above normal in the northern arctic regions of that country 23 the probability of cold winters with much snow in central europe rises when the arctic is covered by less sea ice in summer scientists of the research unit potsdam of the alfred wegener institute for polar and marine research in the helmholtz association have decrypted a mechanism in which a shrinking summertime sea ice cover changes the air pressure zones in the arctic atmosphere and effects on european winter weather if there is a particularly large scale melt of arctic sea ice in summer as observed in recent years two important effects are intensified firstly the retreat of the light ice surface reveals the darker ocean causing it to warm up more in summer from the solar radiation ice albedo feedback mechanism secondly the diminished ice cover can no longer prevent the heat stored in the ocean being released into the atmosphere lid effect as a result of the decreased sea ice cover the air is warmed more greatly than it used to be particularly in autumn and winter because during this period the ocean is warmer than the atmosphere the warming of the air near to the ground leads to rising movements and the atmosphere becomes less stable one of these patterns is the air pressure difference between the arctic and mid latitudes the so called arctic oscillation with the azores highs and iceland lows known from the weather reports if this difference is high a strong westerly wind will result which in winter carries warm and humid atlantic air masses right down to europe in the negative phase when pressure differences are low cold arctic air can then easily penetrate southward through europe without being interrupted by the usual westerlies as has been the case frequently over the last three winters model calculations show that the air pressure difference with decreased sea ice cover in the arctic summer is weakened in the following winter enabling arctic cold to push down to mid latitudes 24 winter of in europe edit despite one of the strongest el nino ever recorded in the pacific ocean a largely positive north atlantic oscillation prevailed over europe during the winter of 2015-2016 for example cumbria in england 25 registered one of the wettest months on record meanwhile the maltese islands in the mediterranean sea registered one of the driest years ever recorded up to beginning of march as the national average was only 235mm to date with some areas registering even less than 200mm 26 see also edit arctic oscillation antarctic
