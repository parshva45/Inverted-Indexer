blizzard of 2006 note the hurricane like eye at the center storms are created when a center of low pressure develops with a system of high pressure surrounding it this combination of opposing forces can create winds and result in the formation of storm clouds such as the cumulonimbus small localized areas of low pressure can form from hot air rising off hot ground resulting in smaller disturbances such as dust devils and whirlwinds types edit classic storm of summer in sierras de argentina there are many varieties and names for storms ice storm ice storms are one of the most dangerous forms of winter storms when surface temperatures are below freezing but a thick layer of above freezing air remains aloft rain can fall into the freezing layer and freeze upon impact into a glaze of ice in general 8 millimetres of accumulation is all that is required especially in combination with breezy conditions to start downing power lines as well as tree limbs 3 ice storms also make unheated road surfaces too slick to drive upon ice storms can vary in time range from hours to days and can cripple small towns and large urban centers alike blizzard there are varying definitions for blizzards both over time and by location in general a blizzard is accompanied by gale force winds heavy snow accumulating at a rate of at least 5 centimeters per hour and very cold conditions below approximately -10 degrees celsius or lately the temperature criterion has fallen out of the definition across the united states 4 snowstorm a heavy fall of snow accumulating at a rate of more than 5 centimeters per hour that lasts several hours snow storms especially ones with a high liquid equivalent and breezy conditions can down tree limbs cut off power and paralyze travel over a large region coastal large wind waves and or storm surge that strike the coastal zone their impacts include coastal erosion and coastal flooding 5 ocean storm conditions out at sea are defined as having sustained winds of 48 knots or or greater 6 usually just referred to as a storm these systems can sink vessels of all types and sizes firestorm firestorms are conflagrations which attain such intensity that they create and sustain their own wind systems it is most commonly a natural phenomenon created during some of the largest bushfires forest fires and wildfires the peshtigo fire is one example of a firestorm firestorms can also be deliberate effects of targeted explosives such as occurred as a result of the aerial bombings of dresden nuclear detonations generate firestorms if high winds are not present dust devil a small localized updraft of rising air wind a storm marked by high wind with little or no precipitation 7 windstorm damage often opens the door for massive amounts of water and debris to cause further damage to a structure 8 european windstorms and derechos are two type of windstorms 9 high wind is also the cause of sandstorms in dry climates squall sudden onset of wind increase of at least 16 knots or greater sustained for at least one minute gale an extratropical storm with sustained winds between 34-48 knots or 6 thunderstorm a thunderstorm is a type of storm that generates lightning and the attendant thunder it is normally accompanied by heavy precipitation thunderstorms occur throughout the world with the highest frequency in tropical rainforest regions where there are conditions of high humidity and temperature along with atmospheric instability these storms occur when high levels of condensation form in a volume of unstable air that generates deep rapid upward motion in the atmosphere the heat energy creates powerful rising air currents that swirl upwards to the tropopause cool descending air currents produce strong downdraughts below the storm after the storm has spent its energy the rising currents die away and downdraughts break up the cloud individual storm clouds can measure across tropical cyclone a tropical cyclone is a storm system with a closed circulation around a centre of low pressure fueled by the heat released when moist air rises and condenses the name underscores its origin in the tropics and their cyclonic nature tropical cyclones are distinguished from other cyclonic storms such as and polar lows by the heat mechanism that fuels them which makes them warm core storm systems tropical cyclones form in the oceans if the conditions in the area are favorable and depending on their strength and location there are various terms by which they are called such as tropical depression tropical storm hurricane and typhoon 10 hailstorm a type of storm that precipitates round chunks of ice hailstorms usually occur during regular thunder storms while most of the hail that precipitates from the clouds is fairly small and virtually harmless there are occasional occurrences of hail greater than in diameter that can cause much damage and injuries a tornado in binger oklahoma during the 1981 outbreak tornado a tornado is a violent destructive wind storm occurring on land usually its appearance is that of a dark funnel shaped cloud often tornadoes are preceded by thunderstorms and a wall cloud they are often called the most destructive of storms and while they form all over the world the interior of the united states is the most prone area especially throughout tornado alley classification edit a strict meteorological definition of a terrestrial storm is a wind measuring 10 or higher on the beaufort scale meaning a wind speed of 24.5 m s or more however popular usage is not so restrictive storms can last anywhere from 12 to 200 hours depending on season and geography in north america the east and northeast storms are noted for the most frequent repeatability and duration especially during the cold period big terrestrial storms alter the oceanographic conditions that in turn may affect food abundance and distribution strong currents strong tides increased siltation change in water temperatures overturn in the water column etc extraterrestrial storms edit the great red spot on jupiter storms do not only occur on earth other planetary bodies with a sufficient atmosphere gas giants in particular also undergo stormy weather the great red spot on jupiter provides a well known example though technically an anticyclone with greater than hurricane wind speeds it is larger than the earth and has persisted for at least 340 years having first been observed by astronomer galileo galilei neptune also had its own lesser known great dark spot in september 1994 the hubble telescope using wide field planetary camera 2 imaged storms on saturn generated by upwelling of warmer air similar to a terrestrial thunderhead the east west extent of the same year clarification needed storm equalled the diameter of earth the storm was observed earlier in september 1990 and acquired the name dragon storm the dust storms of mars vary in size but can often cover the entire planet they tend to occur when mars comes closest to the sun and have been shown to increase the global temperature 11 one particularly large martian storm was exhaustively studied up close due to coincidental timing when the first spacecraft to successfully orbit another planet mariner 9 arrived and successfully orbited mars on 14 november 1971 planetary scientists were surprised to find the atmosphere was thick with a planet wide robe of dust the largest storm ever observed on mars the surface of the planet was totally obscured mariner computer was reprogrammed from earth to delay imaging of the surface for a couple of months until the dust settled however the surface obscured images contributed much to the collection of mars atmospheric and planetary surface science 12 two extrasolar planets are known to have storms hd 209458 b 13 and hd 80606 b the storm was discovered on june 23 2010 and measured at while the latter produces winds of 17,700 kilometers per hour across the surface the spin of the planet then creates giant swirling shock wave storms that carry the heat aloft 14 effects on human society edit storm damage redirects here for the british television film see storm damage see also

thunderstorm a sunshower storm in the mojave desert at sunset shipwrecks are common with the passage of strong tropical cyclones such shipwrecks can change the course of history 15 as well as influence art and literature a hurricane led to a victory of the spanish over the french for control of fort caroline and ultimately the atlantic coast of north america in 1565 16 strong winds from any storm type can damage or destroy vehicles buildings bridges and other outside objects turning loose debris into deadly flying projectiles in the united states major hurricanes comprise just 21% of all landfalling tropical cyclones but account for 83% of all damage 17 tropical cyclones often knock out power to tens or hundreds of thousands of people preventing vital communication and hampering rescue efforts 18 tropical cyclones often destroy key bridges overpasses and roads complicating efforts to transport food clean water and medicine to the areas that need it furthermore the damage caused by tropical cyclones to buildings and dwellings can result in economic damage to a region and to a diaspora of the population of the region 19 the storm surge or the increase in sea level due to the cyclone is typically the worst effect from landfalling tropical cyclones historically resulting in 90% of tropical cyclone deaths 19 the relatively quick surge in sea level can move miles kilometers inland flooding homes and cutting off escape routes the storm surges and winds of hurricanes may be destructive to human made structures but they also stir up the waters of coastal estuaries which are typically important fish breeding locales cloud to ground lightning frequently occurs within the phenomena of thunderstorms and have numerous hazards towards landscapes and populations one of the more significant hazards lightning can pose is the wildfires they are capable of igniting 20 under a regime of low precipitation lp thunderstorms where little precipitation is present rainfall cannot prevent fires from starting when vegetation is dry as lightning produces a concentrated amount of extreme heat 21 wildfires can devastate vegetation and the biodiversity of an ecosystem wildfires that occur close to urban environments can inflict damages upon infrastructures buildings crops and provide risks to explosions should the flames be exposed to gas pipes direct damage caused by lightning strikes occurs on occasion 22 in areas with a high frequency for cloud to ground lightning like florida lightning causes several fatalities per year most commonly to people working outside 23 precipitation with low potential of hydrogen levels ph otherwise known as acid rain is also a frequent risk produced by lightning distilled water which contains no carbon dioxide has a neutral ph of 7 liquids with a ph less than 7 are acidic and those with a ph greater than 7 are bases or unpolluted rain has a slightly acidic ph of about 5.2 because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form carbonic acid a weak acid ph 5.6 in distilled water but unpolluted rain also contains other chemicals 24 nitric oxide present during thunderstorm phenomena 25 caused by the splitting of nitrogen molecules can result in the production of acid rain if nitric oxide forms compounds with the water molecules in precipitation thus creating acid rain acid rain can damage infrastructures containing calcite or other solid chemical compounds containing carbon in ecosystems acid rain can dissolve plant tissues of vegetations and increase acidification process in bodies of water and in soil resulting in deaths of marine and terrestrial organisms 26 hail damage to roofs often goes unnoticed until further structural damage is seen such as leaks or cracks it is hardest to recognize hail damage on shingled roofs and flat roofs but all roofs have their own hail damage detection problems 27 metal roofs are fairly resistant to hail damage but may accumulate cosmetic damage in the form of dents and damaged coatings 28 hail is also a common nuisance to drivers of automobiles severely denting the vehicle and cracking or even shattering windshields and windows rarely massive hailstones have been known to cause concussions or fatal head trauma hailstorms have been the cause of costly and deadly events throughout history one of the earliest recorded incidents occurred around the 9th century in roopkund uttarakhand india 29 the largest hailstone in terms of diameter and weight ever recorded in the united states fell on july 23 2010 in vivian south dakota in the united states it measured 8 inches in diameter and 18.62 inches in circumference weighing in at 1.93 pounds 30 this broke the previous record for diameter set by a hailstone diameter and circumference which fell in aurora nebraska in the united states on june 22 2003 as well as the record for weight set by a hailstone of 1.67 pounds that fell in coffeyville kansas in 1970 30 various hazards ranging from hail to lightning can affect outside technology facilities such as antennas satellite dishes and towers as a result companies with outside facilities have begun installing such facilities underground in order to reduce the risk of damage from storms 31 substantial snowfall can disrupt public infrastructure and services slowing human activity even in regions that are accustomed to such weather air and ground transport may be greatly inhibited or shut down entirely populations living in snow prone areas have developed various ways to travel across the snow such as skis snowshoes and sleds pulled by horses dogs or other animals and later snowmobiles basic utilities such as electricity telephone lines and gas supply can also fail in addition snow can make roads much harder to travel and vehicles attempting to use them can easily become stuck 32 the combined effects can lead to a snow day on which gatherings such as school work or church are officially canceled in areas that normally have very little or no snow a snow day may occur when there is only light accumulation or even the threat of snowfall since those areas are unprepared to handle any amount of snow in some areas such as some states in the united states schools are given a yearly quota of snow days or calamity days once the quota is exceeded the snow days must be made up 33 34 35 in other states all snow days must be made up 36 for example schools may extend the remaining school days later into the afternoon shorten spring break or delay the start of summer vacation accumulated snow is removed to make travel easier and safer and to decrease the long term effect of a heavy snowfall this process utilizes shovels and snowplows and is often assisted by sprinkling salt or other chloride based chemicals which reduce the melting temperature of snow 37 in some areas with abundant snowfall such as yamagata prefecture japan people harvest snow and store it surrounded by insulation in ice houses this allows the snow to be used through the summer for refrigeration and air conditioning which requires far less electricity than traditional cooling methods 38 agriculture edit hail can cause serious damage notably to automobiles aircraft skylights glass roofed structures livestock and most commonly farmers crops 39 wheat corn soybeans and tobacco are the most sensitive crops to hail damage 40 hail is one of most expensive hazards 41 snowfall can be beneficial to agriculture by serving as a thermal insulator conserving the heat of the earth and protecting crops from subfreezing weather some agricultural areas depend on an accumulation of snow during winter that will melt gradually in spring providing water for crop growth if it melts into water and refreezes upon sensitive crops such as oranges the resulting ice will protect the fruit from exposure to lower temperatures 42 although tropical cyclones take an enormous toll in lives and personal property they may be important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they affect and bring much needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions hurricanes in the eastern north pacific often supply moisture to the southwestern united states and parts of mexico 43 japan receives over half of its rainfall from typhoons 44 hurricane camille averted drought conditions and ended water deficits along much of its path 45 though it also killed and caused 2005 usd in damage aviation edit effect of wind shear on aircraft trajectory merely correcting for the initial gust front can have dire consequences hail is one of the most significant thunderstorm hazards to aircraft 46 when hail stones exceed 0.5 inches in diameter planes can be seriously damaged within seconds 47 the hailstones accumulating on the ground can also be hazardous to landing aircraft strong wind outflow from thunderstorms causes rapid changes in the three dimensional wind velocity just above ground level initially this outflow causes a headwind that increases airspeed which normally causes a pilot to reduce engine power if they are unaware of the wind shear as the aircraft passes into the region of the downdraft the localized headwind diminishes reducing the airspeed and increasing its sink rate then when the aircraft passes through the other side of the downdraft the headwind becomes a tailwind reducing lift generated by the wings and leaving the aircraft in a low power low speed descent this can lead to an accident if the aircraft is too low to effect a recovery before ground contact as the result of the accidents in the 1970s and 1980s in 1988 the u s federal aviation administration mandated that all commercial aircraft have on board wind shear detection systems by 1993 between 1964 and 1985 wind shear directly caused or contributed to 26 major civil transport aircraft accidents in the u s that led to 620 deaths and 200 injuries since 1995 the number of major civil aircraft accidents caused by wind shear has dropped to approximately one every ten years due to the mandated on board detection as well as the addition of doppler weather radar units on the ground nexrad 48 recreation edit many winter sports such as skiing 49 snowboarding 50 snowmobiling 51 and snowshoeing depend upon snow where snow is scarce but the temperature is low enough snow cannons may be used to produce an adequate amount for such sports 52 children and adults can play on a sled or ride in a sleigh although a footsteps remain a visible lifeline within a snow covered landscape snow cover is considered a general danger to hiking since the snow obscures landmarks and makes the landscape itself appear uniform 53 notable storms in art and culture edit the great wave off kanagawa a ukiyo e print by hokusai in mythology and literature edit according to the bible a giant storm sent by god flooded the earth noah and his family and the animals entered the ark and the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights the flood covered even the highest mountains to a depth of more than twenty feet and all creatures died only noah and those with him on the ark were left alive in the new testament jesus christ is recorded to have calmed a storm on the sea of galilee see

play the tempest 1611 55 specifically sir thomas gates future governor of virginia was on his way to england from jamestown virginia on saint james day while he was between cuba and the bahamas a hurricane raged for nearly two days though one of the small vessels in the fleet sank to the bottom of the florida straits seven of the remaining vessels reached virginia within several days after the storm the flagship of the fleet known as sea adventure disappeared and was presumed lost a small bit of fortune befell the ship and her crew when they made landfall on bermuda the vessel was damaged on a surrounding coral reef but all aboard survived for nearly a year on the island the british colonists claimed the island and quickly settled bermuda in may 1610 they set forth for jamestown this time arriving at their destination the novel the wonderful wizard of oz written by l frank baum and illustrated by w w denslow chronicles the adventures of a young girl named dorothy gale in the land of oz after being swept away from her kansas farm home by a tornado the story was originally published by the george m hill company in chicago on may 17 1900 and has since been reprinted numerous times most often under the name the wizard of oz and adapted for use in other media thanks in part to the 1939 mgm movie it is one of the best known stories in american popular culture and has been widely translated its initial success and the success of the popular 1902 broadway musical which baum adapted from his original story led to writing thirteen more oz books hollywood director king vidor february 8 november 1 1982 survived the galveston hurricane of 1900 as a boy based on that experience he published a fictionalized account of that cyclone titled southern storm for the may 1935 issue of esquire magazine erik larson excerpts a passage from that article in his 2005 book storm 56 i remember now that it seemed as if we were in a bowl looking up toward the level of the sea as we stood there in the sandy street my mother and i i wanted to take my hand and hurry her away i felt as if the sea was going to break over the edge of the bowl and come puring down upon us numerous other accounts of the galveston hurricane of 1900 have been made in print and in film larson cites many of them in storm which centrally features that storm as well as chronicles the creation of the weather bureau which came to known as the national weather service and that fateful rivalry with the weather service in cuba and a number of other major storms such as those which ravaged indianola texas in 1875 and 1886 56 the great storm of 1987 is key in an important scene near the end of possession a romance the bestselling and man booker prize winning novel by a s byatt the great storm of 1987 occurred on the night of october 1987 when an unusually strong weather system caused winds to hit much of southern england and northern france it was the worst storm to hit england since the great storm of 1703 57 284 years earlier and was responsible for the deaths of at least in england and france combined 18 in england at least four in france 58 hurricane katrina 2005 has been featured in a number of works of fiction in fine art edit rembrandt s the storm on the sea of galilee the romantic seascape painters j m w turner and ivan aivazovsky created some of the most lasting impressions of the sublime and stormy seas that are firmly imprinted on the popular mind representations of powerful natural forces reinvented the traditional seascape during the first half of the nineteenth century upon his travels to holland he took note of the familiar large rolling waves of the english seashore transforming into the sharper choppy waves of a dutch storm a characteristic example of dramatic seascape is the slave ship of 1840 aivazovsky left several thousand turbulent canvases in which he increasingly eliminated human figures and historical background to focus on such essential elements as light sea and sky his grandiose ninth wave 1850 is an ode to human daring in the face of the elements in motion pictures edit the 1926 silent film the johnstown flood features the great flood of 1889 in johnstown pennsylvania the flood caused by the catastrophic failure of the south fork dam after days of extremely heavy rainfall prompted the first major disaster relief
