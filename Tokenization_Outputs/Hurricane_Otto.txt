broad low pressure area forming north of colombia on november 15 1 the low moved slowly and erratically with a disorganized structure and light winds 4 disrupted by unfavorable upper level conditions

costa rica 10 and the first hurricane force system to traverse the nation 1 around on the eye of otto emerged over the eastern pacific near the gulf of papagayo completing a rare crossover from the

tropical storm continuing to move westwards due to the influence of a subtropical ridge to its north otto steadily weakened as it moved away from central america unfavorable environmental conditions hastened the demise and otto weakened to a tropical depression on soon thereafter the system degraded into a trough roughly south of salina cruz mexico the remnant system continued to produce
