director acting parent agency united states department of the interior website usgs gov the united states geological survey usgs formerly simply geological survey is a scientific agency of the united states government the scientists of the usgs study the landscape of the united states its natural resources and the natural hazards that threaten it the organization has four major science disciplines concerning biology geography geology and hydrology the usgs is a fact finding research organization with no regulatory responsibility the usgs is a bureau of the united states department of the interior it is that sole scientific agency the usgs employs approximately 8,670 people 2 and is headquartered in reston virginia the usgs also has major offices near lakewood colorado at the denver federal center and menlo park california the current motto of the usgs in use since august 1997 is science for a changing world 3 4 the previous slogan adopted on the occasion of its hundredth anniversary was earth science in the public service 5 contents 1 history 1.1 list of usgs directors 2 programs 2.1 topographic mapping 3 the national map and u s topo 4 usgs hydrologic instrumentation

history edit prompted by a report from the national academy of sciences the usgs was created by a last minute amendment to an act of congress on march 3 1879 it was charged with the classification of the public lands and examination of the geological structure mineral resources and products of the national domain this task was driven by the need to inventory the vast lands added to the united states by the louisiana purchase in 1803 and the war in 1848 the legislation also provided that the hayden powell and wheeler surveys be discontinued as of june 30 1879 6 clarence king the first director of usgs assembled the new organization from disparate regional survey agencies after a short tenure king was succeeded in the chair by john wesley powell list of usgs directors edit clarence

station 03221000 on the scioto river below dam near dublin ohio earthquake animations from the past 7 days recent earthquakes from the past days around the world since 2012 the usgs science focus is directed at six topical mission areas 7 namely 1 climate and land use change 2 core science systems 3 ecosystems 4 energy and minerals and environmental health 5 natural hazards and 6 water in december 2012 the usgs split the energy and minerals and environmental health mission area resulting in seven topical mission areas with the two new areas being energy and minerals and environmental health administratively it is divided into a headquarters unit and six regional units 8 other specific programs include earthquake hazards program 9 monitors earthquake activity worldwide the national earthquake information center neic in golden colorado on the campus of the colorado school of mines detects the location and magnitude of global earthquakes the usgs also runs or supports several regional monitoring networks in the united states under the umbrella of the advanced national seismic system anss 10 the usgs informs authorities emergency responders the media and the public both domestic and worldwide about significant earthquakes it also maintains long term archives of earthquake data for scientific and engineering research it also conducts and supports research on long term seismic hazards usgs has released the ucerf california earthquake forecast as of 2005 the agency is working to create a national volcano early warning system by improving the instrumentation monitoring the 169 volcanoes in u s territory and by establishing methods for measuring the relative threats posed at each site the usgs national geomagnetism program monitors the magnetic field at magnetic observatories and distributes magnetometer data in real time the usgs collaborates with canadian and mexican government scientists along with the commission for environmental cooperation to produce the north american environmental atlas which is used to depict and track environmental issues for a continental perspective the usgs operates the streamgaging network for the united states with over 7400 streamgages real time streamflow data 11 are available online national climate change and wildlife science center nccwsc 12 implements partner driven science to improve understanding of past and present land use change develops relevant climate and land use forecasts and identifies lands resources and communities that are most vulnerable to adverse impacts of change from the local to global scale 13 since 1962 the astrogeology research program has been involved in global lunar and planetary exploration and mapping in collaboration with stanford university the usgs also operates the usgs stanford ion microprobe laboratory 14 a world class citation needed 15 analytical facility for u th pb geochronology and trace element analyses of minerals and other earth materials usgs operates a number of water related programs notably the national streamflow information program 16 and national water quality assessment program 17 usgs water data is publicly available from their national water information system 18 database the usgs also operates the national wildlife health center whose mission is to serve the nation and its natural resources by providing sound science and technical support and to disseminate information to promote science based decisions affecting wildlife and ecosystem health the nwhc provides information technical assistance research education and leadership on national and international wildlife health issues 19 it is the agency primarily responsible for surveillance of h5n1 avian influenza outbreaks in the united states the usgs also runs 17 biological research centers in the united states including the patuxent wildlife research center the usgs is investigating collaboration with the social networking site twitter to allow for more rapid construction of shakemaps 20 21 topographic mapping edit 1892 15 minute map or topographic sheet of the mount marcy area of the adirondacks in new york state from the first decades of the usgs the usgs produces several national series of topographic maps which vary in scale and extent with some wide gaps in coverage notably the complete absence of 1 50 000 scale topographic maps or their equivalent the largest both in terms of scale and quantity and best known topographic series is the 7 5 minute 1 24 000 scale quadrangle a non metric scale virtually unique to the united states each of these maps covers an area bounded by two lines of latitude and two lines of longitude spaced 7.5 minutes apart nearly 57,000 individual maps in this series cover the 48 contiguous states hawaii and areas of alaska near anchorage fairbanks and prudhoe bay the area covered by each map varies with the latitude of its represented location due to convergence of the meridians at lower latitudes near north a 7 5 minute quadrangle contains an area of about 64 square miles 2 at north latitude 49 square miles 2 are contained within a quadrangle of that size as a unique non metric map scale the 1 24 000 scale naturally requires a separate and specialized romer scale for plotting map positions 22 23 in recent years budget constraints have forced the usgs to rely on donations of time by civilian volunteers in an attempt to update its 7 5 minute topographic map series and usgs stated outright in 2000 that the program was to be phased out in favor of the national map 24 not to be confused with the national atlas of the united states produced by the department of the interior one of whose bureaus is usgs an older series of maps the 15 minute series was once used to map the contiguous 48 states at a scale of 1 62 500 but was discontinued some time ago for maps covering the continental united states each map was bounded by two parallels and two meridians spaced 15 minutes same area covered by four maps in the 7 5 minute series the 15 minute series at a scale of 1 63 360 one inch representing one mile remains the primary topographic quadrangle for the state of alaska and only for that particular state nearly 3,000 maps cover 97% of the state 22 the united states remains virtually the only developed country in the world without a standardized civilian topographic map series in the standard 1 25 000 or 1 50 000 metric scales making coordination difficult in border regions the u s military does issue 1 50 000 scale topo maps of the continental united states though only for use by members of its defense forces the next smallest topographic series in terms of scale is the 1 100 000 series these maps are bounded by two lines of longitude and two lines of latitude however in this series the lines of latitude are spaced 30 minutes apart and the lines of longitude are spaced 60 minutes which is the source of another name for these maps the 30 x 60 minute quadrangle series each of these quadrangles covers the area contained within 32 maps in the 7 5 minute series the 1 100 000 scale series is unusual in that it employs the metric system primarily one centimeter on the map represents one kilometer of distance on the ground contour intervals spot elevations and horizontal distances are also specified in meters the final regular quadrangle series produced by the usgs is the 1 250 000 scale topographic series each of these quadrangles in the conterminous united states measures of latitude by of longitude this series was produced by the u s army map service in the 1950s prior to the maps in the larger scale series and consists of 489 sheets each covering an area ranging from 8,218 square miles 2 at north to 6,222 square miles 2 at north 22 hawaii is mapped at this scale in quadrangles measuring by usgs topographic quadrangle maps are marked with grid lines and tics around the map collar which make it possible to identify locations on the map by several methods including the graticule measurements of longitude and latitude the township and section method within the public land survey system and cartesian coordinates in both the state plane coordinate system and the universal transverse mercator coordinate system other specialty maps have been produced by the usgs at a variety of scales these include county maps maps of special interest areas such as the national parks and areas of scientific interest a number of internet sites have made these maps available on the web for affordable commercial and professional use because works of the are in the public domain it is also possible to find many of these maps for free at various locations on the internet georeferenced map images are available from the usgs as digital raster graphics drgs in addition to digital data sets based on usgs maps notably digital line graphs dlgs and digital elevation models dems in 2015 the usgs unveiled the topoview website a new way to view their entire digitized collection of over 178,000 maps from the site is an interactive map of the united states that allows users to search or move around the map to find the usgs collection of maps for a specific area users may then view the maps in great detail and download them if desired 25 the national map and u s topo edit in 2008 the usgs abandoned traditional methods of surveying revising and updating topographic maps based on aerial photography and field checks 26 u s topo quadrangle 1 24 000 maps are mass produced using automated and semiautomated processes with cartographic content supplied from the national gis database 26 in the two years from june 2009 to may 2011 the usgs produced nearly 40,000 maps more than 80 maps per work day 26 only about two hours of interactive work are spent on each map mostly on text placement and final inspection there are essentially no field checks or field inspections to confirm map details 26 while much less expensive to compile and produce the revised digital u s topo maps have been criticized for a lack of accuracy and detail in comparison to older generation maps based on aerial photo survey and field checks 26 as the digital databases were not designed for producing general purpose maps data integration can be a problem when retrieved from sources with different resolutions and collection dates 26 man made features once recorded by direct field observation are not in any public domain national database and are frequently omitted from the newest generation digital topo maps including windmills mines and mineshafts water tanks fence lines survey marks parks recreational trails buildings boundaries pipelines telephone lines power transmission lines and even railroads 26 additionally the digital use of existing software may not properly integrate different feature classes or prioritize and organize text in areas of crowded features obscuring important geographic details 26 as a result some have noted that the u s topo maps currently fall short of traditional topographic map presentation standards achieved in maps drawn from 1945 to 1992 26 usgs hydrologic instrumentation facility edit the hydrologic instrumentation facility hif has four sections within its organizational structure 27 the field services section which includes the warehouse repair shop and engineering unit the testing section which includes the hydraulic laboratory testing chambers and water quality laboratory the information technology section which includes computer support and the drafting unit and the administrative section the hif was given national responsibility for the design testing evaluation repair calibration warehousing and distribution of hydrologic instrumentation distribution is accomplished by direct sales and through a rental program the hif supports data collection activities through centralized warehouse and laboratory facilities the hif warehouse provides hydrologic instruments equipment and supplies for usgs as well as other federal agencies ofa and usgs cooperators the hif also tests evaluates repairs calibrates and develops hydrologic equipment and instruments the hif hydraulic laboratory facilities include a towing tank jet tank pipe flow facility and tilting flume in addition the hif provides training and technical support for the equipment it stocks the engineering group seeks out new technology and designs for instrumentation that can work more efficiently be more accurate and or be produced at a lower cost than existing instrumentation hif works directly with vendors to help them produce products that will meet the mission needs of the usgs for instrument needs not currently met by a vendor the engineering group designs tests and issues contracts to have hif designed equipment made sometimes hif will patent a new design in the hope that instrument vendors will buy the rights and mass produce the instrument at a lower cost to everyone usgs publications edit usgs researchers publish the results of their science in a variety of ways many researchers publish their science in peer reviewed scientific journals as well as in one of a variety of series that includes series for preliminary results maps data and final results these series include biological science report bsr record significant scientific interpretations and findings usually of
