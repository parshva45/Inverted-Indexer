atlantic hurricane season that produced eleven tropical cyclones nine named storms three hurricanes and two major hurricanes 1 nb 1 it officially began on and ended on dates that conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones develop in the atlantic basin 3 the first tropical cyclone tropical depression one developed on 4 while the final storm hurricane ida dissipated on 5 the most intense hurricane bill was a powerful cape verde type hurricane that affected areas from the leeward islands to newfoundland 6 the season featured the lowest number of tropical cyclones since the 1997 season and only one system claudette made landfall in the united states forming from the interaction of a tropical wave and an upper level low claudette made landfall on the florida panhandle with maximum sustained winds of before quickly dissipating over alabama the storm killed two people and caused $228,000 2009 usd in damage pre season forecasts issued by colorado state university csu called for fourteen named storms and seven hurricanes of which three were expected to attain major hurricane status nb 2 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa later issued its initial forecast which predicted nine to fourteen named storms four to seven hurricanes and one to three major hurricanes after several revisions in the projected number of named storms both agencies lowered their forecasts by the middle of the season several storms made landfall or directly affected land outside of the united states tropical storm ana brought substantial rainfall totals to many of the caribbean islands including puerto rico which led to minor street flooding hurricane bill delivered gusty winds and rain to the island of newfoundland while tropical storm danny affected the u s state of north carolina and erika affected the lesser antilles as a poorly organized tropical system hurricane fred affected the cape verde islands as a developing tropical cyclone and tropical storm grace briefly impacted the azores becoming the farthest northeast forming storm on record the final storm ida affected portions of central america before

eleven tropical cyclones affected land of which five actually made landfall the united states experienced one of its quietest years with no hurricanes making landfall in the country throughout the basin six people were killed in tropical cyclone related incidents and total losses reached roughly most of the damage resulted from hurricane bill which caused severe beach erosion throughout the east coast of the united states in the united states tropical cyclones killed six people and caused roughly in damage in the lesser antilles tropical storms ana and erika brought moderate rainfall to several islands but resulted in little damage elsewhere in the atlantic the azores islands atlantic canada bermuda cape verde islands and wales were affected by tropical cyclones or their remnants 1 in canada hurricane bill produced widespread moderate rainfall in nova scotia and newfoundland leaving roughly in losses 14 the hurricane also produced tropical storm force winds in bermuda 6 hurricane fred briefly impacted the southern cape verde islands as it bypassed the islands early in its existence 15 the azores and wales were also affected by tropical storm grace however both areas recorded only minor effects 16 overall the activity was reflected with a low cumulative accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of 53 the lowest since 1997 17 due to the low number of storms in the 2009 season many of which were short lived the overall ace value was ranked as below average totaling under 66 18 hurricane bill was responsible for the ace value for august being 30% above average 19 ace is broadly speaking a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces ace is

convection developed across a small area over the low pressure system leading to the national hurricane center classifying the system as tropical depression one the depression moved over the warm waters of the gulf stream for the following allowing it to maintain its convection before moving into a hostile environment characterized by strong wind shear and cooler waters late on the system degenerated into a remnant low several hours later on about south southeast of halifax nova scotia tropical depression one was absorbed by a warm front 4 as a tropical cyclone the depression had no impact on land however the precursor to the system brought scattered rainfall and increased winds to parts of the north carolina coastline but no damage 4 upon becoming a tropical depression on

time it was named ana after reaching a peak intensity with winds of and a barometric pressure of hpa the storm began to weaken again due to increasing wind shear and the unusually fast movement of ana in post storm analysis it was discovered that ana had degenerated into a tropical wave once more on before reaching any landmasses 22 numerous tropical storm watches were issued for the lesser antilles puerto rico and the dominican republic between and 17 22 several islands took minor precautions for the storm including st croix which evacuated from flood prone areas ahead of the storm 23 in the dominican republic officials took preparations by setting up relief agencies and setting up shelters 24 impact from ana was minimal mainly consisting of light to moderate rainfall 22 in puerto

midway between the cape verde islands and the lesser antilles eventually the hurricane attained its peak intensity as a storm roughly east northeast of the leeward islands the storm attained maximum winds of the highest of any storm during the season before weakening slightly as it turned north the large storm passed roughly west of bermuda as a hurricane further weakening took place as bill brushed the southern coast of nova scotia the following day shortly before making landfall in newfoundland bill weakened to a tropical storm and accelerated the storm eventually transitioned into an extratropical cyclone after moving over the north atlantic before being absorbed by a larger non tropical low on 6 two people were killed by the large in maine and another in florida the hurricane came close enough to warrant tropical cyclone watches and warnings in both the us and canada bill was one of three tropical storms active on 6 large life threatening swells produced by the storm

depression and the hydrometeorological prediction center took over primary responsibility of the storm the system quickly dissipated and was last noted over alabama on 30 the national hurricane center

increased by to its peak of upon reaching this intensity fred became the strongest storm on record south of and east of in the atlantic basin not long after the intensification ceased it began to weaken as dry air became entrained within the system by the storm nearly stalled northwest of the cape verde islands and weakened to a tropical storm the following day fred degenerated into a remnant

moving inland over the southern united states ida transitioned into an extratropical cyclone the remnants of ida persisted until at which time the low dissipated remnant energy from ida provided
