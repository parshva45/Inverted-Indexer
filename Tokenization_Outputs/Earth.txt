object in the universe known to harbor life according to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence earth formed over 4 billion years ago 24 25 26 gravity interacts with other objects in space especially the sun and the moon only natural satellite earth revolves around the sun in 365.26 days a period known as an earth year during this time earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times n 5 axis of rotation is tilted producing seasonal variations on the surface 27 the gravitational interaction between the earth and moon causes ocean tides stabilizes the orientation on its axis and gradually slows its rotation 28 earth is the densest planet in the solar system and the largest of the four terrestrial planets lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years about 71% of surface is covered with water mostly by oceans 29 the remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes rivers and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere the majority of polar regions are covered in ice including the antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the arctic ice pack interior remains active with a solid iron inner core a liquid outer core that generates the magnetic field and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics within the first billion years of history life appeared in the oceans and began to affect the atmosphere and surface leading to the proliferation of aerobic and anaerobic organisms some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as much as 4.1 billion years ago since then the combination of distance from the sun physical properties and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive 30 31 in the history of the earth biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion occasionally punctuated by mass extinction events over 99% of all species 32 that ever lived on earth are extinct 33 34 estimates

notes 12 references 13 further reading 14 external links name and etymology the modern english word earth developed from a wide variety of middle english forms n 6 which derived from an old english noun most often spelled 39 it has cognates in every germanic language and their proto germanic root has been reconstructed as in its earliest appearances was already being used to translate the many senses of latin terra and greek the ground n 7 its soil n 8 dry land n 9 the human world n 10 the surface of the world including the sea n 11 and the globe itself n 12 as with terra and gaia earth was a personified goddess in germanic paganism the angles were listed by tacitus as among the devotees of nerthus 48 and later norse mythology included a giantess often given as the mother of thor 49 originally earth was written in lowercase and from early middle english its definite sense as the globe was expressed as the earth by early modern english many nouns were capitalized and the earth became and often remained the earth particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies more recently the name is sometimes simply given as earth by analogy with the names of the other planets 39 house styles now vary oxford spelling recognizes the lowercase form as the most common with the capitalized form an acceptable variant another convention capitalizes earth when appearing as a name e g atmosphere but writes it in lowercase when preceded by the e g the atmosphere of the earth it almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as what on earth are you doing 50 chronology main article history of earth formation impression of the early solar planetary disk the oldest material found in the solar system is dated to 4.5672 0.0006 billion years ago bya 51 by 4.54 52 the primordial earth had formed the formation and evolution of solar system bodies occurred along with the sun in theory a solar nebula partitions a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse which begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk and then the planets grow out of that disk along with the sun a nebula contains gas ice grains and dust including primordial nuclides according to nebular theory planetesimals formed by accretion with the primordial earth taking 20 million years mys to form 53 a subject of on going research is the formation of the moon some 4.53 bya 54 a working hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from earth after a mars sized object named theia impacted earth 55 in this scenario the mass of theia was approximately 10% of that of earth 56 it impacted earth with a glancing blow 57 and some of its mass merged with earth between approximately 4.1 and numerous asteroid impacts during the late heavy bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the moon and by inference to that of earth geological history main article geological history of earth hoodoos at the bryce canyon national park utah atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing that included water vapor the origin of the oceans was condensation augmented by water and ice delivered by asteroids protoplanets and comets 58 in this model atmospheric greenhouse gases kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming sun had only 70% of its current luminosity 59 by magnetic field was established which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind 60 a crust formed when the molten outer layer of earth cooled to form a solid the two models 61 that explain land mass propose either a steady growth to the present day forms 62 or more likely a rapid growth 63 early in earth history 64 followed by a long term steady continental area 65 66 67 continents formed by plate tectonics a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from interior on time scales lasting hundreds of millions of years the supercontinents have assembled and broken apart roughly years ago mya one of the earliest known supercontinents rodinia began to break apart the continents later recombined to form pannotia then finally pangaea which also broke apart 68 the present pattern of ice ages began about and then intensified during the pleistocene about high latitude regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw repeating

reactions led to the first self replicating molecules about four billion years ago a half billion years later the last common ancestor of all life arose 70 the evolution of photosynthesis allowed the energy to be harvested directly by life forms the resultant molecular oxygen o 2 accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation formed a protective ozone layer o 3 in the upper atmosphere 71 the incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of complex cells called eukaryotes 72 true multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer life colonized surface 73 among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion year old sandstone in western australia 74 75 76 77 78 biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion year old metasedimentary rocks in western greenland 79 remains of biotic material found in 4.1 billion year old rocks in western australia 30 31 during the neoproterozoic 750 to much of earth might have been covered in ice this hypothesis has been termed snowball earth and it is of particular interest because it preceded the cambrian explosion when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity 80 following the cambrian explosion there have been five major mass extinctions 81 the most recent such event was when an asteroid impact triggered the extinction of the non avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles but spared some small animals such as mammals which then resembled shrews over the past 66 mys mammalian life has diversified and several million years ago an african ape like animal such as orrorin tugenensis gained the ability to stand upright 82 this facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain which allowed the evolution of humans the development of agriculture and then civilization led to humans having an influence on earth and the nature and quantity of other life forms that continues today 83 future main article future of earth see also global catastrophic risk expected long term future is closely tied to that of the sun over the next solar luminosity will increase by 10 and over the next by 40 84 the increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic co 2 cycle reducing its concentration to levels lethally low for plants 10 ppm for c4 photosynthesis in approximately 85 the lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere and animal life will become extinct 86 after another billion years all surface water will have disappeared 87 and the mean global temperature will reach 70 86 158 from that point the earth is expected to be habitable for another 85 possibly up to if nitrogen is removed from the atmosphere 88 even if the sun were eternal and stable 27% of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the mantle in one billion years due to reduced steam venting from mid ocean ridges 89 the sun will evolve to become a red giant in about models predict that the sun will expand to roughly 1 au which is about 250 times its present radius 84 90 fate is less clear as a red giant the sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass so without tidal effects earth will move to an orbit from the sun when the star reaches its maximum radius most if not all remaining life will be destroyed by the increased luminosity peaking at about 5,000 times its present level 84 a 2008 simulation indicates that orbit will eventually decay due to tidal effects and drag causing it to enter the atmosphere and be vaporized 90 physical characteristics shape shape of planet earth shown are distances between surface relief and the geocentre the south american andes summits are visible as elevated areas data from the earth2014 91 global relief model main article figure of the earth the shape of earth is approximately oblate spheroidal due to rotation the earth is flattened along the geographic axis and bulging around the equator 92 the diameter of the earth at the equator is 43 kilometres larger than the pole to pole diameter 93 thus the point on the surface farthest from center of mass is the summit of the equatorial chimborazo volcano in ecuador 94 95 96 97 the average diameter of the reference spheroid is 12,742 kilometres local topography deviates from this idealized spheroid although on a global scale these deviations are small compared to radius the maximum deviation of only 0.17% is at the mariana trench 10,911 metres below local sea level whereas mount everest 8,848 metres above local sea level represents a deviation of 0.14 n 13 in geodesy the exact shape that oceans would adopt in the absence of land and perturbations such as tides and winds is called the geoid more precisely the geoid is the surface of gravitational equipotential at mean sea level chemical composition see

lime magnesia potash and soda 99 100 101 internal structure main article structure of the earth interior like that of the other terrestrial planets is divided into layers by their chemical or physical rheological properties the outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle the crust is separated from the mantle by the discontinuity the thickness of the crust varies from about 6 km kilometers under the oceans to for the continents the crust and the cold rigid top of the upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere and it is of the lithosphere that the tectonic plates are composed beneath the lithosphere is the asthenosphere a relatively low viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at 410 and below the surface spanning a transition zone that separates the upper and lower mantle beneath the mantle an extremely low viscosity liquid outer core lies above a solid inner core 102 the inner core might rotate at a slightly higher angular velocity than the remainder of the planet advancing by per year 103 the radius of the inner core is about one fifth of that of earth geologic layers of earth 104 earth cutaway from core to exosphere not to scale depth 105 km component layer density g cm 3 lithosphere n 14 crust n 15 upper mantle mantle asthenosphere outer core inner core heat main article internal heat budget internal heat comes from a combination of residual heat from planetary accretion about 20 and heat produced through radioactive decay 80 106 the major heat producing isotopes within earth are potassium 40 uranium 238 and thorium 232 107 at the center the temperature may be up to 108 and the pressure could reach 360 gpa 109 because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay scientists postulate that early in history before isotopes with short half lives were depleted heat production was much higher at approximately 3 ga twice the present day heat would have been produced increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today 106 110 present day major heat producing isotopes 111 isotope heat release w kg isotope half life years mean mantle concentration kg isotope kg mantle heat

from earth is 87 mw m for a global heat loss of 4.42 10 13 w 112 a portion of the thermal energy is transported toward the crust by mantle plumes a form of convection consisting of upwellings of higher temperature rock these plumes can produce hotspots and flood basalts 113 more of the heat in earth is lost through plate tectonics by mantle upwelling associated with mid ocean ridges the final major mode of heat loss is through conduction through the lithosphere the majority of which occurs under the oceans because the crust there is much thinner than that of the continents 114 tectonic plates major plates 115 plate name area 10 6 km 2 pacific plate 103.3 african plate n 16 78.0 north american plate 75.9 eurasian plate 67.8 antarctic plate 60.9 indo australian plate 47.2 south american plate 43.6 main article plate tectonics the mechanically rigid outer layer of earth the lithosphere is divided into pieces called tectonic plates these plates are rigid segments that move in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries convergent boundaries at which two plates come together divergent boundaries at which two plates are pulled apart and transform boundaries in which two plates slide past one another laterally earthquakes volcanic activity mountain building and oceanic trench formation can occur along these plate boundaries 116 the tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere the solid but less viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates 117 as the tectonic plates migrate oceanic crust is subducted under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries at the same time the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid ocean ridges the combination of these processes recycles the oceanic crust back into the mantle due to this recycling most of the ocean floor is less than old in age the oldest oceanic crust is located in the western pacific and has an estimated age of 118 119 by comparison the oldest dated continental crust is 120 the seven major plates are the pacific north american eurasian african antarctic indo australian and south american other notable plates include the arabian plate the caribbean plate the nazca plate off the west coast of south america and the scotia plate in the southern atlantic ocean the australian plate fused with the indian plate between 50 and the fastest moving plates are the oceanic plates with the cocos plate advancing at a rate of 121 and the pacific plate moving at the other extreme the slowest moving plate is the eurasian plate progressing at a typical rate of 122 surface main articles lithosphere landform and extreme points of earth present day earth altimetry and bathymetry data from the national geophysical data center the total surface area of the earth is about km 2 197 million sq mi 13 of this 70.8 13 or 2 139.43 million sq mi is below sea level and covered by ocean water 123 below the surface are much of the continental shelf mountains volcanoes 93 oceanic trenches submarine canyons oceanic plateaus abyssal plains and a globe spanning mid ocean ridge system the remaining 29.2% 2 or 57.51 million sq mi not covered by water has terrain that varies greatly from place to place and consists of mountains deserts plains plateaus and other landforms tectonics and erosion volcanic eruptions flooding weathering glaciation the growth of coral reefs and meteorite impacts are among the processes that constantly reshape the surface over geological time 124 125 the continental crust consists of lower density material such as the igneous rocks granite and andesite less common is basalt a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors 126 sedimentary rock is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes buried and compacted together nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks although they form about 5% of the crust 127 the third form of rock material found on earth is metamorphic rock which is created from the transformation of pre existing rock types through high pressures high temperatures or both the most abundant silicate minerals on surface include quartz feldspars amphibole mica pyroxene and olivine 128 common carbonate minerals include calcite found in limestone and dolomite 129 the elevation of the land surface varies from the low point of at the dead sea to a maximum altitude of at the top of mount everest the mean height of land above sea level is about 797 metres 130 the pedosphere is the outermost layer of continental surface and is composed of soil and subject to soil formation processes the total arable land is 10.9% of the land surface with 1.3% being permanent cropland 131 132 close to 40% of land surface is used for cropland and pasture or an estimated 1.3 10 7 km 2 of cropland and 3.4 10 7 km 2 of pastureland 133 hydrosphere main article hydrosphere elevation histogram of surface the abundance of water on surface is a unique feature that distinguishes the blue planet from other planets in the solar system hydrosphere consists chiefly of the oceans but technically includes all water surfaces in the world including inland seas lakes rivers and underground waters down to a depth of the deepest underwater location is challenger deep of the mariana trench in the pacific ocean with a depth of n 17 134 the mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35 10 18 metric tons or about 1/4400 of total mass the oceans cover an area of 3.618 10 8 km 2 with a mean depth of resulting in an estimated volume of 1.332 10 9 km 3 135 if all of crustal surface were at the same elevation as a smooth sphere the depth of the resulting world ocean would be 2.7 to 136 137 about 97.5% of the water is saline the remaining 2.5% is fresh water most fresh water about 68.7 is present as ice in ice caps and glaciers 138 the average salinity of oceans is about of salt per kilogram of sea water 3 5 salt 139 most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks 140 the oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms 141 sea water has an important influence on the climate with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir 142 shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts such as the el oscillation 143 atmosphere main article atmosphere of earth satellite image of earth cloud cover using nasa s moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer the atmospheric pressure on surface averages 101.325 kpa with a scale height of about 3 it has a composition of 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen with trace amounts of water vapor carbon dioxide and other gaseous molecules the height of the troposphere varies with latitude ranging between at the poles to at the equator with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors 144 biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere oxygenic photosynthesis evolved forming the primarily atmosphere of today 71 this change enabled the proliferation of aerobic organisms and indirectly the formation of the ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric o 2 into o 3 the ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation permitting life on land 145 other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor providing useful gases causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface and moderating temperature 146 this last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground thereby raising the average temperature water vapor carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere without this heat retention effect the average surface temperature would be in contrast to the current 147 and life on earth probably would not exist in its current form 148 in may 2017 glints of light seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere 149 150 weather and climate main articles weather and climate hurricane felix seen from low earth orbit september 2007 lenticular cloud with a pressure ridge near mount discovery antarctica november 2013 massive clouds above the mojave desert february 2016 atmosphere has no definite boundary slowly becoming thinner and fading into outer space three quarters of the mass is contained within the first of the surface this lowest layer is called the troposphere energy from the sun heats this layer and the surface below causing expansion of the air this lower density air then rises and is replaced by cooler higher density air the result is atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy 151 the primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the trade winds in the equatorial region below latitude and the westerlies in the mid latitudes between and 152 ocean currents are also important factors in determining climate particularly the thermohaline circulation that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions 153 water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere when atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm humid air this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation 151 most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes this water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods precipitation patterns vary widely ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter atmospheric circulation topographic features and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region 154 the amount of solar energy reaching surface decreases with increasing latitude at higher latitudes the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere as a result the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about per degree of latitude from the equator 155 surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate ranging from the equator to the polar regions these are the tropical or equatorial subtropical temperate and polar climates 156 this latitudinal rule has several anomalies proximity to oceans moderates the climate for example the scandinavian peninsula has more moderate climate than similarly northern latitudes of northern canada the wind enables this moderating effect the windward side of a land mass experiences more moderation than the leeward side in the northern hemisphere the prevailing wind is west to east and western coasts tend to be milder than eastern coasts this is seen in eastern north america and western europe where rough continental climates appear on the east coast on parallels with mild climates on the other side of the ocean 157 in the southern hemisphere the prevailing wind is east to west and the eastern coasts are milder the distance from the earth to the sun varies the earth is closest to the sun at perihelion in january which is summer in the southern hemisphere it is furthest away at aphelion in july which is summer in the northern hemisphere and only 93.55% of the solar radiation from the sun falls on a given square area of land than at perihelion despite this there are larger land masses in the northern hemisphere which are easier to heat than the seas consequently summers are warmer in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere under similar conditions 158 the climate is colder at high altitudes than at sea level because of the decreased air density the commonly used climate classification system has five broad groups humid tropics arid humid middle latitudes continental and cold polar which are further divided into more specific subtypes 152 the system rates regions of terrain based on observed temperature and precipitation the highest air temperature ever measured on earth was in furnace creek california in death valley in 1913 159 the lowest air temperature ever directly measured on earth was at vostok station in 1983 160 but satellites have used remote sensing to measure temperatures as low as in east antarctica 161 these temperature records are only measurements made with modern instruments from the 20th century onwards and likely do not reflect the full range of temperature on earth upper atmosphere this view from orbit shows the full moon partially obscured by atmosphere above the troposphere the atmosphere is usually divided into the stratosphere mesosphere and thermosphere 146 each layer has a different lapse rate defining the rate of change in temperature with height beyond these the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind 162 within the stratosphere is the ozone layer a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on earth the line defined as above surface is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space 163 thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from gravity this causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass it can achieve escape velocity more readily and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases 164 the leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere 165 hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on earth 166 in the current oxygen rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape instead most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere 167 gravitational field main article gravity of earth gravity measured by grace mission showing deviations from the theoretical gravity red shows where gravity is stronger than the smooth standard value and blue shows where it is weaker the gravity of earth is the acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the distribution of mass within the earth near the surface gravitational acceleration is approximately 2 2 local differences in topography geology and deeper tectonic structure cause local and broad regional differences in the gravitational field known as gravitational anomalies 168 magnetic field main article magnetic field the main part of magnetic field is generated in the core the site of a dynamo process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy the field extends outwards from the core through the mantle and up to surface where it is approximately a dipole the poles of the dipole are located close to geographic poles at the equator of the magnetic field the magnetic field strength at the surface is 3.05 10 t with global magnetic dipole moment of 7.91 10 15 t m 3 169 the convection movements in the core are chaotic the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment this causes secular variation of the main field and field reversals at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years the most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago 170 171 magnetosphere main article magnetosphere schematic of magnetosphere the solar wind flows from left to right the extent of magnetic field in space defines the magnetosphere ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere to about 10 earth radii and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail 172 because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind 173 charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere the plasmasphere is defined by low energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as earth rotates 174 175 the ring current is defined by medium energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field 176 and the van allen radiation belt are formed by high energy particles whose motion is essentially random but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere 172 177 during magnetic storms and substorms charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere and especially the magnetotail directed along field lines into ionosphere where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized causing the aurora 178 orbit and rotation rotation main article rotation rotation imaged by dscovr epic on 29 may 2016 a few weeks before the solstice rotation period relative to the mean solar 86,400 seconds of mean solar time 86,400.0025 si seconds 179 because solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal deceleration each day varies between 0 and 2 si ms longer 180 181 rotation period relative to the fixed stars called its stellar day by the international earth rotation and reference systems service iers is 86,164.0989 seconds of mean solar time ut1 or 23 h 56 m 4.0989 s 2 n 18 rotation period relative to the precessing or moving mean vernal equinox misnamed its sidereal day is 86,164.0905 seconds of mean solar time ut1 23 h 56 m 4.0905 s 2 thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 182 the length of the mean solar day in si seconds is available from the iers for the periods 183 and 184 apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low orbiting satellites the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in sky is to the west at a rate of for bodies near the celestial equator this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the sun or the moon every two minutes from surface the apparent sizes of the sun and the moon are approximately the same 185 186 orbit main article orbit the pale blue dot photo taken in 1990 by the voyager 1 spacecraft showing earth center right from nearly away earth orbits the sun at an average distance of about every 365.2564 mean solar days or one sidereal year this gives an apparent movement of the sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about which is one apparent sun or moon diameter every due to this motion on average it takes solar day earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the sun returns to the meridian the orbital speed of earth averages about which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to diameter about in seven minutes and the distance to the moon in about 3.5 hours 3 the moon and earth orbit a common barycenter every relative to the background stars when combined with the common orbit around the sun the period of the synodic month from new moon to new moon is viewed from the celestial north pole the motion of earth the moon and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the sun and earth earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the sun the orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned axis is tilted some from the perpendicular to the plane the ecliptic and the plane is tilted up to against the plane without this tilt there would be an eclipse every two weeks alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses 3 187 the hill sphere or the sphere of gravitational influence of the earth is about kilometres in radius 188 n 19 this is the maximum distance at which the gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant sun and planets objects must orbit the earth within this radius or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the sun earth along with the solar system is situated in the milky way and orbits about 28,000 light years from its center it is about above the galactic plane in the orion arm 189 axial tilt and seasons main article axial tilt axial tilt or obliquity and its relation to the rotation axis and plane of orbit the axial tilt of the earth is approximately 2 with the axis of its orbit plane always pointing towards the celestial poles due to axial tilt the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year this causes the seasonal change in climate with summer in the northern hemisphere occurring when the tropic of cancer is facing the sun and winter taking place when the tropic of capricorn in the southern hemisphere faces the sun during the summer the day lasts longer and the sun climbs higher in the sky in winter the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter in northern temperate latitudes the sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice and sets north of true west reversing in the winter the sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone and sets south of true west above the arctic circle an extreme case is reached where there is no daylight at all for part of the year up to six months at the north pole itself a polar night in the southern hemisphere the situation is exactly reversed with the south pole oriented opposite the direction of the north pole six months later this pole will experience a midnight sun a day of 24 hours again reversing with the south pole by astronomical convention the four seasons can be determined by the solstices points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the the equinoxes when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the sun are perpendicular in the northern hemisphere winter solstice currently occurs around 21 december summer solstice is near 21 june spring equinox is around 20 march and autumnal equinox is about 22 or 23 september in the southern hemisphere the situation is reversed with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped 190 the angle of axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time its axial tilt does undergo nutation a slight irregular motion with a main period of 191 the orientation rather than the angle of axis also changes over time precessing around in a complete circle over each cycle this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the sun and the moon on equatorial bulge the poles also migrate a few meters across surface this polar motion has multiple cyclical components which collectively are termed quasiperiodic motion in addition to an annual component to this motion there is a 14 month cycle called the chandler wobble rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length of day variation 192 in modern times perihelion occurs around 3 january and its aphelion around 4 july these dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors which follow cyclical patterns known as milankovitch cycles the changing distance causes an increase of about 6.9% n 20 in solar energy reaching earth at perihelion relative to aphelion because the southern hemisphere is tilted toward the sun at about the same time that earth reaches the closest approach to the sun the southern hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the sun than does the northern over the course of a year this effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the southern hemisphere 193 a study from 2016 suggested that planet nine tilted all solar system planets including by about 6 degrees 194 habitability the rocky mountains in canada overlook moraine lake a planet that can sustain life is termed habitable even if life did not originate there earth provides liquid environment where complex organic molecules can assemble and interact and sufficient energy to sustain metabolism 195 the distance of earth from the sun as well as its orbital eccentricity rate of rotation axial tilt geological history sustaining atmosphere and magnetic field all contribute to the current climatic conditions at the surface 196 biosphere main article biosphere a life forms inhabit ecosystems whose total is sometimes said to form a biosphere biosphere is thought to have begun evolving about 71 the biosphere is divided into a number of biomes inhabited by broadly similar plants and animals on land biomes are separated primarily by differences in latitude height above sea level and humidity terrestrial biomes lying within the arctic or antarctic circles at high altitudes or in extremely arid areas are relatively barren of plant and animal life species diversity reaches a peak in humid lowlands at equatorial latitudes 197 in july 2016 scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes from the last universal common ancestor luca of all organisms living on earth 198 natural resources and land use main articles natural resource and land use estimated human land use 2000 199 land use mha cropland pastures natural forests planted forests urban areas unused productive land earth has resources that have been exploited by humans those termed non renewable resources such as fossil fuels only renew over geological timescales large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from crust consisting of coal petroleum and natural gas these deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production mineral ore bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of ore genesis resulting from actions of magmatism erosion and plate tectonics 200 these bodies form concentrated sources for many metals and other useful elements biosphere produces many useful biological products for humans including food wood pharmaceuticals oxygen and the recycling of many organic wastes the land based ecosystem depends upon topsoil and fresh water and the oceanic ecosystem depends upon dissolved nutrients washed down from the land 201 in 1980 5,053 mha 50.53 million km 2 of land surface consisted of forest and woodlands 67.88 million km 2 was grasslands and pasture and 15.01 million km 2 was cultivated as croplands 202 the estimated amount of irrigated land in 1993 was 2,481,250 square kilometres 14 humans also live on the land by using building materials to construct shelters natural and environmental hazards a volcano injecting hot ash into the atmosphere large areas of surface are subject to extreme weather such as tropical cyclones hurricanes or typhoons that dominate life in those areas from 1980 to 2000 these events caused an average of 11,800 human deaths per year 203 many places are subject to earthquakes landslides tsunamis volcanic eruptions tornadoes sinkholes blizzards floods droughts wildfires and other calamities and disasters many localized areas are subject to human made pollution of the air and water acid rain and toxic substances loss of vegetation overgrazing deforestation desertification loss of wildlife species extinction soil degradation soil depletion and erosion there is a scientific consensus linking human activities to global warming due to industrial carbon dioxide emissions this is predicted to produce changes such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets more extreme temperature ranges significant changes in weather and a global rise in average sea levels 204 human geography main articles human geography and world the seven continents of earth 205 north

indicate that the human population will reach in 2050 207 most of the growth is expected to take place in developing nations human population density varies widely around the world but a majority live in asia by 2020 60% of the population is expected to be living in urban rather than rural areas 208 it is estimated that one eighth of surface is suitable for humans to live three quarters of surface

sovereign nations claim the entire land surface except for some parts of antarctica a few land parcels along the danube western bank and the unclaimed area of bir tawil between egypt and sudan as of 2015 update there are 193 sovereign states that are member states of the united nations plus two observer states and 72 dependent territories and states with limited recognition 14 earth has never had a sovereign government with authority over the entire globe although some nation states have striven for world domination and failed 212 the united nations is a worldwide intergovernmental organization that was created with the goal of intervening in the disputes between nations thereby avoiding armed conflict 213 the u n serves primarily as a forum for international diplomacy and international law when the consensus of the membership permits it provides a mechanism for armed intervention 214 the first human to orbit earth was yuri gagarin on 12 april 1961 215 in total about 487 people have visited outer space and reached orbit as of 30 july 2010 update and of these twelve have walked on the moon 216 217 218 normally the only humans in space are those on the international space station the crew made up of six people is usually replaced every six months 219 the farthest that humans have traveled from earth is achieved during the apollo 13 mission in 1970 220 moon characteristics diameter mass 7.349 10 22 kg semi major axis orbital period 27 d 7 h 43.7 m main article moon the moon is a relatively large terrestrial planet like natural satellite with a diameter about one quarter of it is the largest moon in the solar system relative to the size of its planet although charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet pluto the natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as moons after the gravitational attraction between earth and the moon causes tides on earth the same effect on the moon has led to its tidal locking its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit earth as a result it always presents the same face to the planet as the moon orbits earth different parts of its face are illuminated by the sun leading to the lunar phases the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the solar terminator details of the system showing the radius of each object and the barycenter the axis is located by third law due to their tidal interaction the moon recedes from earth at the rate of approximately over millions of years these tiny the lengthening of day by about 23 up to significant changes 221 during the devonian period for example approximately there were 400 days in a year with each day lasting 21.8 hours 222 the moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the climate paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the moon 28 some theorists think that without this stabilization against the torques applied by the sun and planets to equatorial bulge the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years as appears to be the case for mars 223 viewed from earth the moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent sized disk as the sun the angular size or solid angle of these two bodies match because although the diameter is about 400 times as large as the it is also 400 times more distant 186 this allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on earth the most widely accepted theory of the origin the giant impact hypothesis states that it formed from the collision of a mars size protoplanet called theia with the early earth this hypothesis explains among other things the relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of crust 224 asteroids and artificial satellites earth has at least five co orbital asteroids including 3753 cruithne and 2002 aa 29 225 226 a trojan asteroid companion 2010 tk 7 is librating around the leading lagrange triangular point l4 in the orbit around the sun 227 228 the tiny near earth asteroid 2006 rh 120 makes close approaches to the system roughly every twenty years during these approaches it can orbit earth for brief periods of time 229 as of june 2016 update there were 1,419 operational human made satellites orbiting earth 5 there are also inoperative satellites including vanguard 1 the oldest satellite currently in orbit and over 16,000 pieces of tracked space debris n 3 largest artificial satellite is the international space station cultural and historical viewpoint main article earth in culture earthrise taken by astronauts on board the standard astronomical symbol of earth consists of a cross circumscribed by a circle 230 representing the four corners of the world human cultures have developed many views of the planet earth is sometimes personified as a deity in many cultures it is a mother goddess that is also the primary fertility deity 231 and by the mid 20th century the gaia principle compared environments and life as a single self regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability 232 233 234 creation myths in many religions involve the creation of earth by a supernatural deity or deities 231 scientific investigation has resulted in several culturally transformative shifts in view of the planet in the west belief in a flat earth 235 was displaced by the idea of spherical earth credited to pythagoras in the 6th century bc 236 earth was further believed to be the center of the universe until the 16th century when scientists first theorized that it was a moving object comparable to the other planets in the solar system 237 due to the efforts of influential christian scholars and clerics such as james ussher who sought to determine the age of earth through analysis of genealogies in scripture westerners before the 19th century generally believed earth to be a few thousand years old at most it was only during the 19th century that geologists realized age was at least many millions of years 238 lord kelvin used thermodynamics to estimate the age of earth to be between 20 million and 400 million years in 1864 sparking a vigorous debate on the subject it was only when radioactivity and radioactive dating were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining age was established proving the planet to be billions of years old 239 240 the perception of earth shifted again in the 20th century when humans first viewed it from orbit and especially with photographs of earth returned by the apollo program 241 see also outline of earth celestial sphere earth
