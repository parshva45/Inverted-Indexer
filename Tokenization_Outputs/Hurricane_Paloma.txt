border situated along the southwestern edge of a ridge the depressed initially generally to the north northwest before turning north northeast within of formation favorable environmental conditions including low wind shear allowed for steady intensification following cyclogenesis 1 the hwrf and gfdl forecast models depicted rapid development of the depression into a major hurricane within five days before striking cuba 4 the former of which indicated a peak intensity of and 921 mbar hpa 27.20 inhg 5 the system acquired gale force winds early on at which time it was assigned the name paloma

became defined on visible satellite imagery that evening rapid strengthening ensued once more 1 8 a localized area of high ocean heat content bolstered this phase 9 aided by increasing divergence from

displayed a well defined eye surrounded by intense convection estimated at to to 9 late on environmental conditions abruptly became hostile as the hurricane approached cuba interaction with land hastened weakening with convection diminishing significantly the northern eyewall moved ashore around while the center itself made landfall at on near santa cruz del sur upon moving ashore paloma was estimated to have had winds of making it a 1 within hours of moving ashore the center decoupled from the remaining convection and its forward speed slowed significantly 15 the system subsequently degraded to a tropical depression by just after being a with no convection redeveloping as the system drifted northward over cuba paloma degenerated into a remnant low six hours later the low then briefly moved over the atlantic ocean before doubling back to the southwest in response to a building ridge farther north the system crossed cuba again and re emerged over the caribbean sea by changing direction this time to the west and later northwest after crossing western cuba early on the remnants of paloma entered the gulf of mexico accelerating northward the low became decreasingly organized and ultimately dissipated early the next day about south southwest of apalachicola florida 1 later on the system moved inland over the florida panhandle where a sudden burst of convective
