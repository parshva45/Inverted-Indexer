khrunichev state research and production space center 3 in russian is a moscow based producer of spacecraft and space launch systems including the proton and rokot rockets the history dates back to 1916 when an automobile factory was established outside moscow it soon switched production to airplanes and during world war ii produced ilyushin il 4 and tupolev tu 2 bombers a design bureau okb 23 was added to the company in 1951 in 1959 the company started developing intercontinental ballistic missiles and later spacecraft and space launch vehicles the company designed and produced all soviet space stations including mir okb 23 renamed to salyut design bureau became an independent company in 1988 in 1993 the khrunichev plant and the salyut design bureau were joined again to form khrunichev state research and production space center in the 1990s the company entered the international launch services joint venture to market launches on its proton rocket khrunichev subsequently became a successful launch service provider on the international space launch market the company currently has an over 30% market share of the global space launch market and its revenue from commercial space launches in 2009 was $584 million 4 current number of employees about 35,000 it is named after mikhail khrunichev a soviet minister contents 1 history 1.1 beginnings 1.2 soviet era 1.3 post 1991

moscow the first cars of the russo balt brand were produced there in 1922 the next year the factory switched to producing ju 20 and ju 21 aircraft for the german company junkers the development of a russian aircraft industry started soon after during world war ii the plant produced russian designed ilyushin il 4 and tu 2 long range bombers this factory later became the khrunichev machine building plant 5 6 soviet era edit main article myasishchev in 1951 the experimental design bureau no 23 okb 23 headed by v myasishchev was created and added to khrunichev in the 1950s it designed the myasishchev m 4 myasishchev m 50 and myasishchev m 52 planes among others the khrunichev plant was responsible for manufacturing okb 23 designs 5 6 in 1959 the focus switched from aircraft to rocket technology in accordange with a government decision in the 1960s khrunichev and okb 23 were subordinated to vladimir chelomey s okb 52 later renamed to tskbm today npo mashinostroyeniya under the okb 52 leadership okb 23 started to design intercontinental ballistic missiles its first designs were the ur 200 which never flew followed by the successful ur 100 family of missiles in 1962 the design process of the ur 500 super heavy icbm was started this later evolved into the proton space launch vehicle in 1964 the first proton rocket was launched on 16 july 1965 6 7 in 1966 okb 52 was renamed the central design bureau of machine building tskbm and okb 23 became known as the fili branch of tskbm it was split off from tskbm in the late 1970s and renamed the salyut design bureau or kb salyut for short in kb salyut was part of the large npo energiya company and become an independent design bureau in 1988 the partnership with khrunichev machine building plant continued through all this time 6 kb salyut and khrunichev were responsible for designing and producing all soviet space stations including salyut almaz and mir as well as every heavy weight module used for these stations 8 post 1991 adjustments edit entrance to khrunichev state research and production space center in moscow the dissolution of the soviet union resulted in great difficulties for the russian space industry over the years the space budget dropped by 88% 9 and established production cooperation chains disintegrated both khrunichev and the salyut design bureau which were now separate companies attempted to remedy the situation by seeking earning possibilities abroad salyut managed to win a contract for producing the 12krb booster for the indian gslv rocket and entered an agreement with daimler benz aerospace to develop a recoverable capsule used for experiments in the german japanese express project 10 at this time the proton launch vehicle proved as the most profitable product for both companies the khrunichev plant signed a $156 million contract to launch 21 iridium satellites on three proton k rockets in 1997-1998 salyut managed to sign only one contract for launching the inmarsat 3 f satellite with proton k at the low price of $36 million both companies attempted to enter partnerships with foreign companies to market proton launches 10 the situation where two companies the design bureau and the factory competed with each other to sell the same product proved problematic to solve this on 7 june 1993 president of russia boris yeltsin issued a decree to merge khrunichev and salyut forming the company khrunichev state research and production space center the new status was unique in that it was not subordinate to any ministries or to the russian space agency vladimir kirillov writing for the eksport vooruzheniy journal speculates that this was because daughter tatyana dyachenko who had worked at salyut and continued to work for khrunichev until 1994 wished to secure a high status for her employer 10 success on the international launch market edit international launch service logo on 15 april 1993 khrunichev had created the lockheed khrunichev energia joint venture with the american company lockheed and in 1995 due to the merger of lockheed and martin marietta it was transformed into international launch services ils the joint venture marketed launches on both the proton and the american atlas rockets the united states had given permission for the appearance of proton on the international launch market but introduced a quota to protect the launch market from russian dumping despite this the proton built by khrunichev was successful and by the end of 2000 had earned launch contracts worth over $1.5 billion 10 the income from commercial launch contracts and investments from lockheed enabled khrunichev to conduct a serious upgrade of its facilities this included an upgrade of the launch facilities in baikonur for which several hundred million dollars were invested the commercial earnings also allowed the company to develop new launch vehicles boosters and spacecraft on its own without government support 10 since its creation international launch services has signed contracts for more than 100 launches valued at more than $8 billion 11 in 1998 khrunichev was made subordinate to the russian space agency then called rosaviakosmos khrunichev resisted the move for a long time and managed to prevent the agency from installing its own leadership in the company 10 one disadvantage for khrunichev was that the blok dm upper stage used by proton was manufactured by the company rsc energia and khrunichev had to pay 40% of its launch revenue for its usage due to this in 1996-1998 khrunichev started the development of its own upper stage called the briz km partly because of funding difficulties the development process was slow 10 and briz km experienced several failures in its early days after a briz m failure prevented the amc 14 satellite from reaching its designated orbit several modifications were made in this upper stage 12 13 integration programme edit in the 2000s khrunichev entered a vertical integration programme to bring its principal suppliers under a single management for this purpose khrunichev absorbed the following companies 4 po polyot a rocket manufacturer located in omsk proton pm an engine maker located in perm voronezh mechanical plant which manufactures engines for proton stages ii and iii soyuz stage iii and zenit upper stage kbkhm manufacturer of propulsion systems for the breeze upper stage located in korolyov kbkha a contractor for production and design issues located in voronezh as of 2010 the integration had resulted in the share of in house production for proton and the breeze upper stage rising from 30% to 65% of the product value 4 structure edit companies of the khrunichev space center 14 salyut design bureau space rocket plant space hardware operation plant zerkt armatura design bureau khrunichev telecom space systems research and development institute medical equipment and consumer goods division voronezh mechanical plant polyot production corporation isayev chemical engineering design bureau ust katav carriage plant named for s m kirov ukvz production edit proton rocket manufactured by khrunichev main product is the proton rocket which has been launched more than 350 times since its creation in 1968 latest version of the venerable rocket which has been subject to several incremental upgrades is proton m enhanced it has a lifting capability of 6 150kg to geostationary transfer orbit for use as upper stage khrunichev produces briz m which first flew in 2000 rockot a converted ballistic missile is offered for launching smaller payloads for international marketing of rockot launches khrunichev has created the joint venture eurockot gmbh another version of the briz m upper stage briz km is used as third stage in 2009 the company manufactured a total of 25 launch vehicles upper stage boosters and spacecraft while in 2005 the figure was 11 in 2010 khrunichev aims to raise the figure to 30 4 a record 15 rockets were launched by the company in 2009 in 2008 the company was responsible for lofting every third kilogram of the combined satellite payload 4 revenue edit revenue from commercial launches not including launches for the ministry of defense in 2009 was $584 considerably from the $198 million figure in 2004 since 1994 proton has earned $4.3 billion for the russian space industry as a whole and in 2011 this figure is expected to raise to $6 billion 4 in 2006-2009 investments in modernization and retooling amounted to rub 2.6 billion angara rocket family edit since 1995 khrunichev has been developing the angara rocket family the main purpose of angara is to ensure independent access to space as the rockets can be launched from the plesetsk cosmodrome in northern russia as well as the upcoming vostochny cosmodrome instead of having to rely on baikonur cosmodrome which is located on the territory of kazakhstan angara also does not use the toxic fuel that is used by proton the angara programme has been hit by several delays state funding started to reach appropriate levels only in 2005 in 2009 it was estimated that angara had 95-97% completion rate over all major program indicators the main stumbling block is the construction of the new launch pad in plesetsk due to unrealistic deflator indices set by the ministry of defense khrunichev has not received enough money to order all necessary equipment for finishing the pad pushing expected first flight to 2013 when completed the angara rockets are intended to replace several existing launchers including proton 4 list
