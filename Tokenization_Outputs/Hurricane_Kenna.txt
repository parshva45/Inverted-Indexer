began late on october 20 early on october 22 the system developed into tropical depression fourteen e while located about south of manzanillo colima 1 initially the depression was disorganized with little inner convective structure and sporadic deep convection computer models predicted an increase in wind shear by as such the national hurricane center forecast the depression to strengthen to a peak strength of before weakening 2 the depression quickly became better organized with a great increase in convection near the center and six hours after forming it strengthened into tropical storm kenna upper level outflow and banding features improved in organization as well with warm water temperatures of over and updated model forecasts anticipating light amounts of vertical wind shear forecasters predicted kenna to slowly intensify to reach winds of within of october 22 3 the storm moved to the west northwest around the periphery of a mid level high pressure system and initially

fourth lowest recorded pressure for a pacific hurricane 5 6 quickly after peaking wind shear from the approaching trough weakened the hurricane and by six hours after reaching peak intensity the winds in hurricane kenna dropped to after the eye nearly dissipated despite a 27 mbar increase in pressure in convective activity increased prior to kenna making landfall on october 25 hurricane kenna
