of the 2015 atlantic hurricane season joaquin evolved from a non tropical low to become a tropical depression on september 28 well southwest of bermuda tempered by unfavorable wind shear the depression drifted southwestward after becoming a tropical storm the next day joaquin underwent rapid intensification reaching hurricane status on september 30 and category 4 major hurricane strength on october 1 meandering over the southern bahamas eye passed near or over several islands on october 3 the hurricane weakened somewhat and accelerated to the northeast abrupt re intensification ensued later that day and joaquin acquired sustained winds of just short of category 5 strength hurricane warnings were hoisted across most of the bahamas as the hurricane threatened the country battering the southern islands for over two days joaquin caused extensive devastation most notably on acklins crooked island long island rum cay and san salvador island severe storm surge inundated many communities trapping hundreds of people in their homes flooding persisted for days after the departure prolonged intense winds brought down trees and powerlines and unroofed homes throughout the

affect the nation offshore the american cargo ship el faro and her 33 members were lost to the hurricane coastal flooding also impacted the nearby turks and caicos washing out roadways compromising seawalls and damaging homes strong winds and heavy rainfall caused some property damage in eastern cuba one fisherman died when heavy seas capsized a small boat along the coast of haiti storm tides resulted in severe flooding in several departments of haiti forcing families from their homes and destroying crops the weakening hurricane passed just west of bermuda on october 4 attended by strong

offshore death toll for any atlantic hurricane since the escuminac hurricane in 1959 which killed 35 people in the northumberland strait 4 although joaquin never directly affected the united states

edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the scale on september 25 2015 the us national hurricane center nhc began monitoring an upper level low accompanied by a surface trough several hundred miles south southwest of bermuda for possible tropical cyclogenesis 5 the system gradually consolidated as it drifted north northwest acquiring a closed surface low late on september 26 6 convective showers and thunderstorms steadily increased on september 27 and at 03 00 utc on september 28 the nhc assessed the system to have become a tropical depression situated roughly southwest of bermuda 7 8 9 although the depression featured a well defined low strong wind shear displaced convection and exposed the circulation a ridge to the north was forecast to steer the system slowly northwest into a region of higher shear meteorologists at the nhc initially depicted the system dissipating within based on modeling depictions 8 convection developed and persisted closer to the circulation centre throughout september 28 10 and early on september 29 dvorak satellite classifications indicated the system became a tropical storm accordingly it was assigned the name joaquin becoming the tenth named storm of the season 11 12 hurricane joaquin meandering around the bahamas on october 2 note the system to its north which produced heavy rainfall over the carolinas strengthening of the mid level ridge prompted a sudden shift in trajectory to the southwest directing it towards the bahamas 11 13 forecasters at the nhc noted considerable uncertainty in the future of joaquin with forecast models depicting a wide range of possibilities 14 throughout september 29 the storm steadily intensified as its circulation became embedded within deep convection and upper level outflow became increasingly prominent 15 high sea surface temperatures and decreasing shear aided strengthening and early on september 30 the storm achieved hurricane status 16 17 rapid intensification ensued thereafter with an eye developing within a symmetric central dense overcast data from aircraft reconnaissance indicated that joaquin reached status on the hurricane wind scale by on october 1 18 around the eye of joaquin passed over samana cay bahamas with winds of making it a hurricane 19 around this same time its eye contracted from 41 to 66 to in diameter representing

previously steering joaquin southwest began retreating north the movement slowed and shifted west and later north early on october 2 24 25 an eyewall replacement cycle process whereby a second larger eye develops while the inner eye that morning 26 its eye became increasingly ill defined in satellite imagery 25 slight weakening took place accordingly 27 and the hurricane passed over rum cay and san salvador island around and as a strong hurricane with winds of 19 a pressure near hpa was observed on san salvador island 28 an amplifying trough over the southeastern united states enhanced southwesterly flow over joaquin on october 3 and prompted the hurricane to accelerate northeast away from the bahamas 29 throughout the day the eye became increasingly defined and re intensification ensued 30 aircraft reconnaissance found a considerably stronger system that afternoon based on flight level winds of it is estimated that joaquin attained surface winds of high end 31 this made joaquin the strongest atlantic hurricane of non tropical origin in the satellite era 19 goes satellite animation of hurricane joaquin from to shortly after peaking the overall structure began to deteriorate signalling a weakening trend 32 on october 4 the storm curved towards the north northeast between a large low pressure system to its west and a mid level ridge to its east 33 as deep convection over its core continued to wane 34 joaquin passed about west northwest of bermuda near 00 00 utc on october 5 with winds of 19 the weakening trend slowed that day as the satellite presentation improved slightly marked by brief reappearances of a distinct eye feature joaquin gradually turned northeastward around the periphery of the weak ridge and subsequently accelerated toward the east northeast as it entered the prevailing westerlies 35 the system maintained hurricane intensity until 15 00 utc on october 7 by which point strengthening wind shear and an increasingly colder environment began to take their toll 36 the cloud pattern became lopsided as colder drier air infiltrated the circulation forming the first stages of a frontal structure 37 with its extratropical transition well underway joaquin lost its identity as a tropical cyclone at 03 00 utc on october 8 about southeast of cape race newfoundland 38 during the next several days extratropical remnant
