states located between the atlantic coast and the appalachian mountains virginia is nicknamed the old dominion due to its status as the first english colonial possession established in mainland north america 8 and mother of presidents because eight u s presidents were born there more than any other state the geography and climate of the commonwealth are shaped by the blue ridge mountains and the chesapeake bay which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna the capital of the commonwealth is richmond virginia beach is the most populous city and fairfax county is the most populous political subdivision the estimated population as of 2017 update is over 8.4 million 2 the history begins with several indigenous groups including the powhatan in 1607 the london company established the colony of virginia as the first permanent new world english colony slave labor and the land acquired from displaced native american tribes each played a significant role in the early politics and plantation economy virginia was one of the 13 colonies in the american revolution and joined the confederacy in the american civil war during which richmond was made the confederate capital and northwestern counties seceded to form the state of west virginia although the commonwealth was under one party rule for nearly a century following reconstruction both major national parties are

area of 42,774.2 square miles 2 including 3,180.13 square miles 2 of water making it the 35th largest state by area 13 virginia is bordered by maryland and washington d c to the north and east by the atlantic ocean to the east by north carolina to the south by tennessee to the southwest by kentucky to the west and by west virginia to the north and west boundary with maryland and washington d c extends to the low water mark of the south shore of the potomac river 14 the southern border is defined as the parallel north though surveyor error led to deviations of as much as three arcminutes 15 the border with tennessee was not settled until 1893 when their dispute was brought to the u s supreme court 16 geology and terrain the chesapeake bay separates the contiguous portion of the commonwealth from the two county peninsula of eastern shore the bay was formed from the drowned river valleys of the susquehanna river and the james river 17 many of rivers flow into the chesapeake bay including the potomac rappahannock york and james which create three peninsulas in the bay 18 19 deciduous and evergreen trees give the blue ridge mountains their distinct color 20 the tidewater is a coastal plain between the atlantic coast and the fall line it includes the eastern shore and major estuaries of chesapeake bay the piedmont is a series of sedimentary and igneous rock based foothills east of the mountains which were formed in the mesozoic era 21 the region known for its heavy clay soil includes the southwest mountains around charlottesville 22 the blue ridge mountains are a physiographic province of the appalachian mountains with the highest points in the state the tallest being mount rogers at 5,729 feet 23 the ridge and valley region is west of the mountains and includes the great appalachian valley the region is carbonate rock based and includes massanutten mountain 24 the cumberland plateau and the cumberland mountains are in the southwest corner of virginia south of the allegheny plateau in this region rivers flow northwest with a dendritic drainage system into the ohio river basin 25 the virginia seismic zone has not had a history of regular earthquake activity earthquakes are rarely above magnitude because virginia is located away from the edges of the north american plate the largest earthquake at an estimated was in 1897 near blacksburg 26 a 5.8 magnitude earthquake struck central virginia on august 23 2011 near mineral the earthquake was reportedly felt as far away as toronto atlanta and florida 27 coal mining takes place in the three mountainous regions at 45 distinct coal beds near mesozoic basins 28 over 62 million tons of other non fuel resources such as slate kyanite sand or gravel were also mined in virginia in 2012 29 the carbonate rock is filled with more than 4,000 caves ten of which are open for tourism 30 35 million years ago a bolide impacted what is now eastern virginia the resulting crater may

climate of virginia is humid subtropical and becomes increasingly warmer and more humid farther south and east 32 seasonal extremes vary from average lows of in january to average highs of in july the atlantic ocean has a strong effect on eastern and southeastern coastal areas of the state influenced by the gulf stream coastal weather is subject to hurricanes most pronouncedly near the mouth of chesapeake bay 33 in spite of its position adjacent to the atlantic ocean even the coastal areas have a significant continental influence with quite large temperature differences between summer and winter particularly given the state subtropical classification which is typical of states in the upper south virginia has an annual average of days of thunderstorm activity particularly in the western part of the state 34 and an average annual precipitation of 42.7 inches 33 cold air masses arriving over the mountains in winter can lead to significant snowfalls such as the blizzard of 1996 and winter storms of the interaction of these elements with the topography creates distinct microclimates in the shenandoah valley the mountainous southwest and the coastal plains 35 virginia averages seven tornadoes annually most f2 or lower on the fujita scale 36 in recent years the expansion of the southern suburbs of washington d c into northern virginia has introduced an urban heat island primarily caused by increased absorption of solar radiation in more densely populated areas 37 in the american lung association s 2011 report 11 counties received failing grades for air quality with fairfax county having the worst in the state due to automobile pollution 38 39 haze in the mountains is caused in part by coal power plants 40 ecosystem see also list of endangered species in virginia forests cover 65% of the state primarily with deciduous broad leaf trees in the western part of the state and evergreens and conifers dominant the central and eastern part of virginia 41 lower altitudes are more likely to have small but dense stands of moisture loving hemlocks and mosses in abundance with hickory and oak in the blue ridge 32 however since the early 1990s gypsy moth infestations have eroded the dominance of oak forests 42 in the lowland tidewater and piedmont yellow pines tend to dominate with bald cypress wetland forests in the great dismal and nottoway swamps other common trees and plants include red bay wax myrtle dwarf palmetto tulip poplar mountain laurel milkweed daisies and many species of ferns the largest areas of wilderness are along the atlantic coast and in the western mountains where the largest populations of trillium wildflowers in north america are found 32 43 the atlantic coast regions are host to flora commonly associated with the south atlantic pine forests and lower southeast coastal plain maritime flora the latter found primarily in eastern and central virginia white tailed deer also known as virginia deer graze at big meadows in shenandoah national park mammals include white tailed deer black bear beaver bobcat coyote raccoon skunk groundhog virginia opossum gray fox red fox and eastern cottontail rabbit 44 other

department of conservation and recreation and the department of forestry 41 50 the chesapeake bay while not a national park is protected by both state and federal legislation and the jointly run chesapeake bay program which conducts restoration on the bay and its watershed the great dismal swamp national wildlife refuge extends into north carolina as does the back bay national wildlife refuge which marks the beginning of the outer banks 51 history main article history of virginia the story of pocahontas an ancestress of many of the first families of virginia was romanticized by later artists 52 jamestown 2007 marked quadricentennial year celebrating 400 years since the establishment of the jamestown colony the celebrations highlighted contributions from native americans africans and europeans each of which had a significant part in shaping history 53 54 warfare including among these groups has also had an important role virginia was a focal point in conflicts from the french and indian war the american revolution and the civil war to the cold war and the war on terrorism 55 stories about historic figures such as those surrounding pocahontas and john smith george washington s childhood or the plantation elite in the slave society of the antebellum period have also created potent myths of state history and have served as rationales for ideology 56 colony main article colony of virginia the first people are estimated to have arrived in virginia over ago 57 by 5,000 years ago more permanent settlements emerged and farming began by 900 ad by 1500 the algonquian peoples had founded towns such as werowocomoco in the tidewater region which they referred to as tsenacommacah the other major language groups in the area were the siouan to the west and the iroquoians who included the nottoway and meherrin to the north and south after 1570 the algonquians consolidated under chief powhatan in response to threats from these other groups on their trade network 58 powhatan controlled more than tribes and over who shared a common virginia algonquian language in 1607 the native tidewater population was between 13,000 and 14,000 59 several european expeditions including a group of spanish jesuits explored the chesapeake bay during the 16th century 60 in 1583 queen elizabeth i of england granted walter raleigh a charter to plant a colony north of spanish florida 61 in 1584 raleigh sent an expedition to the atlantic coast of north america 62 the name virginia may have been suggested then by raleigh or elizabeth perhaps noting her status as the virgin queen and may also be related to a native phrase wingandacoa or name wingina 63 initially the name applied to the entire coastal region from south carolina to maine plus the island of bermuda 64 later subsequent royal charters modified the boundaries the london company was incorporated as a joint stock company by the proprietary charter of 1606 which granted land rights to this area the company financed the first permanent english settlement in the new world jamestown named for king james i it was founded in may 1607 by christopher newport 65 in 1619 colonists took greater control with an elected legislature called the house of burgesses with the bankruptcy of the london company in 1624 the settlement was taken into royal authority as an english crown colony 66 williamsburg was capital from 1699 to 1780 life in the colony was perilous and many died during the starving time in 1609 and the anglo powhatan wars including the indian massacre of 1622 which fostered the colonists negative view of all tribes 67 by 1624 only the settlers had survived 68 however european demand for tobacco fueled the arrival of more settlers and servants 69 the headright system tried to solve the labor shortage by providing colonists with land for each indentured servant they transported to virginia 70 african workers were first imported to jamestown in 1619 initially under the rules of indentured servitude the shift to a system of african slavery in virginia was propelled by the legal cases of john punch who was sentenced to lifetime slavery in 1640 for attempting to run away 71 and of john casor who was claimed by anthony johnson as his servant for life in 1655 72 slavery first appears in virginia statutes in 1661 and 1662 when a law made it hereditary based on the status 73 tensions and the geographic differences between the working and ruling classes led to rebellion in 1676 by which time current and former indentured servants made up as much as 80% of the population 74 rebels largely from the frontier were also opposed to the conciliatory policy towards native tribes and one result of the rebellion was the signing at middle plantation of the treaty of 1677 which made the signatory tribes tributary states and was part of a pattern of appropriating tribal land by force and treaty middle plantation saw the founding of the college of william mary in 1693 and was renamed williamsburg as it became the colonial capital in 1699 75 in 1747 a group of virginian speculators formed the ohio company with the backing of the british crown to start english settlement and trade in the ohio country west of the appalachian mountains 76 france which claimed this area as part of their colony of new france viewed this as a threat and the ensuing french and indian war became part of the seven years war a militia from several british colonies called the virginia regiment was led by then lieutenant colonel george washington 77 statehood 1851 painting of patrick henry s speech before the house of burgesses on the virginia resolves against the stamp act of 1765 the british efforts to levy new taxes following the french and indian war were deeply unpopular in the colonies in the house of burgesses opposition to taxation without representation was led by patrick henry and richard henry lee among others 78 virginians began to coordinate their actions with other colonies in 1773 and sent delegates to the continental congress the following year 79 after the house of burgesses was dissolved by the royal governor in 1774 revolutionary leaders continued to govern via the virginia conventions on may 15 1776 the convention declared independence from the british empire and adopted george mason s virginia declaration of rights which was then included in a new constitution 80 another virginian thomas jefferson drew upon work in drafting the national declaration of independence 81 when the american revolutionary war began george washington was selected to head the colonial army during the war the capital was moved to richmond at the urging of governor thomas jefferson who feared that coastal location would make it vulnerable to british attack 82 in 1781 the combined action of continental and french land and naval forces trapped the british army on the virginia peninsula where troops under george washington and comte de rochambeau defeated british general cornwallis in the siege of yorktown his surrender on october 19 1781 led to peace negotiations in paris and secured the independence of the colonies 83 virginians were instrumental in writing the united states constitution james madison drafted the virginia plan in 1787 and the bill of rights in 1789 81 virginia ratified the constitution on june 25 1788 the three fifths compromise ensured that virginia with its large number of slaves initially had the largest bloc in the house of representatives together with the virginia dynasty of presidents this gave the commonwealth national importance in 1790 both virginia and maryland ceded territory to form the new district of columbia though the virginian area was retroceded in 1846 84 virginia is called mother of states because of its role in being carved into states like kentucky which became the 15th state in 1792 and for the numbers of american pioneers born in virginia 85 civil war and aftermath main article virginia in the american civil war union soldiers before heights fredericksburg in may 1863 in addition to agriculture slave labor was increasingly used in mining shipbuilding and other industries 86 the execution of gabriel prosser in 1800 nat slave rebellion in 1831 and john raid on harpers ferry in 1859 marked the growing social discontent over slavery and its role in the plantation economy by 1860 almost half a million people roughly 31% of the total population of virginia were enslaved 87 88 this division contributed to the start of the american civil war virginia voted to secede from the united states on april 17 1861 after the battle of fort sumter and abraham lincoln s call for volunteers on april 24 virginia joined the confederate states of america which chose richmond as its capital 85 after the 1861 wheeling convention 48 counties in the northwest separated to form a new state of west virginia which chose to remain loyal to the union virginian general robert e lee took command of the army of northern virginia in 1862 and led invasions into union territory ultimately becoming commander of all confederate forces during the war more battles were fought in virginia than anywhere else including bull run the seven days battles chancellorsville and the concluding battle of appomattox court house 89 after the capture of richmond in april 1865 the state capital was briefly moved to lynchburg 90 while the confederate leadership fled to danville 91 virginia was formally restored to the united states in 1870 due to the work of the committee of nine 92 during the post war reconstruction era virginia adopted a constitution which provided for free public schools and guaranteed political civil and voting rights 93 the populist readjuster party ran an inclusive coalition until the conservative white democratic party gained power after 1883 94 it passed segregationist jim crow laws and in 1902 rewrote the constitution of virginia to include a poll tax and other voter registration measures that effectively disfranchised most african americans and many poor european americans 95 though their schools and public services were segregated and underfunded due to a lack of political representation african americans were able to unite in communities and take a greater role in virginia society 96 post reconstruction many pre dreadnought and world war i era warships were built in newport news including the uss virginia new economic forces also changed the commonwealth virginian james albert bonsack invented the tobacco cigarette rolling machine in 1880 leading to new industrial scale production centered on richmond in 1886 railroad magnate collis potter huntington founded newport news shipbuilding which was responsible for building six major world war i era battleships for the u s navy from 1907 to 1923 97 during the war german submarines like u 151 attacked ships outside the port 98 in 1926 dr w a r goodwin rector of bruton parish church began restoration of colonial era buildings in the historic district with financial backing of john d rockefeller jr 99 though their project like others in the state had to contend with the great depression and world war ii work continued as colonial williamsburg became a major tourist attraction 100 the virginia civil rights memorial was erected in 2008 to commemorate the protests which led to school desegregation protests started by barbara rose johns in 1951 in farmville against segregated schools led to the lawsuit davis v county school board of prince edward county this case filed by richmond natives spottswood robinson and oliver hill was decided in 1954 with brown v board of education which rejected the segregationist doctrine of separate but equal but in 1958 under the policy of massive resistance led by the influential segregationist senator harry f byrd and his byrd organization the commonwealth prohibited desegregated local schools from receiving state funding 101 the civil rights movement gained many participants in the 1960s it achieved the moral force and support to gain passage of national legislation with the civil rights act of 1964 and the voting rights act of 1965 in 1964 the united states supreme court ordered prince edward county and others to integrate schools 102 in 1967 the court also struck down the ban on interracial marriage with loving v virginia from 1969 to 1971 state legislators under governor mills godwin rewrote the constitution after goals such as the repeal of jim crow laws had been achieved in 1989 douglas wilder became the first african american elected as governor in the united states 103 the cold war led to the expansion of national defense government programs housed in offices in northern virginia near washington d c and correlative population growth 104 the central intelligence agency in langley was involved in various cold war events including as the target of soviet espionage activities also among the federal developments was the pentagon built during world war ii as the headquarters for the department of defense it was one of the targets of the september 11 attacks 189 people died at the site when a jet
