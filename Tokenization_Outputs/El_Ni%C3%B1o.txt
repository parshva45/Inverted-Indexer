el wikipedia el from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search for other uses see el disambiguation the el observed by topex poseidon the white areas indicate the pool of warm water off the tropical western coasts of northern south and all central america as well as along the central eastern equatorial and southeastern pacific ocean 1 el l n nj spanish pronunciation el is the warm phase of the el southern oscillation commonly called enso and is associated with a band of warm ocean water that develops in the central and east central equatorial pacific between approximately the international date line and including off the pacific coast of south america el southern oscillation refers to the cycle of warm and cold temperatures as measured by sea surface temperature sst of the tropical central and eastern pacific ocean el is accompanied by high air pressure in the western pacific and low air pressure in the eastern pacific the cool phase of enso is called la with sst in the eastern pacific below average and air pressures high in the eastern and low in western pacific the enso cycle both el and la cause global changes of both temperatures and rainfall 2 3 developing countries that are dependent upon agriculture and fishing particularly those bordering the pacific ocean are usually most affected in american spanish the capitalized term el refers to the little boy so named because the pool of warm water in the pacific near south america is often at its warmest around christmas 4 the original name el de navidad traces its origin centuries back to peruvian fishermen who named the weather phenomenon in reference to the newborn christ 5 6 la chosen as the opposite of el literally translates to the little girl contents 1 concept 2 occurrences 3 cultural

external links concept edit originally the term el applied to an annual weak warm ocean current that ran southwards along the coast of peru and ecuador at about christmas time 7 however over time the term has evolved and now refers to the warm and negative phase of the el southern oscillation and is the warming of the ocean surface or above average sea surface temperatures in either the central and eastern tropical pacific ocean 8 9 this warming causes a shift in the atmospheric circulation with rainfall becoming reduced over indonesia and australia while rainfall and tropical cyclone formation increases over the tropical pacific ocean 10 the low level surface trade winds which normally blow from east to west along the equator either weaken or start blowing from the other direction 9 map showing and other index regions historically el events are thought to have been occurring for thousands of years 11 for example it is thought that el affected the inca empire in modern day peru who sacrificed humans in order to try to prevent the rains 11 scientists have also found the chemical signatures of warmer sea surface temperatures and increased rainfall caused by el in coral specimens that are around old 12 in around 1525 when francisco pizarro made landfall on peru he noted rainfall occurring in the deserts which subsequently became the first written record of the impacts of el 12 modern day research and reanalysis techniques have managed to find at least 26 el events since 1900 with the 1982-83 and events among the strongest on record 13 14 15 currently each country has a different threshold for what constitutes an el event which is tailored to their specific interests 16 for example the australian bureau of meteorology looks at the trade winds soi weather models and sea surface temperatures in the nino 3 and 3.4 regions before declaring an el 17 the united states climate prediction center cpc and the international research institute for climate and society iri looks at the sea surface temperatures in the nino 3.4 region the tropical pacific atmosphere and forecasts that oceanic index will equal or exceed for several seasons in a row 18 however the japan meteorological agency declares that an el event has started when the average 5 month sea surface temperature deviation for the nino 3 region is over warmer for 6 consecutive months or longer 19 the peruvian government declares that a coastal el nino is under way if the sea surface temperatures in the nino 1 and 2 regions equal or exceed for at least 3 months there is no consensus on if climate change will have any influence on the occurrence strength or duration of el events as research supports el events becoming stronger longer shorter and weaker 20 21 occurrences edit a timeline of all the el episodes between 1900 and 2016 13 14 el events are thought to have been occurring for thousands of years 11 for example it is thought that el affected the inca empire in modern day peru who sacrificed humans in order to try and prevent the rains 11 it is thought that there have been at least 30 el events since 1900 with the 1982-83 and events among the strongest on record 13 14 since 2000 el events have been observed in and 13 major enso events were recorded in the years 1828 1891 and 22 23 24 verification needed needs update typically this anomaly happens at irregular intervals of two to seven years and lasts nine months to two years 25 the average period length is five years when this warming occurs for seven to nine months it is classified as el conditions when its duration is longer it is classified as an el episode 26 there is no consensus on whether climate change will have any influence on the occurrence strength or duration of el events as research supports el events becoming stronger longer shorter and weaker 20 21 during strong el episodes a secondary peak in sea surface temperature across the far eastern equatorial pacific ocean sometimes follows the initial peak 27 cultural history and prehistoric information edit average equatorial pacific temperatures enso conditions have occurred at two to seven year intervals for at least the past 300 years but most of them have been weak evidence is also strong for el events during the early holocene epoch 10,000 years ago 28 el may have led to the demise of the moche and other pre columbian peruvian cultures 29 a recent study suggests a strong effect between 1789 and 1793 caused poor crop yields in europe which in turn helped touch off the french revolution 30 the extreme weather produced by el in gave rise to the most deadly famines of the 19th century 31 the 1876 famine alone in northern china killed up to 13 million people 32 an early recorded mention of the term el to refer to climate occurred in 1892 when captain camilo carrillo told the geographical society congress in lima that peruvian sailors named the warm north flowing current el because it was most noticeable around christmas 33 the phenomenon had long been of interest because of its effects on the guano industry and other enterprises that depend on biological productivity of the sea charles todd in 1888 suggested droughts in india and australia tended to occur at the same time 34 norman lockyer noted the same in 1904 35 an el connection with flooding was reported in 1894 by eguiguren es and in 1895 by federico alfonso pezet 36 37 in 1924 gilbert walker for whom the walker circulation is named coined the term southern oscillation 38 he and others including norwegian american meteorologist jacob bjerknes are generally credited with identifying the el effect 39 the major el led to an upsurge of interest from the scientific community the period was unusual in that el have rarely occurred in such rapid succession 40 an especially intense el event in 1998 caused an estimated 16% of the reef systems to die the event temporarily warmed air temperature by compared to the usual increase of associated with el events 41 since then mass coral bleaching has become common worldwide with all regions having suffered severe bleaching 42 diversity edit map showing and other index regions it is thought that there are several different types of el events with the canonical eastern pacific and the modoki central pacific types being the two that receive the most attention 43 44 45 these different types of el events are classified by where the tropical pacific sea surface temperature sst anomalies are the largest 45 for example the strongest sea surface temperature anomalies associated with the canonical eastern pacific event are located off the coast of south america 45 the strongest anomalies associated with the modoki central pacific event are located near the international dateline 45 however during the duration of a single event the area with the greatest sea surface temperature anomalies can change 45 the traditional also called eastern pacific ep el 46 involves temperature anomalies in the eastern pacific however in the last two decades nontraditional el were observed in which the usual place of the temperature anomaly 1 and 2 is not affected but an anomaly arises in the central pacific 3.4 47 the phenomenon is called central pacific cp el 46 dateline el because the anomaly arises near the dateline or el modoki modoki is japanese for similar but different 48 49 50 51 the effects of the cp el are different from those of the traditional ep el the recently discovered el leads to more hurricanes more frequently making landfall in the atlantic 52 there is also a scientific debate on the very existence of this new enso indeed a number of studies dispute the reality of this statistical distinction or its increasing occurrence or both either arguing the reliable record is too short to detect such a distinction 53 54 finding no distinction or trend using other statistical approaches 55 56 57 58 59 or that other types should be distinguished such as standard and extreme enso 60 61 the first recorded el that originated in the central pacific and moved toward the east was in 1986 62 recent central pacific el happened in and 63 furthermore there were modoki events in 64 and 65 66 effects on the global climate edit el nino affects the global climate and disrupts normal weather patterns which as a result can lead to intense storms in some places and droughts in others 67 68 tropical cyclones edit most tropical cyclones form on the side of the subtropical ridge closer to the equator then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving into the main belt of the westerlies 69 areas west of japan and korea tend to experience much fewer tropical cyclone impacts during el and neutral years during el years the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near which would favor the japanese archipelago 70 within the atlantic ocean vertical wind shear is increased which inhibits tropical cyclone genesis and intensification by causing the westerly winds in the atmosphere to be stronger 71 the atmosphere over the atlantic ocean can also be drier and more stable during el events which can also inhibit tropical cyclone genesis and intensification 71 within the eastern pacific basin el events contribute to decreased easterly vertical wind shear and favours above normal hurricane activity 72 however the impacts of the enso state in this region can vary and are strongly influenced by background climate patterns 72 the western pacific basin experiences a change in the location of where tropical cyclones form during el events without a major change in how many develop each year 71 as a result of this change micronesia is more likely to be affected by several tropical cyclones while china has a decreased risk of being affected by several tropical cyclones citation needed a change in the location of where tropical cyclones form also occurs within the southern pacific ocean between and with tropical cyclones more likely to occur within the southern pacific basin than the australian region 10 71 as a result of this change tropical cyclones are 50% less likely to make landfall on queensland while the risk of a tropical cyclone is elevated for island nations like niue french polynesia tonga tuvalu and the cook islands 10 73 74 remote influence on tropical atlantic ocean edit a study of climate records has shown that el events in the equatorial pacific are generally associated with a warm tropical north atlantic in the following spring and summer 75 about half of el events persist sufficiently into the spring months for the western hemisphere warm pool to become unusually large in summer 76 occasionally el effect on the atlantic walker circulation over south america strengthens the easterly trade winds in the western equatorial atlantic region as a result an unusual cooling may occur in the eastern equatorial atlantic in spring and summer following el peaks in winter 77 cases of el events in both oceans simultaneously have been linked to severe famines related to the extended failure of monsoon rains 22 antarctica edit many enso linkages exist in the high southern latitudes around antarctica 78 specifically el conditions result in high pressure anomalies over the amundsen and bellingshausen seas causing reduced sea ice and increased poleward heat fluxes in these sectors as well as the ross sea the weddell sea conversely tends to become colder with more sea ice during el the exact opposite heating and atmospheric pressure anomalies occur during la 79 this pattern of variability is known as the antarctic dipole mode although the antarctic response to enso forcing is not ubiquitous 79 regional impacts edit observations of el events since 1950 show that impacts associated with el events depend on what season it is 80 however while certain events and impacts are expected to occur during events it is not certain or guaranteed that they will occur 80 the impacts that generally do occur during most el events include below average rainfall over indonesia and northern south america while above average rainfall occurs in southeastern south america eastern equatorial africa and the southern united states 80 australia and the southern pacific edit during el events the shift in rainfall away from the western pacific may mean that rainfall across australia is reduced 10 over the southern part of the continent warmer than average temperatures can be recorded as weather systems are more mobile and fewer blocking areas of high pressure occur 10 the onset of the indo australian monsoon in tropical australia is delayed by two to six weeks which as a consequence means that rainfall is reduced over the northern tropics 10 the risk of a significant bushfire season in south eastern australia is higher following an el event especially when it is combined with a positive indian ocean dipole event 10 during an el event new zealand tends to experience stronger or more frequent westerly winds during their summer which leads to an elevated risk of drier than normal conditions along the east coast 81 there is more rain than usual though on new west coast because of the barrier effect of the north island mountain ranges and the southern alps 81 fiji generally experiences drier than normal conditions during an el which can lead to drought becoming established over the islands 82 however the main impacts on the island nation is felt about a year after the event becomes established 82 within the samoan islands below average rainfall and higher than normal temperatures are recorded during el events which can lead to droughts and forest fires on the islands 83 other impacts include a decrease in the sea level possibility of coral bleaching in the marine environment and an increased risk of a tropical cyclone affecting samoa 83 africa edit in africa east africa including kenya tanzania and the white nile experiences in the long rains from march to may wetter than normal conditions conditions are also drier than normal from december to february in south central africa mainly in zambia zimbabwe mozambique and botswana asia edit as warm water spreads from the west pacific and the indian ocean to the east pacific it takes the rain with it causing extensive drought in the western pacific and rainfall in the normally dry eastern pacific singapore experienced the driest february in 2014 since records began in 1869 with only of rain falling in the month and temperatures hitting as high as on 26 february the years 1968 and 2005 had the next driest februaries when of rain fell 84 europe edit el effects on europe are controversial complex and difficult to analyse as it is one of several factors that influence the weather over the continent and other factors can overwhelm the signal 85 86 north america edit regional impacts of warm enso episodes el see also effects of the el oscillation in the united states over north america the main temperature and precipitation impacts of el generally occur in the six months between october and march 87 88 in particular the majority of canada generally has a milder than normal winters and cold fronts springs with the exception of eastern canada where no significant impacts occur 89 within the united states the impacts generally observed during the six month period include wetter than average conditions along the gulf coast between texas and florida while drier conditions are observed in hawaii the ohio valley pacific northwest and the rocky mountains 87 over california and the south western united states there is a weak relationship between el nino and above average precipitation as it strongly depends on the strength of the el event amongst other factors 87 the synoptic condition for the tehuantepecer is associated with high pressure system forming in sierra madre of mexico in the wake of an advancing cold front which causes winds to accelerate through the isthmus of tehuantepec tehuantepecers primarily occur during the cold season months for the region in the wake of cold fronts between october and february with a summer maximum in july caused by the westward extension of the azores high wind magnitude is greater during el years than during la years due to the more frequent cold frontal incursions during el winters 90 its effects can last from a few hours to six days 91 south america edit because el warm pool feeds thunderstorms above it creates increased rainfall across the east central and eastern pacific ocean including several portions of the south american west coast the effects of el in south america are direct and stronger than in north america an el is associated with warm and very wet weather months in along the coasts of northern peru and ecuador causing major flooding whenever the event is strong or extreme 92 the effects during the months of february march and april may become critical along the west coast of south america el reduces the upwelling of cold nutrient rich water that sustains large fish populations which in turn sustain abundant sea birds whose droppings support the fertilizer industry the reduction in upwelling leads to fish kills off the shore of peru 93 the local fishing industry along the affected coastline can suffer during long lasting el events the largest fishery collapsed due to overfishing during the 1972 el peruvian anchoveta reduction during the event jack mackerel and anchoveta populations were reduced scallops increased in warmer water but hake followed cooler water down the continental slope while shrimp and sardines moved southward so some catches decreased while others increased 94 horse mackerel have increased in the region during warm events shifting locations and types of fish due to changing conditions provide challenges for fishing industries peruvian sardines have moved during el events to chilean areas other conditions provide further complications such as the government of chile in 1991 creating restrictions on the fishing areas for self employed fishermen and industrial fleets citation needed the enso variability may contribute to the great success of small fast growing species along the peruvian coast as periods of low population removes predators in the area similar effects benefit migratory birds that travel each spring from predator rich tropical areas to distant winter stressed nesting areas citation needed southern brazil and northern argentina also experience wetter than normal conditions but mainly during the spring and early summer central chile receives a mild winter with large rainfall and the peruvian bolivian altiplano is sometimes exposed to unusual winter snowfall events drier and hotter weather occurs in parts of the amazon river basin colombia and central america citation needed effects on humanity edit economic effect edit el has the most direct impacts on life in the equatorial pacific its effects propagate north and south along the coast of the americas affecting marine life all around the pacific changes in chlorophyll a concentrations are visible in this animation which compares phytoplankton in january and july 1998 since then scientists have improved both the collection and presentation of chlorophyll data when el conditions last for many months extensive ocean warming and the reduction in easterly trade winds limits upwelling of cold nutrient rich deep water and its economic effect on local fishing for an international market can be serious 93 more generally el can affect commodity prices and the macroeconomy of different countries it can constrain the supply of rain driven agricultural commodities reduce agricultural output construction and services activities create food price and generalised inflation and may trigger social unrest in commodity dependent poor countries that primarily rely on imported food 95 a university of cambridge working paper shows that while australia chile indonesia india japan new zealand and south africa face a short lived fall in economic activity in response to an el shock other countries may actually benefit from an el weather shock either directly or indirectly through positive spillovers from major trading partners for instance argentina canada mexico and the united states furthermore most countries experience short run inflationary pressures following an el shock while global energy and non fuel commodity prices increase 96 the imf estimates a significant el can boost the gdp of the united states by about 0.5% due largely to lower heating bills and reduce the gdp of indonesia by about 1.0 97 health and social effects edit extreme weather conditions related to the el cycle correlate with changes in the incidence of epidemic diseases for example the el cycle is associated with increased risks of some of the diseases transmitted by mosquitoes such as malaria dengue and rift valley fever 98 cycles of malaria in india venezuela brazil and colombia have now been linked to el outbreaks of another mosquito transmitted disease australian encephalitis murray valley encephalitis occur in temperate south east australia after heavy rainfall and flooding which are associated with la events a severe outbreak of rift valley fever occurred after extreme rainfall in north eastern kenya and southern somalia during the el 99 enso conditions have also been related to kawasaki disease incidence in japan and the west coast of the united states 100 via the linkage to tropospheric winds across the north pacific ocean 101 enso may be linked to civil conflicts scientists at the earth institute of columbia university having analyzed data from 1950 to 2004 suggest enso may have had a role in 21% of all civil conflicts since 1950 with the risk of annual civil conflict doubling from 3% to 6% in countries affected by enso during el years relative to la years 102 103
