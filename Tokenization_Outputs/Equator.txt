equator wikipedia equator from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search for other uses see equator disambiguation equator nations or territories that touch the equator red or the iers reference meridian blue an equator is the intersection of the surface of a rotating spheroid such as a planet with the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation and midway between its poles on earth the equator is an imaginary line on the surface equidistant from the north and south poles dividing the earth into northern and southern hemispheres it is about 40,075 kilometres long of which 78.7% lies across water and 21.3% over land contents 1 overview 2 geodesy 2.1 precise location 2.2 exact length 3 crossing the equator ceremonies 4 equatorial countries and territories 5 equatorial seasons and climate 6 see also 7 references 8 sources overview edit left a monument marking the equator near the town of pontianak indonesia right road sign marking the equator near nanyuki kenya the latitude of the equator is by definition zero degrees of arc the equator is one of the five notable circles of latitude on earth the other four are the two polar circles the arctic circle and the antarctic circle and the two tropical circles the tropic of cancer and the tropic of capricorn the equator is the only line of latitude which is also a great circle that is one whose plane passes through the center of the globe the plane of equator when projected outwards to the celestial sphere defines the celestial equator in the cycle of seasons the plane of the equator passes through the sun twice per year at the march and september equinoxes to an observer on the earth the sun appears to travel north or south over the equator or the celestial equator at these times light rays from the center of the sun are perpendicular to the surface of the earth at the point of solar noon on the equator the equator marked as it crosses das rolas in and the marco zero monument marking the equator in brazil locations on the equator experience the quickest sunrises and sunsets because the sun moves nearly perpendicular to the horizon for most of the year the length of daylight sunrise to sunset is almost constant throughout the year it is about fourteen minutes longer than nighttime due to atmospheric refraction and the fact that sunrise is begun or sunset is ended as the upper edge not the centre of the disk crosses the horizon the earth bulges slightly at the equator the average diameter of the earth is 12,750 kilometres but the diameter at the equator is about 43 kilometres greater than at the poles 1 sites near the equator such as the guiana space centre in kourou french guiana are good locations for spaceports as they have a faster rotational speed than other latitudes the added velocity reduces the fuel needed to launch spacecraft because the earth spins to the east spacecraft must also launch to the east or to the southeast or northeast to take advantage of this earth boost of speed citation needed geodesy edit further information earth ellipsoid and reference ellipsoid precise location edit the precise location of the equator is not truly fixed the true equatorial plane is perpendicular to the spin axis which drifts about 9 metres during a year this effect must be accounted for in detailed geophysical measurements citation needed exact length edit in two widely used geodetic standards the equator is modelled as a circle whose radius is a whole number of metres in 1976 the iau chose a radius of 6,378.140 kilometres codified as the iau 1976 value later refined by the iugg to 6,378.137 kilometres and adopted in wgs 84 despite this change the yet more recent iau 2000 retained the old iau 1976 value if it were really circular the length of the equator would be exactly 2 times the radius namely 40,075.036 kilometres however due to the effect of tidal force on the surface the actual circumference at the equator is about 40,075.16 kilometres the geographical mile is defined as one arc minute of the equator so it has different values depending on which radius is assumed for example by wsg 84 the distance is 1,855.3248 metres while by iau 2000 it is 1,855.3257 metres this is a difference of less than one millimeter over the total distance approximately 1.86 kilometres the earth is commonly modeled as a sphere flattened 0.336% along its axis this makes the equator 0.16% longer than a meridian a great circle passing through the two poles the iugg standard meridian is to the nearest millimetre 40,007.862917 kilometres one arc minute of which is 1,852.216 metres explaining the si standardization of the nautical mile as 1,852 metres more than 3 metres less than the geographical mile the sea level surface of the earth the geoid is irregular so the actual length of the equator is not so easy to determine aviation week and space technology on 9 october 1961 reported that measurements using the transit iv a satellite had shown the equatorial diameter from longitude west to east to be 1,000 feet greater than its diameter ninety degrees away citation needed crossing the equator ceremonies edit main article line crossing ceremony certain navies such as the royal navy russian navy and us navy have a tradition of holding ceremonies aboard ships to mark sailors first crossing of the equator these rites of initiation have in the past been notorious for their brutality citation needed milder line crossing ceremonies typically featuring king neptune are also held for passengers entertainment on some civilian ocean liners and cruise ships

at the december solstice regardless of the time of day i e the earth rotation on its axis the north pole will be dark and the south pole will be illuminated see also arctic winter in addition to the density of incident light the dissipation of light in the atmosphere is greater when it falls at a shallow angle seasons result from the yearly revolution of the earth around the sun and the tilt of the axis relative to the plane of revolution during the year the northern and southern hemispheres are inclined toward or away from the sun according to position in its orbit the hemisphere inclined toward the sun receives more sunlight and is in summer while the other hemisphere receives less sun and is in winter see solstice at the equinoxes the axis is not tilted toward the sun instead it is perpendicular to the sun meaning that the day is about 12 hours long as is the night across the whole of the earth the equator lies mostly on the three largest oceans the atlantic ocean the indian ocean and the pacific ocean near the equator there is little temperature fluctuation throughout the year though there may be dramatic differences in rainfall and humidity the terms summer autumn winter and spring do not generally apply lowlands around the equator generally have a tropical rainforest climate also known as an equatorial climate though cold currents cause some regions to have tropical monsoon climates with a dry season in the middle of the year and the somali current generated by the asian monsoon due to continental heating via the high tibetan plateau causes greater somalia to have an arid climate despite its equatorial location average annual temperatures in equatorial lowlands are around during the day and at night rainfall is away from cold current upwelling zones very high from 2,500 to 98 to per year average rainy days are around 200 per year and average annual sunshine hours around 2,000 despite high year round sea level temperatures some higher altitudes such as the andes and mount kilimanjaro sustain glaciers the highest point on the equator is at the elevation of 4,690 metres at 0.00000 -77.99194 highest point on the equator found on the southern slopes of cayambe summit 5,790 metres in ecuador this is slightly above the snow line and is the only place on the equator where snow lies on the ground at the equator the snow line is around 1,000 metres lower than on mount everest and as much as 2,000 metres lower than the highest snow line in the world near the tropic of capricorn on llullaillaco climate data for brazil in south america
