11 upon its release helios received generally mixed reviews from music critics kevin catchpole from popmatters gave the album six out of ten discs commenting that the disappointing thing is how slight moments of innovation appear for fleeting seconds only then disappear into the ether it suggests a band that is capable of so much more if only it wanted to try 11 andy argyrakis of ccm magazine rated the album three stars out of five remarking how the release contains plenty of uplifting and contemplative lyrics yet their signature piano pop surfaces on occasion there seems to be a gravitation toward gang styled choruses and massive electronic beats which sometimes succeed but periodically appear too derivative of top 40 10 james christopher monger from allmusic gave the album two and a half out of five stars indicating how that helios begins innocuously enough with hold my hand a straight up anthem generator spawned arm waver that pairs a safe circular entirely familiar chord progression with a melody that returns the favor a description that applies to most if not all of the ten songs that follow before unleashing the first single love die a digitized boot stomper that leans hard on the kings of leon black keys side of the fray spectrum flirtations with disco give it away and pure killers cloned electro pop hurricane follow but the fray never sound as comfortable as they do when dishing out relatively generic yet undeniably impassioned slabs of springsteen train goo goo dolls and coldplay inspired open highway treacle like our last days and wherever this goes 9
