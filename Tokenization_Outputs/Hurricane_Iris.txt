an eye of only in diameter iris reached peak winds of before making landfall in southern belize near monkey river town on the hurricane quickly dissipated over central america although its remnants contributed to the formation of tropical storm manuel in the eastern pacific ocean destruction was heaviest in belize and totaled 2001 usd nb 2 because iris was compact the damage was largely confined

central america 4 aftermath 5 see also 6 notes 7 references 8 external links meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the scale toward the end of september 2001 a poorly defined tropical wave moved westward across the tropical atlantic ocean through an area of hostile wind shear which was caused by a large upper level low within a trough to the northeast of the lesser antilles 3 a few days later the upper level low detached from the trough and moved southwestward over the caribbean sea allowing for an upper level ridge or high pressure area to form over the tropical wave the change provided a favorable environment for tropical development and an area of convection soon blossomed along the axis as the tropical wave approached the lesser antilles a mid level wind circulation formed within the deepest part of the convection and a low level circulation became gradually more pronounced on satellite imagery although its low level circulation was small and poorly defined the system increased in organization enough to be classified as tropical depression eleven at 12 00 utc on located about southeast of barbados 3 operationally however hurricane hunters did not confirm the formation until nine hours later 4 in its early stages the depression moved west northwestward between the islands of st vincent and st lucia under the influence of a strong ridge to its north compared to its appearance before forming the depression exhibited improved outflow and more distinct convection although its lower circulation remained very poorly organized 4 this was confirmed by a hurricane hunters flight into the system which failed to report a closed circulation despite the well organized appearance on satellite imagery 5 at on they reported a strengthening circulation with flight level winds of corresponding to a surface wind intensity of based on these data the depression was upgraded to tropical storm iris situated about south of the southern coast of puerto rico 6 in post season analysis the national hurricane center nhc estimated that iris had attained tropical storm status about nine hours earlier 3 hurricane iris in the western caribbean sea on october 8 despite the intensification and well organized satellite appearance the circulation failed to become better defined 3 in their first discussion on iris the nhc mentioned the potential for the system to degenerate into a tropical wave if it maintained its fast forward speed 4 one forecaster noted that the center was fragile and that the cyclone could dissipate quickly if it encountered stronger wind shear to its south 6 although its overall appearance did not change significantly the hurricane hunters reported a closed eye with a diameter and a stadium effect eyewall curvature on 7 later that day iris reached hurricane strength just southwest of the southern tip of the dominican republic 3 and the nhc remarked that land interaction with the greater antilles was the only factor impeding further development 8 after iris reached winds of early on its intensity remained steady for about 3 during that time the satellite appearance became slightly ragged as its outflow became restricted possibly due to an upper level low 9 by late on the area of winds associated with iris extended only from its wide eye 10 11 early on after turning west southwestward away from the greater antilles iris began strengthening again with warm waters and an absence of significant wind shear the nhc predicted peak winds of before the storm would hit belize 12 it rapidly intensified with the favorable conditions intensifying from to in a 12 hour period on making iris a category 4 hurricane on the saffir simpson scale in the same duration the minimum central pressure dropped 38 mbar 1.12 inhg 3 while intensifying the hurricane developed concentric eyewalls with an innermost eye having a diameter of 13 for comparison the smallest known eye diameter on record for an atlantic hurricane was about during hurricane wilma in 2005 14 with such a small eye a hurricane hunters flight could not deploy a dropsonde into the center of iris 13 and shortly after the flight the innermost eye collapsed as the core paralleled the honduras coastline just offshore this resulted in a temporary and slight weakening during an eyewall replacement cycle but within a few hours iris re intensified to attain peak winds of just off belize at on it made landfall at peak intensity in monkey river town in the southern portion of belize 3 initially hurricane iris was forecast to remain a tropical cyclone while crossing central america and to re intensify in the eastern pacific ocean had it done so it would have retained the name iris 13 instead the hurricane rapidly weakened after moving into the mountainous terrain of guatemala and within six hours of landfall the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm late on within sixteen hours of landfall the circulation dissipated over extreme southeastern mexico 3 as the remnants approached the pacific ocean a new area of convection developed south of the original circulation of iris it gradually organized while continuing westward developing into tropical storm manuel the new storm ultimately lasted until before succumbing to cooler waters and wind shear 15 preparations edit over a stretch of four days sixteen tropical cyclone watches and warnings were issued in association with iris affecting the dominican republic the cuban provinces of granma and santiago de cuba jamaica cayman islands the peninsula guatemala honduras and belize 3 the threat from iris prompted the jamaica national emergency operations center to be activated shelters were opened in the country but were ultimately unused 16 in belize a hurricane warning was issued about before iris moved ashore 3 a state of national emergency was declared on as hurricane iris neared landfall all emergency response committees were activated to quickly begin recovery efforts 17 a mandatory evacuation was issued for stann creek and toledo coastal villages and all offshore islands the main hospital in belize city was evacuated as a precaution and the city itself was placed under a voluntary evacuation order 18 overall evacuated their homes in belize 19 including many in belize city 20 these evacuations were later credited for limiting the death toll 21 hurricane keith had struck the nation a year prior preparing some citizens for what to expect 20 disaster response teams arrived the day after iris was

hurricane produced a storm surge of up to 3 with waves of over in height 21 causing street flooding and some damage to the offshore cayes 35 as it moved ashore iris damaged houses and schools in dozens of villages 36 in the storm destroyed more than 95% of the buildings 37 its small size confined the worst damage largely to toledo and stann creek districts which are the two southernmost and poorest districts of the country 21 38 the percentage of damaged houses was 72% in toledo district and about 50% in stann creek 39 leaving about homeless 40 in both districts the storm caused power outages and contaminated water supplies 37 in the worst affected areas poor mayan people living on farms lost much of what they owned 37 at placencia near the coast about 80% of the homes were destroyed and many of the remaining buildings had roof damage with downed power poles in the streets 21 about 90% of the houses in nearby seine bight were destroyed 41 and where iris made landfall

crops to a lesser degree 42 the storm also flooded fields and killed several livestock the shrimp industry lost 25% of its catch 42 partly due to contaminated waters 45 crop damage in belize was estimated at 43 mostly from banana losses 42 strong winds also damaged large swaths of forest with upwards of 40% of trees affected in some areas 42 this disrupted the habitats of several animals and it is likely that many of the howler monkeys near monkey river were killed 46 the strong waves eroded the beach although marine effects were much less than those of hurricane keith in the previous
