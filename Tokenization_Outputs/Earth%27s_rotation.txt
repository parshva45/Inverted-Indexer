rotation wikipedia rotation from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search for the duration of daylight and night see daylight an animation is showing the rotation of earth around its own axis long exposure photograph of the northern night sky over the nepal himalayas showing the paths of the stars as earth rotates rotation is the rotation of planet earth around its own axis earth rotates eastward in prograde motion as viewed from the north pole star polaris earth turns counter clockwise the north pole also known as the geographic north pole or terrestrial north pole is the point in the northern hemisphere where axis of rotation meets its surface this point is distinct from north magnetic pole the south pole is the other point where axis of rotation intersects its surface in antarctica earth rotates once in about 24 hours with respect to the sun and once every 23 hours 56 minutes and 4 seconds with respect to the stars see below rotation is slowing slightly with time thus a day was shorter in the past this is due to the tidal effects the moon has on rotation atomic clocks show that a modern day is longer by about 1.7 milliseconds than a century ago 1

links history edit among the ancient greeks several of the pythagorean school believed in the rotation of the earth rather than the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens perhaps the first was philolaus bce though his system was complicated including a counter earth rotating daily about a central fire 3 a more conventional picture was that supported by hicetas heraclides and ecphantus in the fourth century bce who assumed that the earth rotated but did not suggest that the earth revolved about the sun in the third century bce aristarchus of samos suggested the central place however aristotle in the fourth century bce criticized the ideas of philolaus as being based on theory rather than observation he established the idea of a sphere of fixed stars that rotated about the earth 4 this was accepted by most of those who came after in particular claudius ptolemy 2nd century ce who thought the earth would be devastated by gales if it rotated 5 in 499 ce the indian astronomer aryabhata wrote that the spherical earth rotates about its axis daily and that the apparent movement of the stars is a relative motion caused by the rotation of the earth he provided the following analogy just as a man in a boat going in one direction sees the stationary things on the bank as moving in the opposite direction in the same way to a man at lanka the stars appear to be going westward 6 7 in the 10th century some muslim astronomers accepted that the earth rotates around its axis 8 according to al biruni abu al sijzi d circa 1020 invented an astrolabe called based on the idea believed by some of his contemporaries that the motion we see is due to the movement and not to that of the sky 9 10 the prevalence of this view is further confirmed by a reference from the 13th century which states according to the geometers or engineers the earth is in constant circular motion and what appears to be the motion of the heavens is actually due to the motion of the earth and not the stars 9 treatises were written to discuss its possibility either as refutations or expressing doubts about arguments against it 11 at the maragha and samarkand observatories the rotation was discussed by tusi b 1201 and qushji b 1403 the arguments and evidence they used resemble those used by copernicus 12 in medieval europe thomas aquinas accepted view 13 and so reluctantly did john buridan 14 and nicole oresme 15 in the fourteenth century not until nicolaus copernicus in 1543 adopted a heliocentric world system did the contemporary understanding of rotation begin to be established copernicus pointed out that if the movement of the earth is violent then the movement of the stars must be very much more so he acknowledged the contribution of the pythagoreans and pointed to examples of relative motion for copernicus this was the first step in establishing the simpler pattern of planets circling a central sun 16 tycho brahe who produced accurate observations on which kepler based his laws used work as the basis of a system assuming a stationary earth in 1600 william gilbert strongly supported the rotation in his treatise on the magnetism 17 and thereby influenced many of his contemporaries 18 those like gilbert who did not openly support or reject the motion of the earth about the sun are often called semi copernicans 19 a century after copernicus riccioli disputed the model of a rotating earth due to the lack of then observable eastward deflections in falling bodies 20 such deflections would later be called the coriolis effect however the contributions of kepler galileo and newton gathered support for the theory of the rotation of the earth empirical tests edit the rotation implies that the equator bulges and the poles are flattened in his principia newton predicted this flattening would occur in the ratio of 1 230 and pointed to the 1673 pendulum measurements by richer as corroboration of the change in gravity 21 but initial measurements of meridian lengths by picard and cassini at the end of the 17th century suggested the opposite however measurements by maupertuis and the french geodesic mission in the 1730s established the flattening thus confirming both newton and the copernican position 22 in the rotating frame of reference a freely moving body follows an apparent path that deviates from the one it would follow in a fixed frame of reference because of the coriolis effect falling bodies veer slightly eastward from the vertical plumb line below their point of release and projectiles veer right in the northern hemisphere and left in the southern from the direction in which they are shot the coriolis effect is mainly observable at a meteorological scale where it is responsible for the differing rotation direction of cyclones in the northern and southern hemispheres hooke following a 1679 suggestion from newton tried unsuccessfully to verify the predicted eastward deviation of a body dropped from a height of 8.2 meters but definitive results were only obtained later in the late 18th and early 19th century by giovanni battista guglielmini in bologna johann friedrich benzenberg in hamburg and ferdinand reich in freiberg using taller towers and carefully released weights n 1 a ball dropped from a height of departed by from the vertical compared with a calculated value of the most celebrated test of rotation is the foucault pendulum first built by physicist foucault in 1851 which consisted of a lead filled brass sphere suspended 67 m from the top of the in paris because of the rotation under the swinging pendulum the plane of oscillation appears to rotate at a rate depending on latitude at the latitude of paris the predicted and observed shift was about 11 degrees clockwise per hour foucault pendulums now swing in museums around the world rotation period edit starry circles arc around the south celestial pole seen overhead at eso s la silla observatory 23 true solar day edit main article solar time rotation period relative to the sun solar noon to solar noon is its true solar day or apparent solar day it depends on the orbital motion and is thus affected by changes in the eccentricity and inclination of orbit both vary over thousands of years so the annual variation of the true solar day also varies generally it is longer than the mean solar day during two periods of the year and shorter during another two n 2 the true solar day tends to be longer near perihelion when the sun apparently moves along the ecliptic through a greater angle than usual taking about 10 seconds longer to do so conversely it is about 10 seconds shorter near aphelion it is about 20 seconds longer near a solstice when the projection of the apparent motion along the ecliptic onto the celestial equator causes the sun to move through a greater angle than usual conversely near an equinox the projection onto the equator is shorter by about 20 seconds currently the perihelion and solstice effects combine to lengthen the true solar day near 22 december by 30 mean solar seconds but the solstice effect is partially cancelled by the aphelion effect near 19 june when it is only 13 seconds longer the effects of the equinoxes shorten it near 26 march and 16 september by 18 seconds and 21 seconds respectively 24 25 26 mean solar day edit main article mean solar day the average of the true solar day during the course of an entire year is the mean solar day which contains 86,400 mean solar seconds currently each of these seconds is slightly longer than an si second because mean solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal friction the average length of the mean solar day since the introduction of the leap second in 1972 has been about 0 to 2 ms longer than 86,400 si seconds 27 28 29 random fluctuations due to core mantle coupling have an amplitude of about 5 ms 30 31 the mean solar second between 1750 and 1892 was chosen in 1895 by simon newcomb as the independent unit of time in his tables of the sun these tables were used to calculate the ephemerides between 1900 and 1983 so this second became known as the ephemeris second in 1967 the si second was made equal to the ephemeris second 32 the apparent solar time is a measure of the rotation and the difference between it and the mean solar time is known as the equation of time stellar and sidereal day edit on a prograde planet like the earth the stellar day is shorter than the solar day at time 1 the sun and a certain distant star are both overhead at time 2 the planet has rotated and the distant star is overhead again but the sun is not one stellar day it is not until a little later at time 3 that the sun is overhead again one solar day rotation period relative to the fixed stars called its stellar day by the international earth rotation and reference systems service iers is 86,164.098 903 691 seconds of mean solar time ut1 23 h 56 m 4.098 903 691 s 0.997 269 663 237 16 mean solar days 33 n 3 rotation period relative to the precessing or moving mean vernal equinox named sidereal day is 86,164.090 530 832 88 seconds of mean solar time ut1 23 h 56 m 4.090 530 832 88 s 0.997 269 566 329 08 mean solar days 33 thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4 ms 35 both the stellar day and the sidereal day are shorter than the mean solar day by about 3 minutes 56 seconds the mean solar day in si seconds is available from the iers for the periods 36 and 37 recently the average annual length of the mean solar day in excess of 86,400 si seconds has varied between 0.25 ms and 1 ms which must be added to both the stellar and sidereal days given in mean solar time above to obtain their lengths in si seconds see fluctuations in the length of day angular speed edit plot of latitude vs tangential speed the dashed line shows that the kennedy space center example the dot dash line denotes typical airliner cruise speed the angular speed of rotation in inertial space is 7.2921150 0.0000001 10 radians per si second mean solar second 33 multiplying by seconds mean solar day yields solar day indicating that earth rotates more than relative to the fixed stars in one solar day movement along its nearly circular orbit while it is rotating once around its axis requires that earth rotate slightly more than once relative to the fixed stars before the mean sun can pass overhead again even though it rotates only once relative to the mean sun n 4 multiplying the value in rad s by equatorial radius of 6,378,137 m wgs84 ellipsoid factors of radians needed by both cancel yields an equatorial speed of or 38 some sources state that equatorial speed is slightly less or 1,669.8 km h 39 this is obtained by dividing equatorial circumference by 24 hours however the use of only one circumference unwittingly implies only one rotation in inertial space so the corresponding time unit must be a sidereal hour this is confirmed by multiplying by the number of sidereal days in one mean solar day 1.002 737 909 350 795 33 which yields the equatorial speed in mean solar hours given above of 1,674.4 km h the tangential speed of rotation at a point on earth can be approximated by multiplying the speed at the equator by the cosine of the latitude 40 for example the kennedy space center is located at latitude n which yields a speed of cos changes in rotation edit main articles fluctuations in the length of day and axial tilt is about it oscillates between and on a 41 000 year cycle and is currently decreasing change in rotational axis edit the rotation axis moves with respect to the fixed stars inertial space the components of this motion are precession and nutation it also moves with respect to the crust this is called polar motion precession is a rotation of the rotation axis caused primarily by external torques from the gravity of the sun moon and other bodies the polar motion is primarily due to free core nutation and the chandler wobble change in rotational velocity edit tidal interactions edit over millions of years the rotation slowed significantly by tidal acceleration through gravitational interactions with the moon in this process angular momentum is slowly transferred to the moon at a rate proportional to r 6 where r is the orbital radius of the moon this process gradually increased the length of day to its current value and resulted in the moon being tidally locked with the earth this gradual rotational deceleration is empirically documented with estimates of day lengths obtained from observations of tidal rhythmites and stromatolites a compilation of these measurements 41 found the length of day to increase steadily from about 21 hours at 600myr ago 42 to the current 24 hour value by counting the microscopic lamina that form at higher tides tidal frequencies and thus day lengths can be estimated much like counting tree rings though these estimates can be increasingly unreliable at older ages 43 resonant stabilization edit the current rate of tidal deceleration is anomalously high implying the rotational velocity must have decreased more slowly in the past empirical data 41 tentatively shows a sharp increase in rotational deceleration about 600myr ago some models suggest that the earth maintained a constant day length of 21 hours throughout much of the precambrian 42 this day length corresponds to the semidiurnal resonant period of the thermally driven atmospheric tide at this day length the decelerative lunar torque could have been canceled by an accelerative torque from the atmospheric tide resulting in no net torque and a constant rotational period this stabilizing effect could have been broken by a sudden change in global temperature recent computational simulations support this hypothesis and suggest the marinoan or sturtian glaciations broke this stable configuration about 600myr ago citing the resemblance of simulated results and existing paleorotational data 44 deviation of day length from si based day global events edit additionally some large scale events such as the 2004 indian ocean earthquake have caused the rotation to speed up by around 3 microseconds by affecting the moment of inertia 45 post glacial rebound ongoing since the last ice age is also changing the distribution of the mass thus affecting the moment of inertia of the earth and by the conservation of angular momentum the rotation period 46 measurement edit the permanent monitoring of the rotation is performed with very long baseline interferometry coordinated with the global positioning system satellite laser ranging and other satellite techniques this provides an absolute reference for the determination of universal time precession and nutation 47 ancient observations edit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be

beginning from the 8th century bce these observations as well as further astronomical historical records from astronomy in the medieval islamic world and elsewhere can be used to determine the actual changes in the rotation of the earth over the last 27 centuries the calculation to describe the place and time of eclipse is dependent on the rotation of the earth the ancient observations are consistent with the earth having rotated a significant fraction of a total turn than would result from value of the speed of rotation would indicate the earth was turning ever faster throughout the past the cumulative effect of the faster turn of a magnitude of milliseconds per day per century 36,525 days per century shows up in a magnitude of hours and thousands of kilometers in observations scholars have combed the ancient records and calculated by modern models the magnitude of the long term historical slowing down of the rotation 48 49 origin edit an rendering of the protoplanetary disk the original rotation was a vestige of the original angular momentum of the cloud of dust rocks and gas that coalesced to form the solar system this primordial cloud was composed of hydrogen and helium produced in the big bang as well as heavier elements ejected by supernovas as this interstellar dust is heterogeneous any asymmetry during gravitational accretion resulted in the angular momentum of the eventual planet 50 however if the giant impact hypothesis for the origin of the moon is correct this primordial rotation rate would have been reset by the theia impact 4.5 billion years ago regardless of the speed and tilt of the rotation before the impact it would have experienced a day some five hours long after the impact 51 tidal effects would then have slowed this rate to its modern value see also edit allais effect axial precession diurnal cycle orbit formation and evolution of the solar system geodesic in mathematics geodesics in general relativity geodesy giant
