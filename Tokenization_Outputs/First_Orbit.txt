yuri gagarin sergei korolev music by philip sheppard cinematography paolo nespoli edited by stephen slater tabitha moore distributed by youtube the attic room release date 2011-04-12 running time 105 minutes country united kingdom language english russian first orbit is a feature length experimental documentary film about vostok 1 the first manned space flight around the earth by matching the orbit of the international space station to that of vostok 1 as closely as possible in terms of ground track and time of day documentary filmmaker christopher riley and european space agency astronaut paolo nespoli were able to film the view that yuri gagarin saw on his pioneering orbital space flight this new footage was cut together with the original vostok 1 mission audio recordings sourced from the russian state archive of scientific and technical documentation the film features the music of composer philip sheppard contents 1 production 1.1 music 1.2 archive audio 2 global distribution 3

came up with the idea to film original view of the earth from space through the international space new giant windowed cupola the international space station iss orbits the earth once every 90 minutes but it does not always follow the same route that gagarin took to find out when filming opportunities might occur the european space agency esa teamed riley up with german orbital mechanical engineer gerald ziegler ziegler discovered that the iss covered similar ground to vostok 1 spaceship approximately every week to complicate things further the filmmakers needed to film at exactly the same time of day that gagarin made his flight passing over launch site near the aral sea at 06 07 ut and into the nightside of earth over the pacific ocean at 06 37 before emerging into sunlight again over the southern atlantic at 07 10 ut and passing across the african continent and the middle east returning to the ground at 07 55 ut just north of the caspian sea further calculations confirmed that opportunities to film this trajectory with the correct sun angles at this exact time of day only came around once every six weeks according to riley the second challenge was fitting these filming opportunities into crew time on board the space station the astronauts have a busy schedule conducting a packed programme of experiments earth observations and activities like sleep exercise and meal times this meant that accommodating the extra filming request for first orbit was yet another challenge for the esa mission directors he told bbc news in a march 2011 interview 1 on the final flight path back towards landing site the scenes shot for first orbit are slightly to the east of the original vostok 1 trajectory because the vantage point is so high the vista was similar to that of vantage point mission directors roland luettgens and giovanni gravili worked closely with the team to turn the filming opportunities into precise technical notes which translated camera directions into instructions for the crew after a brief test shoot in november 2010 conducted by expedition 25 astronaut doug wheelock european space agency astronaut paolo nespoli filmed most of the footage for the project in early january 2011 this new footage showed the earth as gagarin would have seen it almost exactly fifty years before the film does include views of the moon though when gagarin flew into the nightside of the earth on 12 april 1961 there was a crescent moon and according to his autobiography road to the stars gagarin tried looking for the moon out of curiosity to see what it looked like from space unfortunately it was not in his field of view the filmmakers added the moon into the scene as a tribute 2 music edit the music in first orbit was composed by philip sheppard and was taken from his album cloud songs riley first worked with sheppard in 2006 on the sundance award winning feature documentary film in the shadow of the moon since that time he had worked on a new suite of music inspired by space flight which he donated to this new film project coincidentally the music in the film was taken on board the iss by nasa astronaut catherine coleman before it was used in the film catherine coleman flew to the iss with astronaut and first orbit cameraman paolo nespoli without either of them knowing about the connection to the film project 3 archive audio edit the producers sourced portions of original mission audio for first orbit from the russian state archive these historic recordings principally document the conversation between yuri gagarin on board vostok 1 and sergei korolev on the ground according to riley it is the first time that such quantities of the flight have been heard outside russia 1 additional archive audio in the film comes from a radio moscow report broadcast during the flight and news bulletins from the bbc and the information telegraph agency of russia tass the russian recordings in the film are subtitled in english global
