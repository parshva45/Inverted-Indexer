the capital praia the principal urban agglomeration in the archipelago 27 three of the cape verde islands sal boa vista and maio are fairly flat sandy and dry the others are generally rockier with

rocks with volcanic structures and pyroclastic debris comprising the majority of the total volume the volcanic and plutonic rocks are distinctly basic the archipelago is a soda alkaline petrographic province with a petrologic succession similar to that found in other macaronesian islands magnetic anomalies identified in the vicinity of the archipelago indicate that the structures forming the islands date back million years the islands themselves date from 8 million in the west to 20 million years in the east 28 the oldest exposed rocks occurred on maio and northern peninsula of santiago and are million year old pillow lavas the first stage of volcanism in the islands began in the early miocene and reached its peak at the end of this period when the islands reached their maximum sizes historical volcanism within human settlement has been restricted to the island of fogo the origin of the islands volcanism has been attributed to a hotspot associated with bathymetric swell that formed the cape verde rise 29 the rise is one of the largest protuberances in the oceans rising 2.2 kilometres 1.4 miles in a semi circular region of 2 associated with a rise of the geoid and elevated surface heat flow 28 most recently erupting in 2014 pico do fogo is the largest active volcano in the region it has a 8 kilometres 5 miles diameter caldera whose rim is 1,600 metres 5,249 feet altitude and an interior cone that rises to 2,829 metres 9,281 feet above sea level the caldera resulted from subsidence following the partial evacuation eruption of the magma chamber along a

relief of some islands such as santiago with steep mountains cover it with rich woods and luxuriant vegetation where the humid air condenses and soak the plants rocks soil logs moss etc on the higher
