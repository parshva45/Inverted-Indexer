pressurized mating adapter wikipedia pressurized mating adapter from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search space shuttle discovery docked to one of the iss pmas the pressurized mating adapter pma is a spacecraft adapter that converts the common berthing mechanism cbm used on the us orbital segment to apas 95 docking ports there are three pmas located on the international space station iss the first two pmas were launched with the unity module in 1998 aboard sts 88 the third was launched in 2000 aboard sts 92 contents 1 uses 1.1 pma 1 1.2 pma 2 1.3 pma 3 2 construction 3 images 4 see also 5 references uses edit unity already docked to endeavour via pma 2 docking with zarya via pma 1 nasa all the pmas on the iss are identical 1 but used slightly differently and all three perform the same basic function of connecting a common berthing mechanism port of an iss module to an apas 95 docking port of another module or visiting spacecraft 2 for this the pmas carry a passive cbm port and a passive apas port they are pressurized and heated from the inside and through docking rings as well as external connections allow for power and data communications transfer 3 pma 1 edit this was one of the first components of the international space station and joins the russian side of the station with the us side on sts 88 the crew used the robotic arm to attach the zarya control module to pma 1 which was already connected to the aft berthing port of unity pma 1 now permanently connects these first two station components pma 2 edit pma 2 is currently mounted on the forward port of the harmony connecting node and was used when space shuttle orbiters docked at the station it is the only pma that has been outfitted with station to shuttle power transfer system sspts hardware which allowed shuttles to stay docked longer to the space station 4 due to space station assembly pma 2 has been moved several times it was originally connected to the forward hatch of unity but when sts 98 delivered the destiny in february 2001 destiny was berthed to that hatch while pma 2 was moved to the forward hatch of the z1 truss it was finally moved to the forward hatch of destiny 5 the removal of pma 2 from unity was the first time the common berthing mechanism cbm was used to disconnect two iss components 6 after sts 120 had delivered harmony at the station in october 2007 canadarm2 relocated pma 2 to its final location at the forward hatch of harmony on november 12 2007 two days later the combined package of harmony and pma 2 was moved to its final location the forward hatch of destiny pma 2 will stay berthed at the forward port of harmony for the remaining duration of the iss when a shuttle docked with the station its final approach was at a relative velocity of one tenth of a foot per second as it made contact with pressurized mating adapter 2 latches automatically attached the two spacecraft together once relative motion between the spacecraft stopped a shuttle astronaut retracted the docking ring on the mechanism closing latches to firmly secure the shuttle to the station 7 planned locations of the international docking adapters international docking adapter -2 was launched on spacex crs 9 on 18 july 2016 8 it was attached and connected to pma 2 during a spacewalk on 19 august 2016 ref 9 pma 3 edit in october 2000 sts 92 brought pma 3 mounted on a spacelab pallet to the station 10 it was initially attached to the nadir bottom or earth facing hatch of unity one and a half months later when sts 97 delivered the p6 solar array truss structure endeavour docked at pma 3 11 also when sts 98 moved pma 2 from unity to destiny via z1 atlantis was docked at pma 3 5 pma 3 was not used for shuttle dockings for the rest of the operation pma 3 was moved in march 2001 to unity s port hatch by the crew of sts 102 to make room for the docking of a multi purpose logistics module mplm 12 on august 30 2007 pma 3 was moved to the nadir port of unity to make room for the temporary docking of the new harmony module that was delivered by sts 120 13 harmony was transferred to the forward port of destiny while pma 3 was moved back to the port berthing mechanism of unity on august 7 2009 to accommodate reconfiguration of the unity port bulkhead by crew members in a pressurized environment 14 on january 25 2010 pma 3 was moved from the port berthing mechanism of unity to the zenith space facing port of harmony to make room for the new tranquility node 3 module which was added to the station during sts 130 after activation of tranquility pma 3 was moved again on february 16 2010 to the port location on tranquility where the cupola had been docked for launch 15 the pressurized mating adapter 3 pma 3 was robotically removed march 26 2017 from the tranquility module and attached to the harmony module after being prepared during a successful spacewalk on march 24 2017 a second spacewalk was conducted on march 30 2017 to finalize the pma 3 cable connections on harmony pma 3 will receive the international docking adapter -3 adapter in may 2018 16 construction edit the three pressurized mating adapters were
