was a space shuttle mission to the international space station iss flown by space shuttle atlantis it was the first assembly mission to the iss after the columbia disaster following the two successful return to flight missions sts 114 and sts 121 sts 115 launched from pad 39 b at the kennedy space center on 9 september 2006 at 11 14 55 edt 15 14 55 utc the mission is also referred to as iss 12a by the iss program the mission delivered the second port side truss segment its p3 p4 a pair of solar arrays 2a and 4a and batteries a total of three spacewalks were performed during which the crew connected the systems on the installed trusses prepared them for deployment and did other maintenance work on the station sts 115 was originally scheduled to launch in april 2003 the columbia accident in february 2003 pushed the date back to 27 august 2006 which was again moved back for various reasons including a threat from tropical storm ernesto and the strongest lightning strike to ever hit an

to move the sts 115 launch date forward to 27 august to obtain better lighting conditions to photograph the external tank this occurred before with sts 31 and sts 82 4 the launch window was co ordinated with the soyuz tma 9 launch in mid september which delivered a new iss crew and fresh supplies to the station the soyuz spacecraft operationally did not dock to the station while the space shuttle was there 5 the mission marks 1 147th nasa manned space flight 116th space shuttle flight since sts 1 27th flight of atlantis 91st post challenger mission 3rd post columbia mission 1st post columbia mission of atlantis mission timeline edit launch preparations edit atlantis is rolled over from the opf atlantis shown in the vab ready to be mated to the external tank atlantis was rolled out from the orbiter processing facility to the vehicle assembly building vab on 24 july 2006 it was lowered onto the mobile launcher platform on 26 july and rolled out to pad 39b in the early morning hours of 2 august the rollout was scheduled for 31 july but a storm in the vicinity of the kennedy space center resulted in a delay of two days from fears of the orbiter being hit by lightning which could cause immeasurable damage on the weekend of 5 to 6 august 2006 engineers completed a flight readiness check of the main engines which were deemed ready for launch the crew arrived at the kennedy space center 7 august 2006 for four days of launch rehearsals including a practice countdown 10 august 6 top nasa managers held a flight readiness review frr meeting august 2006 to finalize the launch date 7 foam loss from the external tank was a key issue at this meeting because on 13 august 2006 nasa announced there was an average amount of loss from the external tank of sts 121 the previous mission 8 columbia s demise was due to a piece of foam shed from its external tank striking the left wing during launch and causing a hole that was breached during re entry atlantis on launch pad 39b on 2006-08-02 the meeting also discussed problems with the bolts securing the k u band antenna which might not have been threaded correctly the installation had been in place for several flights and experienced any problems 9 at the end of the two day meeting nasa managers had decided to proceed with the launch on 27 august 2006 however on 18 august 2006 nasa decided to replace the antenna bolts with atlantis still on the launch pad nasa had no procedure to replace these on the pad but the work was nonetheless completed by 20 august without affecting the planned launch date 10 image of lightning strike on 25 august 2006 a direct lightning strike the most powerful recorded at kennedy space center hit the lightning rod atop the launch pad 11 as a result on 26 august the mission management team ordered the mission postponed for at least 24 hours to assess damage 12 on 27 august the decision was made to postpone the launch for another 24 hours making the earliest possible launch date 29 august 2006 still unassured that there was no damage from the lightning strike and taking into account the possible threat from hurricane ernesto atlantis heads back to launch pad 39b to ride out ernesto on 28 august 2006 it was decided to postpone the launch and rollback atlantis to the vab after updated forecasts projected hurricane ernesto would regain its strength and pass closer to kennedy space center than previously anticipated 13 nasa began rolling back the shuttle on 29 august 2006 in the late morning but by early afternoon the decision was made to move atlantis back to the launch pad something that has never been done before to weather out tropical storm ernesto instead the change came after weather forecasters determined that the storm hit kennedy space center as forcefully as they once thought its peak winds were expected to be less than 126 kilometers per hour limit for keeping the shuttle outdoors 14 15 16 by the early morning of 31 august 2006 the storm had passed and inspection teams began a survey for damage to the launch facilities only three problems were discovered all of which were simple repairs a target date for launch was set for 6 september with the option to launch for another two days after nasa and russian space managers agreed to extend the launch window by one day 17 18 on the morning of 3 september 2006 the official countdown began at the t minus 43 hour mark with about 30 hours of scheduled holds in the early morning of 6 september 2006 engineers observed an apparent internal short when one of the three electricity producing fuel cells was powered up when engineers figure out the problem in time the launch was scrubbed for the day to further analyze the fuel cell problem 19 late wednesday evening nasa managers decided that they would not attempt a launch on thursday and scheduled the next launch attempt for 8 september 2006 originally they had ruled out 9 september as a potential launch date due to a conflict with the planned russian soyuz mission soyuz tma 9 which was scheduled to and did launch on 18 september 2006 this caused some news agencies to report that friday as the last chance for a launch until october 20 8 september launch attempt 1 edit on the morning of 8 september 2006 it was reported that one of the engine cut off eco sensors in the external tank had failed 21 about half an hour before the scheduled launch time nasa announced it had decided to delay the launch for another 24 hours while the fuel was drained out of the external tank and the problem assessed 22 the sensor in question eco sensor no 3 was proved to be faulty when it indicated that there was still liquid hydrogen in the external tank despite all of it being drained out the other three eco sensors correctly indicated a dry tank and as long as they start to malfunction nasa could allow a launch with three out of the four eco sensors operational 23 attempt planned result turnaround reason

working properly and following a flawless countdown at 15 15 utc 11 15 edt atlantis lifted off the launch pad to the international space station 24 25 as atlantis launched the international space station was 350 kilometres above the northern atlantic ocean between greenland and iceland 25 during the climb to orbit mission control asked the crew to reconfigure a cooling system that apparently had ice build up the reconfiguration cleared the system called the flash evaporator system and it operated normally temporary ice in that cooling unit is not uncommon and has occurred on previous missions 25 moments after main engine cutoff 8.5 minutes after liftoff tanner and maclean used hand held video and digital still cameras to document the external tank after it separated from the shuttle that imagery as well as imagery gathered by cameras in the umbilical well where the tank was connected was transmitted to the ground for review 25 10 september flight day 2 edit day 2 canadarm inspection animation atlantis approaching the iss with the p3 p4 truss segment and solar arrays in the payload bay during their first full day in space the crew thoroughly examined atlantis with the orbiter boom sensor system the 15 meter 50 foot long extension for the robotic arm pilot chris ferguson and mission specialists dan burbank and steve maclean performed a slow steady inspection of the reinforced carbon carbon panels along the leading edge of atlantis starboard and port wings and the nose cap 26 the crew worked ahead of schedule for most of the day readying the ship for docking and preparing for the three planned extra vehicular activities eva mission specialists joe tanner and heide stefanyshyn piper checked out the spacesuits and tools that they burbank and maclean used during spacewalks set for days 4 5 and 7 the spacewalks installed the girder like p3 p4 truss deploy new solar arrays and prepare them for operation 26 on the space station expedition 13 flight engineer jeffrey williams prepared the orbiting laboratory for atlantis arrival on day 3 he readied the digital cameras that was used to take high resolution photos of the heat shield with help from commander pavel vinogradov williams pressurized the pressurized mating adapter 2 at the end of the destiny laboratory module where atlantis later docked vinogradov also prepacked equipment to be returned 26 11

stationed about 180 meters below the space station the maneuver allowed the expedition 13 crew to take a series of high resolution photographs of the heat shield 27 at about 10 46 utc atlantis docked with the international space station and almost two hours later the hatch between them was opened and the crew was welcomed aboard the station at 12 35 utc 27 day 3 handoff animation following docking ferguson and burbank attached the robotic canadarm to the 17 5 ton p3 p4 truss lifted it from its berth in the payload bay and maneuvered it for handover to the canadarm2 27 after hatch opening maclean and expedition 13 flight engineer jeff williams then used the canadarm2 to take the truss from the robotic arm maclean is the first canadian to operate the canadarm2 in space 27 tanner and stefanyshyn piper began the camping out preparations in the quest airlock to prepare for a day 4 spacewalk the preparations are new pre breathing measures on the part of nasa to avoid decompression sickness or the bends by getting rid of some nitrogen in their bloodstreams the preparations involve wearing oxygen masks and sleeping overnight in the airlock with the airlock at under 69 kpa 10 psi to acclimate their bodies the low pressures they will encounter when wearing their spacesuits 27 12 september flight day 4 edit day 4 truss installation animation joseph tanner installing the p3 p4 truss on day extra vehicular activity following the installation of the p3 p4 truss to the iss by the canadarm2 tanner and stefanyshyn piper began their spacewalk to activate the truss at 09 17 utc during the eva they installed power and data cables between the p1 p3 p4 trusses released the p3 p4 truss launch restraints and a number of other tasks to configure the truss for upcoming activities the spacewalk was so successful that the astronauts carried out a number of tasks scheduled for later evas with the eventual completion of the eva at 15 43 utc a bolt spring and washer assembly from a launch lock was lost during these extra activities and floated off into space 28 following the completion of the eva the crew began preparing for day spacewalk with astronauts burbank and maclean entering the quest airlock for their camp out at 18 40 utc ready for the scheduled 09 15 utc eva 13 september flight day 5 edit day 5 activation of sarj animation the new p3 p4 truss during eva 2 also the new undeployed solar arrays can be seen on the bottom right on day 5 the second spacewalk of the mission was conducted this time by first time spacewalkers burbank and maclean they devoted the day to the final tasks required for activation of the solar alpha rotary joint sarj the sarj is an automobile sized joint that will allow the solar arrays to turn and point toward the sun burbank and maclean released locks that had held the joint secure during its launch to orbit aboard atlantis as they worked the spacewalkers overcame several minor problems including a malfunctioning helmet camera a broken socket tool a stubborn bolt and a bolt that came loose from the mechanism designed to hold it captive the stubborn bolt required the force of both spacewalkers to finally remove it 29 30 burbank and maclean spent 7 hours and 11 minutes outside the station beginning their spacewalk at 09 05 utc and completing it at 16 16 utc in addition to the sarj work they completed several get ahead tasks during their time outside 29 engineers encountered a glitch during the four hour activation and checkout of sarj and had temporarily delayed starting the deployment of the new solar arrays pending further work and checkout of the sarj the timeline allowed ample time to continue working on the problem during the night and still complete the deploy of the arrays on thursday as scheduled 29 31 14 september flight day 6 edit day 6 solar array deployment animation a solar array on the p4 truss fully deployed on day 6 day 6 continued the installation of the solar array the unfurling of the solar panels themselves began a little behind schedule due to the problem encountered on day 5 with sarj this problem was determined to be in the software and a workaround was developed the unfurling of the panels continued throughout the morning in stages to prevent the panels sticking as they did during sts 97 32 it was noted by the crew that some panels were still sticking together but this cause any problems 33 although the installation has been completed the solar arrays will not provide power to the station until the next shuttle mission sts 116 scheduled for december 2006 when the station will undergo a major electrical system rewiring 34 other activities of day 6 included a double walk off of the canadarm2 from its current location at the mobile base system to the destiny laboratory module 33 and the preparation for the third spacewalk a number of interviews were also conducted later in the day between jett maclean and canadian prime minister stephen harper students 15 september flight day 7 edit a radiator on the p4 truss after unfolding on day 7 flight day 7 featured the third and final spacewalk of mission sts 115 the start of the spacewalk was delayed after a circuit breaker like remote power controller rpc tripped causing loss of power to the depressurization pump this was attributed to a momentary spike in the electric current of the depressurization pump after assessing data to ensure the system had no short circuit the breaker was reset and pump reactivated 35 joe tanner and heide stefanyshyn piper began their spacewalk at 10 00 utc after a 45 minute delay 36 during the 6 hour and 42 minute spacewalk the astronauts carried out numerous maintenance and repair tasks including removal of hardware used to secure the p3 p4 radiator during launch ground flight controllers subsequently unfurled the radiator increasing the ability of the station to dissipate heat into space also completed during this spacewalk was the retrieval of a materials exposure experiment from the outside of the iss maintenance on the p6 truss installation of a wireless tv aerial and the replacement of the s1 truss s band antenna assembly a number of get ahead tasks previously scheduled for future missions were also performed during this spacewalk near the end of the spacewalk the astronauts carried out a test to evaluate using infrared video of the leading edge of atlantis wing to detect debris damage 36 after the spacewalk the mobile transporter was moved to a worksite on the p3 truss to inspect portions of that truss 16 september flight day 8 edit day 8 of sts 115 the last full day with space shuttle atlantis docked to the iss was mainly spent in preparation for the undocking procedures to occur in flight day 9 the crew spent the morning resting following their highly successful mission and then began getting ready for the undocking by carrying out transfers of iss equipment and science experiments onto atlantis ready for the trip home 37 the crews of expedition 13 and sts 115 also took part in the traditional joint crew news conference with mission commander brent jett commenting on the success of the mission and on the construction missions to follow all of the rest of the assembly missions are going to be challenging we have similar payloads flying in the future we are off to a good start on assembly i think we can pass along a lot of the lessons to the future crews 17 september flight day 9 edit new configuration of the iss taken on day 9 after undocking flight day 9 saw the end of tasks at the iss as atlantis undocked from the international space station at 12 50 utc following the traditional farewell ceremonies between expedition 13 and sts 115 the hatch between atlantis and the iss was closed and locked at 10 27 utc then after a series of checks for leaks atlantis left the dock to begin its 360 degree flyaround of the expanded iss to document the new configuration 18 september flight day 10 edit the crew of sts 115 spent the morning of flight day 10 carrying out final inspections of atlantis heat shield in preparation for re entry on flight day 12 orbiting around 80 kilometers behind the iss the crew used the robotic arm and boom sensor system to make sure that no damage had been done to atlantis nose wing leading edges by micrometeoroids and other space junk the crew spent the rest of this light duty day stowing equipment in preparation for re entry and landing 19 september flight day 11 edit image of the unknown flying object in its co orbital path with atlantis high resolution image of a second unknown flying object during the morning of day 11 astronauts jett ferguson tested atlantis reaction control thrusters and practiced for landing using on board computers the thrusters will be used to position the shuttle during re entry the crew also took some time for interviews with ferguson telling the media that everyone on board was looking forward to landing i think we all thus far feel pretty good about the job that we did ferguson said we are looking forward to a successful re entry and landing sometime tomorrow following the interviews the crew continued their preparations for re entry by stowing unnecessary equipment and other tasks prior to landing however the crew informed the mission control center later in the day that following the test of the reaction control system an object was seen moving in a co orbital path with the orbiter the astronauts spotted the object using an on board tv camera but unfortunately the resolution of the images was not high enough to identify the object the images were sent down to the mcc for further analysis by flight controllers who were concerned about the possibility that the object may have come off atlantis and as such wished to identify the object the most likely scenario was that the object was benign such as ice or a piece of shimstock observed earlier in the flight protruding from the heat shield that may have shaken loose 38 however the possibility remained that the object may be of critical importance such as a tile from the thermal protection system as such the mission control center asked atlantis crew to power up the robotic arm ready to reinspect the orbiter and drew up plans for a series of tests which took place on flight day 12 to determine whether the shuttle was safe for re entry this extra inspection added to poor weather forecasts predicted for the shuttle landing facility for wednesday meant that the de orbit burn and landing were delayed by a day 20 september flight day 12 edit following the discovery of a co orbiting object on flight day 11 flight controllers spent the early hours of the morning using the robotic arm to inspect the upper surface of atlantis with the astronauts on board the orbiter spending the rest of the morning scanning the underside of the shuttle for any areas of concern following these scans the crew received word from the mission control center in houston to use the orbiter boom sensor system to conduct more inspections of atlantis heat shield following the review of these scans together with an overnight analysis of the payload bay by ground flight controllers it was determined that there remained no safety issue with atlantis and mission controllers cleared the orbiter for re entry this clean bill of health added to a favorable weather forecast for the shuttle landing facility for thursday morning permitted atlantis to be cleared for a landing the next day the crew spent the remainder of the day in preparation for landing packing up gear and stowing the ku band antenna used for tv broadcasts during the inspection the crew was notified that the soyuz tma 9 spacecraft was docked with the iss above which carried the first half of the expedition 14 crew 21 september flight day 13 and landing edit concluding mission sts 115 atlantis and her crew return to kennedy space center and approach a landing before sunrise on runway 33 the drag chute glows in the lights illuminating atlantis as it touches down on runway 33 damage caused by micrometeoroid impact nasa flight day 13 was the last day of the mission with the final re entry procedures and landing taking place during the morning and numerous debriefs and conferences in the afternoon the landing process began hours before the actual landing at kennedy space center the process began with the apu prestart at 04 37 edt followed by the closing of the payload bay doors and sealing of the orbiter at 04 45 edt atlantis crew received the final go for the prime re entry window from mission control in houston at 04 52 edt the crew then started the deorbit reorientation of the shuttle so that its engines faced in its direction of travel meaning that by firing the engines for the deorbit burn atlantis would slow down and begin its descent out of orbit the de orbit burn was initiated at 05 15 edt lasting 2 minutes 40 seconds with two engines burning well throughout the astronauts aboard the orbiter were informed at 05 17 edt that their burn was perfect with no alterations required as atlantis began her drop through the atmosphere above the indian ocean following the deorbit burn the crew of atlantis began dumping excess propellant overboard a process lasting 3 minutes concluding at 05 26 edt with the orbiter 55 minutes away from landing twenty five minutes later at 05 51 edt atlantis began feeling the effects of the atmosphere at an altitude of approximately 130 kilometres and soon after began its roll reversal banking in order to bleed off most of the 27,000 kilometres she was traveling at ready for landing at less than 760 kilometres the iss was positioned in such a way as to be above the reentry path taken by atlantis so the astronauts were able to observe the entire maneuver from above at 06 08 edt the downlink from the shuttle was acquired by the mila tracking station on merritt island florida with gps data beginning to be accepted by the orbiter three minutes later ten minutes following the first detection of atlantis two sonic booms were heard at kennedy space center as the orbiter dropped below the sound barrier three minutes prior to touchdown commander jett took control of atlantis a minute later and with kennedy space center runway 33 in sight began bringing his ship in for a landing atlantis main gear touched down at 06 21 30 edt on runway 33 at the space shuttle landing facility at kennedy space center with the nose gear following 6 seconds later at 06 21 36 edt and 8 million kilometers miles after launch the wheels came to a stop at 06 22 16 edt bringing mission sts 115 to an end the landing was considered a night landing as it took place about 48 minutes before sunrise and as such was the 21st night landing for the space shuttle program it was the 63rd landing at kennedy space center as well as the 27th mission for atlantis post flight edit sts 115 met 48 seconds

and from the space station 41 by day 2 they pinpointed a handful of launch debris events and drew a preliminary conclusion that the effect was minimal 42 later that day nasa agency engineers decided that additional heat shield inspections were not required 43 the preceding only relates to debris shed immediately during or after launch and not the debris observed on 19 september 2006 not mentioned was a large debris event during launch at 48 seconds near max q because it happened on the et side opposite the orbiter it was never a danger to the shuttle by the origin from near the top of the et
