officially classified a tropical depression on about halfway between the lesser antilles and africa 4 the system remained weak as it turned toward the west northwest a hurricane hunters flight indicated some intensification in the system prompting the national hurricane center nhc to initiate advisories on tropical storm inez located about east of martinique 3 with warm water temperatures the storm developed a circular area of convection over its center 2 inez slowed while curving westward around a ridge to its north and quickly intensified 3 reaching hurricane status on 4 on inez

reaching winds of on before striking southeastern cuba near bay 4 when inez was over cuba forecasters had difficulty in predicting the future it was expected that the hurricane would move to the north off the east coast of the united states due to a weakness in the ridge to the north the hurricane drifted west northwestward within light steering currents weakening over the high terrain but later
