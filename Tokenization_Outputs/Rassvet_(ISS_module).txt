pressurized 5 85m 3 rassvet russian lit dawn also known as the mini research module 1 mrm 1 russian 1 and formerly known as the docking cargo module dcm is a component of the international space station iss the design is similar to the mir docking module launched on sts 74 in 1995 rassvet is primarily used for cargo storage and as a docking port for visiting spacecraft it was flown to the iss aboard space shuttle atlantis on the sts 132 mission on may 14 2010 1 and was connected to the iss on may 18 2 the hatch connecting rassvet with the iss was first opened on may 20 3 on 28 june 2010 the soyuz tma 19 spacecraft performed the first docking with the module 4 contents 1 details 2 initial planning 3 purpose 4 design and construction 5 specifications 6 visited spacecraft 7 gallery 8

docked to the nadir port of zarya with help from the ssrms 5 rassvet carried externally attached outfitting equipment from nasa for the nauka multipurpose laboratory module mlm a spare elbow joint for the european robotic arm and a radiator delivering rassvet thus enabled nasa to fulfill its promise to ship 1.4 metric tons to equip the mlm 6 rassvet has two docking units one to attach to the nadir port of the zarya module and one to provide a docking port for a soyuz or progress spacecraft it implements the role of the docking and stowage module from the original iss design russia announced the cancellation of the last of the two planned russian research modules when it announced the plans for rassvet initial planning edit the initial iss plan included a docking and storage module dsm this planned russian element was intended to provide facilities for stowage and an additional docking port and would have been launched to the station on a proton launch vehicle the dsm would have been mounted to zarya s nadir earth facing docking port it would have been similar in size and shape to the zarya module the dsm was cancelled due to russian budgetary constraints for some time but its design was eventually modified into the docking and cargo module rassvet that was to be connected to the same zarya location to provide stowage space and a docking port during the cancellation period it was proposed that a multi purpose module mpm called enterprise should be docked to zarya and later the multipurpose laboratory module mlm was proposed to be located there as well but the enterprise module has since been cancelled and the mlm will be docked to nadir port instead purpose edit rassvet was designed as a solution to two problems facing the iss partners nasa was under contract to carry the mlm outfitting equipment into space the overlapping missions of the progress soyuz and atv spacecraft highlighted the need to have four russian docking ports available on the iss the cancellation of both russian research modules meant that the iss would be left with just three such docking ports after the installation of the permanent multipurpose module in 2011 which made the nadir port of zarya unusable rassvet solved both of these issues nasa did not need to add another payload flight to accommodate the mlm outfitting equipment as it could attach the hardware to the exterior of mrm 1 the iss now had 4 docking ports available on the russian segment the aft port of zvezda the port of pirs later mlm on the nadir port of zvezda the port of mrm 2 on the zenith port of zvezda and the port on mrm 1 on the nadir port of zarya cancellation of the research module thus came to be of less consequence for the iss program as a whole design and construction edit the experiment airlock on the rassvet module the module was designed and built by s p korolev rsc energia from the already made pressurized hull of the mock up for dynamic tests of the canceled science power platform 7 8 on december 17 2009 an antonov an 124 carrying the rassvet module and ground process equipment arrived at the kennedy space center in florida 9 upon unloading the equipment was delivered to a prelaunch processing facility run by the astrotech energia specialists and technicians continued their work on the processing of the rassvet module at the facility completing stand alone electrical tests and leak tests of the module and the airlock they also prepared the airlock and the radiative heat exchanger for installation onto rassvet the module was moved to space station processing facility on april 2 2010 after completing the final touches it was placed into the shuttle payload transporter on april 5 2010 the payload canister containing the rassvet module arrived at launch pad 39a on april 15 2010 10 engineers at launch pad 39a preparing space shuttle atlantis had noticed paint peeling from the mrm 1 module although the problem was declared to have no impact on the operation of rassvet it posed a potential threat of releasing debris on orbit 11 specifications edit the soyuz tma 19 spacecraft docks to the rassvet mini research module 1 source 12 module launch
