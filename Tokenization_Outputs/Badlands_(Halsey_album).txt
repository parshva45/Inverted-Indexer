state of mind while writing the album to give a physical place as a metaphor for a desolate and lonely mind 3 musically the album is mainly rooted in electropop 4 5 6 alternative pop 7 and synth pop 8 and features industrial undertones 4 production edit according to halsey badlands is a concept album that focuses on the fictional dystopian society known as the badlands the city is surrounded by a desert wasteland keeping the inhabitants of the badlands captive 9 the album was inspired by post apocalyptic movies such as the fifth element after writing the first few songs halsey came to the realization that the entire concept was a metaphor for her mental state halsey states that she created the badlands as an escape from her real life struggles in her opinion the metaphor was that even with no escape there is still optimism that there is somewhere else to go 9 the album was executive produced by lido 10 singles edit ghost was released as debut single on october 27 2014 with an
