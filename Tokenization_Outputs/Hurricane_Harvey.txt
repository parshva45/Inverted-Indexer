force to areas affected by the hurricane for humanitarian operations working alongside the texas national guard 159 israel pledged $1 million in relief funds for restoration of non state run communal infrastructure 160 mexico sent volunteers from the mexican red cross firemen from coahuila and rescue teams from guanajuato to houston to assist in relief 161 mexico later rescinded their commitment for aid after hurricane katia made landfall on gulf coast on september 9 2017 162 venezuela offered $5 million through the state owned citgo petroleum which operates a refinery in corpus christi 163 health and environmental hazards in flood waters edit the floodwaters contain a number of hazards to the environment and human health the houston health department stated that millions of contaminants were present in floodwaters 164 these include e coli and coliform bacteria measurements of colony forming units showed the concentrations were so high that there were risks of contracting flesh eating disease from the water 165 houston officials stated that the houston drinking water and sewer systems were intact however hundreds of thousands of people across the 38 texas counties affected by hurricane harvey use private wells according to an estimate by louisiana state university researchers and those people must fend for themselves 164 additionally harris county which includes houston contains a large number of superfund designed brownfield sites that contain a wide variety of toxins and carcinogens 164 two superfund sites in corpus christi were flooded 164 environmental factors edit the geography of houston places it in a low lying part of the gulf coastal plain and its clay based soils provide poor drainage the climate of houston brings very heavy rainfall which together with tidal flood events means that there have been repeated floods in the city ever since its founding in 1836 though the flood control district founded in 1947 aided by the u s army corps of engineers managed to prevent statewide flooding for over fifty years more recently residents died in historic flooding in may 2015 and in the april 2016 tax day floods 166 167 there is a tendency for storms to move very slowly over the region and drop huge amounts of rain over an extended period as occurred during tropical storm claudette in 1979 and tropical storm allison in 2001 168 the area is a very flat flood plain at shallow gradient slowly draining rainwater through an intricate network of channels and bayous to the sea the main waterways the san jacinto river and the buffalo bayou meander slowly laden with mud and have little capacity for carrying storm water 169 urban development edit houston has seen rapid urban development urban sprawl with absorbent prairie and wetlands replaced by hard surfaces which rapidly shed storm water overwhelming the drainage capacity of the rivers and channels 170 between 1992 and 2010 almost 25,000 acres of wetlands were lost decreasing the detention capacity of the region by four billion gallons 171 however harvey was estimated to have dropped more than fifteen trillion gallons of water in the area 172 the katy prairie in western harris county which once helped to absorb floodwaters in the region has been reduced to one quarter of its previous size in the last several decades due to suburban development and one analysis discovered that more than 7,000 housing units have been built within the 100 year floodplain in harris county since 2010 173 subsidence edit extraction of oil and groundwater from underground aquifers leaves unsupported voids resulting in ground collapse a process called subsidence houston itself is in a very large subsidence bowl with smaller bowls within that area showing greater subsidence in some cases as much as 9 feet these result in drainage systems no longer having the required gradient to operate efficiently so storm water drains more slowly 174 the coastline near houston has seen sea level increasing by 6 inches in recent decades due to subsidence combined with the effects of climate change 175 174 climate change edit see also tropical cyclone change the gulf of mexico is known for hurricanes in august so their incidence alone cannot be attributed to global warming but the warming climate does influence certain attributes of storms studies in this regard show that storms tend to intensify more rapidly prior to landfall 176 weather events are due to multiple factors and so cannot be said to be caused by one precondition but climate change affects aspects of extreme events and very likely worsened some of the impacts of harvey 177 in a briefing the world meteorological organization stated that the quantity of rainfall from harvey had very likely been increased by climate change the relationship between climate change and the frequency of hurricanes or tropical cyclones is still unclear and is the subject of continuing research 178 harvey approached houston over sea surface waters which were significantly above average temperatures warm waters provide the main source of energy for hurricanes and increased ocean heat can result in storms being larger more intense and longer lasting in particular bringing greatly increased rainfall 179 176 sea level rise added to the resulting problems 177 according to officials from the harris county flood control district harvey caused the third 500 year flood in three years 180 181 182 the national climate assessment states the recent increases in activity are linked in part to higher sea surface temperatures in the region that atlantic hurricanes form in and move through numerous factors have been shown to influence these local sea surface temperatures including natural variability human induced emissions of heat trapping gases and particulate pollution quantifying the relative contributions of natural and human caused factors is an active focus of research 183 warmer air can hold more water vapour in accordance with the relation and there has been a global increase of daily rainfall records 177 regional sea surface temperatures around houston have risen around in recent decades which caused a increase in moisture in the atmosphere this had the effect of allowing harvey to strengthen more than expected 175 the water temperature of the gulf of mexico was above average for this time of the year and likely to be a factor in impact 184 within a week of harvey hurricane irma formed due to the same unusually warm sea water some scientists fear this may be becoming a new normal also higher sea water temperatures can make hurricanes more devastating 185 the slow movement of harvey over texas allowed the storm to drop prolonged heavy rains on the state as has also happened with earlier storms 168 stalled position was due to weak prevailing winds linked to a greatly expanded subtropical high pressure system over much of the us at the time which had pushed the jet stream to the north research and model simulations have indicated an association between this pattern and human caused climate change 175 186 see also edit wikimedia commons has media related to
