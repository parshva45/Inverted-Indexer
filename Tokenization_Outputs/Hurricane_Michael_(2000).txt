atlantic canada part of the 2000 atlantic hurricane season hurricane michael of the 2000 atlantic hurricane season caused moderate damage in atlantic canada the seventeenth tropical cyclone thirteenth named storm and eighth hurricane of the season michael developed from a non tropical system to the southwest of bermuda on the system was initially subtropical but rapidly acquired tropical characteristics by michael quickly strengthened into a hurricane later that day by michael peaked as a hurricane on the saffir simpson hurricane wind scale at a relatively high altitude of the storm weakened slightly to a hurricane and became extratropical shortly before making landfall in newfoundland on as the intensity of michael was equivalent to a hurricane during landfall high winds were reported throughout atlantic canada especially in newfoundland winds from the storm peaked at in st lawrence newfoundland other locations across the island reported winds of 128 to 80 to high winds caused minor structure damage across newfoundland confined to vinyl siding peeled off shattered windows and unroofed houses in addition sporadic power outages were also reported from corner brook to st michael also dropped rainfall across atlantic canada and in maine the rainfall was generally light with much of the region reporting between 25 to 51 mm 0.98 to 2.01 in of precipitation michael also produced high tides accompanied by waves reported as high as by a buoy well offshore of newfoundland contents 1 meteorological history 2 impact 2.1 newfoundland 2.2 elsewhere 3 see also 4 references 5 external links meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the scale the system originated out of a non tropical cold core upper level low that drifted southward into the subtropics the low interacted with a cold front which resulted in the development of a stationary front over the bahamas on as the cold low drifted southward a surface low developed on the surface low remained mostly stationary until early on as it merged with the upper level low and deepened while north of the bahamas and east of the coast of florida later that day the system gained enough tropical characteristics and became organized enough to be classified as a subtropical depression the storm remained stationary over warm water with sea surface temperatures around 28 82 while it continued to gain additional tropical characteristics around 0000 utc on it strengthened into a subtropical storm after satellite classifications showed a stronger storm later that day the cyclone continued to develop as more thunderstorms formed and persisted near the low level circulation 1 hurricane michael intensifying over the gulf stream on october 18 by 0000 utc on the transition was completed and michael was reclassified as a tropical storm as supported by satellite classifications via the dvorak technique 1 shortly thereafter the national hurricane center initiated advisories on tropical depression seventeen 2 post analysis later discovered it was actually a tropical storm 1 a well defined eye quickly developed early on as michael began to strengthen and continued to organize 3 that afternoon michael rapidly intensified further and was upgraded to a hurricane as reconnaissance flights found winds of at that point michael began to move northward 4 while michael was maintaining minimal hurricane status the eye remained ragged yet well defined 5 early on michael briefly strengthened to before weakening slightly six hours later tracking into cooler water michael began its extratropical transition while accelerating to the northeast towards newfoundland which prevented significant weakening the acceleration was caused by a shortwave trough embedded within strong southwesterly mid level flow 1 unexpectedly michael began to rapidly intensify on while in extratropical transition later that day a ship report in the eastern eyewall reported a minimum central pressure of 965 mbar 28.5 inhg and maximum sustained winds of making michael a hurricane on the saffir simpson hurricane scale 6 the sudden intensification was determined to have been as a result of baroclinic effects as it interacted with an incoming trough which provided additional energy to counter the general weakening of hurricanes while in the high latitudes over sea surface temperatures around 7 michael formed a hybrid system combining influences of a hurricane with that of a powerful extratropical cyclone 1 at 2300 utc on michael made landfall near parsons harbour newfoundland with winds of shortly thereafter michael transitioned into an extratropical storm 1 8 the extratropical system gradually weakened as it tracked across newfoundland on and slowed down considerably with the presence of the trough the storm was absorbed by another extratropical low just north of newfoundland that afternoon 1 impact edit rain accumulations with michael because it was unknown that michael became extratropical before landfall it was the initially considered the first tropical cyclone to strike newfoundland since hurricane luis in 1995 9 furthermore michael was also considered the first hurricane to make landfall in canada since hurricane hortense in 1996 10 when the meteorological service of canada and the national research council flew a convair research flight into michael on it was the first successful research flight made into a tropical cyclone by those agencies subsequent flights have been made into tropical storm karen hurricane isabel while

warnings storm warnings and hurricane warnings throughout newfoundland rainfall advisories were also issued in portions of the east coast central newfoundland the south coast and the west coast offshore storm force wind warnings were declared on for newfoundland waters several special weather statements were also posted 7 light to moderate damage was reported throughout newfoundland primarily as a result of the strong winds the entire region was affected by michael though the majority of the damage was confined to small communities east of where the storm made landfall including gaultois harbour breton hermitage and english harbour west these areas reported significant power outages and minor structural damage vinyl siding was peeled off windows were shattered and roof shingles were torn off in some localized locations the most severe damage was in gaultois where several roofs were torn off and trees were uprooted 7 wind damage also occurred in the st metropolitan area where a sobeys store in conception bay south had broken windows 13 sporadic power outages were reported throughout the island as far east as st and as far west as corner brook as the storm struck at low tide storm surge was insignificant 7 however just prior to landfall waves on the coast of newfoundland reached heights of 13 rainfall near the track was generally around though further inland precipitation reached 7 rainfall from the hurricane amounted to at englee a small fishing community on the great northern peninsula 13 wind gusts peaked at at st lawrence with other reports varying between and 9 despite severe winds damage was relatively light due to high construction standards in newfoundland where winter storms routinely result in hurricane force winds as well as the sparse population of the area affected 7 the tug atlantic elm lost its tow to the unmanned barge portland star on the barge was carrying over 18,000 tonnes of cement and diesel fuel and was later reported to have sunk in the fortune bay damage was reported to numerous pleasure craft around the bay due to the waves 7 two sailboats were toppled 14 also ferry service between newfoundland and nova scotia was disrupted 7 15 several offshore buoys and ships reported high winds and low barometric pressure 1 as well as waves of up to 9 elsewhere edit on and the frontal boundary associated with the precursor dropped heavy rainfall on bermuda amounting to however as a tropical cyclone michael remained far from the island 16 impact outside newfoundland was generally light however rainfall was greater in some areas of nova scotia than in newfoundland where precipitation reached over north mountain light rain was also reported in new brunswick prince edward island and quebec effects from the storm in
