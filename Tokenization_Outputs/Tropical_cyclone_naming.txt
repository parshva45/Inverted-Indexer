warnings the names are intended to reduce confusion in the event of concurrent storms in the same basin generally once storms produce sustained wind speeds of more than 33 knots names are assigned in order from predetermined lists depending on which basin they originate however standards vary from basin to basin some tropical depressions are named in the western pacific while tropical cyclones must have a significant amount of gale force winds occurring around the centre before they are named in the southern hemisphere before the formal start of naming tropical cyclones were named after places objects or saints feast days on which they occurred the credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the queensland government meteorologist clement wragge who named systems between 1887 and 1907 this system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after wragge retired until it was revived in the latter part of
