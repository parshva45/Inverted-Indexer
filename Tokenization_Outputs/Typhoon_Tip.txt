peninsula japan northeast china russian far east alaska part of the 1979 pacific typhoon season typhoon tip known in the philippines as typhoon warling was the largest and most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded the nineteenth storm and twelfth typhoon of the 1979 pacific typhoon season tip developed out of a disturbance from the monsoon trough on near pohnpei initially a tropical storm to the northwest hindered the development and motion of tip though after it tracked farther north tip was able to intensify after passing guam tip rapidly intensified and reached peak winds of nb 1 and a worldwide record low sea level pressure of 870 mbar 870.0 hpa 25.69 inhg on at its peak strength it was also the largest tropical cyclone on record with a wind diameter of tip slowly weakened as it continued west northwestward and later turned to the northeast in response to an approaching trough the typhoon made landfall in southern japan on and became an extratropical cyclone shortly thereafter u s air force aircraft flew 60 weather reconnaissance missions into the typhoon making tip one of the most closely observed tropical cyclones 1 rainfall from tip indirectly led to a fire that killed 13 marines and injured 68 at combined arms training center camp fuji in the shizuoka prefecture of japan 2 elsewhere in the country the typhoon caused widespread flooding and offshore

plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the scale three circulations developed within the monsoon trough that extended from the philippines to the marshall islands at the beginning of october 1979 the westernmost disturbance developed into typhoon sarah west of luzon on october 1 on a disturbance southwest of guam developed into tropical storm roger and later on the same day a third tropical disturbance that would later become typhoon tip formed south of pohnpei strong flow from across the equator was drawn into wind circulation initially preventing significant development of the precursor disturbance to tip despite the unfavorable air pattern the tropical disturbance gradually organized as it moved westward due to the large scale circulation pattern of tropical storm roger precursor moved erratically and slowly executed a cyclonic loop to the southeast of chuuk a reconnaissance aircraft flight into the system late on confirmed the existence of a closed low level circulation and early on the joint typhoon warning center jtwc issued its first warning on tropical depression twenty three 1 global satellite image of typhoon tip near peak strength and typhoon sarah heading toward vietnam while executing a loop near chuuk the tropical depression intensified into tropical storm tip though the storm failed to organize significantly due to the influence of tropical storm roger reconnaissance aircraft provided the track of the surface circulation since satellite imagery estimated the center was about from its true position after drifting erratically for several days tip began a steady northwest motion on by that time tropical storm roger had become an extratropical cyclone resulting in the southerly flow to be entrained into tip an area of a tropical upper tropospheric trough moved north of guam at the time providing an excellent outflow channel north of tip initially tip was predicted to continue northwestward and make landfall on guam though it turned to the west early on passing about south of guam later that day tip intensified to attain typhoon status 1 owing to very favorable conditions for development typhoon tip rapidly intensified over the open waters of the western pacific ocean late on tip attained wind speeds equal to strength on the hurricane scale and it became a super typhoon the next day the central pressure dropped by 92 mbar from to 11 during which the circulation pattern of typhoon tip expanded to a record diameter of tip continued to intensify further and early on reconnaissance aircraft recorded a worldwide record low pressure of with winds of when tip was located about west northwest of guam 1 in its best track the japan meteorological agency listed tip as peaking with 10 minute sustained winds of 3 at the time of its peak strength its eye was wide 1 tip crossed the 135th meridian east on the afternoon of prompting the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration to issue warnings on typhoon tip assigning it the local name warling after peaking intensity tip weakened to and remained at that intensity for several days as it continued west northwestward for five days after its peak strength the average radius of winds stronger than extended over on tip began to weaken steadily and decrease in size recurving northeastward under the influence of a mid level trough the next day after passing about east of okinawa the typhoon accelerated to tip made landfall on the japanese island of with winds of about on it continued rapidly northeastward through the country and became an extratropical cyclone over northern a few hours after moving ashore 1 the extratropical remnant of tip proceeded northeastward and gradually weakened crossing the international date line on the

typhoon best track analysis information for the north western pacific ocean 4 the typhoon produced heavy rainfall early in its lifetime while passing near guam including a total of at andersen air force base 1 the outer rainbands of the large circulation of tip produced moderate rainfall in the mountainous regions of the philippine island of luzon 5 heavy rainfall from the typhoon breached a flood retaining wall at camp fuji a training facility for the united states marine corps near yokosuka 6 marines inside the camp weathered the storm inside huts situated at the base of a hill which housed a fuel farm the breach led to hoses being dislodged from two rubber storage bladders releasing large quantities of fuel the fuel flowed down the hill and was ignited by a heater used to warm one of the huts 7 8 9 the resultant fire killed 13 marines injured 68 1 and caused moderate damage to the facility the barracks were destroyed 6 along with fifteen huts and several other structures 7

gusts to sustained wind velocities in japan are not known though they were estimated at minimal typhoon strength the passage of the typhoon through the region resulted in millions of dollars in damage to the agricultural and fishing industries of the country 1 eight ships were grounded or sunk by tip leaving dead or unaccounted for a chinese freighter broke in half as a result of the typhoon though its crew of 46 were rescued 5 the rainfall led to over 600 mudslides throughout the mountainous regions of japan and flooded more than died throughout the country with another and 5 river embankments broke in 70 places destroying 27 bridges while about 105 dikes were destroyed following the storm at least 11,000 people were left homeless tip destroyed apple rice peach and other crops five ships sank in heavy seas off the coast and 50 story buildings swayed in the capital tokyo 11 12 transportation in the country was disrupted 200 trains and 160 domestic flights were canceled 13 tip was

record with a pressure of lower than the previous record set by super typhoon june in 1975 1 19 20 the records set by tip still technically stand though with the end of routine reconnaissance aircraft flights in the western pacific ocean in august 1987 modern researchers have questioned whether tip indeed remains the strongest after a detailed study three researchers determined that two typhoons angela in 1995 and gay in 1992 registered higher dvorak numbers than tip and concluded that one or both of the two may have therefore been more intense 21 other recent storms may have also been deeper than tip at its peak for instance satellite derived intensity estimates for typhoon haiyan of 2013 indicated that its core pressure may have been as low as 22 due to the dearth of direct observations into these cyclones conclusive data are lacking 21 despite the intensity and damage the name tip was not retired and was reused in 1983 1986 and 1989 3 see also edit tropical cyclones portal hurricane
