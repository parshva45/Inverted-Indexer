two air force units responsible for tropical cyclone reconnaissance and warnings in the pacific 3 over the next few years the coordination of tropical warnings between the centres was at times difficult or impossible due to various communication problems 5 during 1958 the united states department of defense weather services and the weather bureau formed the joint meteorology committee to the pacific command and proposed the formation of a joint navy and air force center for typhoon analysis and forecasting 3 6 a committee was subsequently set up to study the issue which issued a report during january 1959 which gave recommendation that the center be set up 6 based on the report and the conclusions reached at the march 1959 annual tropical cyclone conference the joint meteorology committee formally urged the commander in chief us pacific command cincpac to establish a joint typhoon warning center 6 the cincpac subsequently petitioned the joint chiefs of staff who gave permission for the centre to be set up effective may 1 1959 under the command of the fleet weather commander 5 6 the jtwc initially consisted of ten people with two officers and three enlisted personnel provided by each service 5 it was required to provide warnings on all tropical cyclones between the malay peninsular and the international dateline for us government agencies 5 they also had to determine reconnaissance requirements prepare annual typhoon summaries and conduct research into tropical cyclone forecasting and detection 3 in november 1962 typhoon karen destroyed the building

names and adheres to acknowledged guidelines for intensity of tropical cyclones and tropical storms with the exception of using the u s standard of measuring sustained winds for 1 min instead of the 10 min span recommended by the wmo see saffir simpson hurricane scale the jtwc is not one of the wmo designated regional specialized meteorological centres nor one of its tropical cyclone warning centres as its main mission is to support the united states government agencies 12 jtwc monitors analyzes and forecasts tropical cyclone formation development and movement year round 13 its area of responsibility covers 89% of the tropical cyclone activity 14 staffing edit the center is manned by about 37 u s air force and navy personnel 15 the jtwc uses several satellite systems and sensors
