tropical storm erika of august 2015 was the deadliest natural disaster in dominica since hurricane david in 1979 the fifth named storm of the season erika developed from a westward moving tropical wave while well east of the lesser antilles hostile conditions including dry air and wind shear inhibited significant development and erika failed to acquire sustained winds beyond contrary to predictions of a northwesterly recurvature the cyclone persisted on a westerly course and passed through the leeward islands and emerged over the caribbean sea on erika succumbed to adverse conditions the following day dissipating as a tropical cyclone near the dominican republic the remnant system persisted for several more days ultimately moving across the gulf of mexico before dissipating over georgia on several islands experienced heavy rainfall during the passage of erika especially dominica the asymmetric structure coupled with the mountainous terrain of the island and ample moisture aloft led to rainfall accumulations up to with grounds already saturated from antecedent rains tremendous runoff quickly overwhelmed river basins and triggered catastrophic floods accompanying mudslides worsened the situation temporarily damming the rivers before collapsing hundreds of homes were left uninhabitable and thousands of people were displaced the entire town of petite savanne was evacuated and subsequently abandoned as a result of the storm all told died across the island in the worst disaster since hurricane david the devastating effects in dominica prompted an influx of international assistance aid from multiple nations and intergovernmental organizations poured in to assist victims of the storm thousands of homes needed to be built or repaired including for the

2015 the national hurricane center nhc began monitoring a tropical wave over western africa near the atlantic shore 2 the disorganized system emerged over the atlantic ocean several hundred miles southeast of the cape verde islands the following day 3 4 moving quickly west the system bypassed the cape verde islands to the south on 5 but remained largely disorganized a sharp trough developed within expanding deep convection on though a well defined circulation did not consolidate 3 organization of the low improved throughout the day as environmental conditions favored tropical cyclogenesis 6 the trough acquired gale force winds the following day and finally developed a closed circulation by 18 00 utc the formation of a closed low marked the transition into a tropical cyclone accordingly the system was classified as tropical storm erika the fifth named storm of the annual hurricane season upon its designation erika was situated roughly east of the lesser antilles 3 the storm maintained a brisk westward trajectory steered by a subtropical ridge to the north 3 7 at the time of classification forecast models diverged significantly on the potential future of erika statistical guidance and the hwrf depicted a hurricane while the ecmwf and gfs showed a weaker system due to increasing wind shear the models that intensified the storm indicated a more northerly track while those that kept it weaker had the system continuing along a westward course accordingly the nhc noted low confidence in their five day forecast for erika 7 this uncertainty ultimately reflected in above average forecast errors when compared to all tropical cyclones but roughly average for weak poorly organized systems 8 throughout and into early the convective organization of erika fluctuated due to wind shear and entrainment of dry air periodically leaving the center of circulation devoid of convection 9 early on erika managed to intensify slightly attaining its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of and a barometric pressure of 1001 mbar hpa 29.56 inhg 3 around the disorganized center of erika passed over the northern tip of guadeloupe before emerging over the eastern caribbean sea 3 official forecast positions top left and various forecast models for erika versus its best track positions black lines note the consistent northerly bias present in all outputs convection remained poorly organized and mostly confined to eastern portions of the cyclone as it traversed the eastern caribbean sea 10 multiple circulation centers were noted during the overnight of all rotating around a broad general center one such center moved over st croix and produced gale force gusts environmental conditions ahead of the storm became increasingly hostile and forecasters at the nhc continued to note unusually high uncertainty in their forecasts 11 further structural degradation ensued on as erika approached the dominican republic based on data from hurricane hunters erika degenerated into a broad area of low longer meeting the definition of a tropical after near the southeastern coast of the dominican republic 3 operationally the nhc maintained advisories on erika until on 12 it was also noted during those advisories that the center was completely devoid of convection and whatever convection remained was reduced to the eastern half of the system 13 around on the remnants of erika made landfall along the southeastern coast of the dominican republic 14 the disheveled system emerged over the windward passage early on 13 thereafter the system skirted the northern coast of cuba and entered the gulf of mexico on turning northward the disturbance eventually crossed northern florida on before dissipating over georgia the following day 3 preparations edit

hurricane david in 1979 50 51 across the rugged terrain the mudslides temporarily dammed overflowing rivers creating a buildup of water these earthen dams subsequently collapsed leading to amplified
