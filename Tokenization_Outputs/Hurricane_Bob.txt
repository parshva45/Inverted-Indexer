storm and first hurricane of the 1991 atlantic hurricane season bob developed from an area of low pressure near the bahamas on august 16 the depression steadily intensified and became tropical storm bob late on august 16 bob curved north northwestward as a tropical storm but re curved to the north northeast after becoming a hurricane on august 17 as such it brushed the outer banks of north carolina on august 18 and august 19 and subsequently intensified into a major hurricane category 3 or greater on the saffir simpson hurricane scale after peaking in intensity with maximum sustained winds of bob weakened slightly as it approached the coast of new england bob made landfall twice in rhode island as a category 2 hurricane on august 19 first on block island and then in newport upon doing so it became the only hurricane to make landfall in the contiguous united states during the 1991 season moving further inland bob rapidly weakened and deteriorated to a tropical storm while emerging into the gulf of maine shortly thereafter bob made landfall in maine as a strong tropical storm early on august 20 bob entered the canadian province of new brunswick a few hours later where

originated from the remnants of a frontal trough to the southeast of bermuda on the system tracked towards the southwest and later west towards the bahamas by satellite analysis of the system found a weak low pressure area a couple hundred miles east of the bahamas 2 operationally the system was not declared a tropical depression until on after a reconnaissance mission into the storm found a closed circulation and flight level winds of 3 after post storm analysis it was determined that the low had developed into a depression around several hours after being designated the system began to develop convective banding features roughly after being declared a depression the national hurricane center nhc upgraded it to a tropical storm giving it the name bob at this time bob was situated roughly northeast of nassau bahamas the storm tracked slowly towards the northwest in response to the deep layer mean flow it was embedded within 2 a deepening trough over the eastern united states was forecast to turn the storm toward the north on this turn took place earlier than forecasters anticipated 4 the storm slowly intensified as convection was displaced from the center of circulation however upper level outflow was well defined and intensification of the storm was expected as it tracked over the gulf stream 5 later that day bob began to consolidate and a reconnaissance plane recorded hurricane force winds at following this reading the nhc upgraded the storm to a category 1 hurricane on the hurricane scale 2 shortly after the hurricane began to turn towards the north northeast in response to a subtropical ridge over the atlantic and the trough over the southeastern united states 6 by the nhc noted that the hurricane was asymmetrical having uneven distribution of the wind radii 7 later that day deep convection continued to form and an eye later appeared on satellite imagery early the next day the eye became increasingly defined as the center of bob passed roughly from the north carolina coastline by hurricane hunters recorded flight level winds of corresponding to surface winds of at this time the barometric pressure of the storm also decreased to hpa the lowest pressure recorded during the storm after attaining this intensity the hurricane tracked quickly northeast at steered by the trough over the southeast united states an upper level cutoff low over the great lakes region and the subtropical ridge over the atlantic 6 hurricane bob near peak intensity the track of hurricane bob by was similar to that of hurricane carol in 1954 another major hurricane that impacted new england 6 significantly cooler sea surface temperatures in the path of the hurricane resulted in weakening leading to the eye becoming cloud filled later on the western portion of the eyewall brushed the eastern tip of long island around the center of bob made landfall near newport rhode island with winds of making it a category 2 hurricane the storm quickly weakened as it tracked through rhode island and massachusetts before entering the gulf of maine around on the now weakened tropical storm bob made another landfall near rockport maine with winds of 6 later that day bob had crossed through maine and part of new brunswick canada and entered the gulf of st lawrence around the former hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone early the next day the storm passed over northern newfoundland before re entering the atlantic ocean rapidly tracking eastward the storm briefly weakened to the equivalent of a tropical depression on after restrengthening to tropical storm force winds the remnants of bob turned towards the southeast and slowed once more the extratropical system weakened to the equivalent of a tropical depression however it did not re intensify the storm slowly tracked towards the east before dissipating off the coast of portugal on 6 preparations edit rainfall from hurricane bob in the united states watches and warnings edit several hours after the declaration of tropical storm bob on the government of the bahamas issued a tropical storm warning for the northwestern bahamas between the islands of andros and

repairing damaged public buildings and other municipal expenses for each of the states despite the declaration the federal government did not immediately provide aid to the affected region this was partially due to president bush considering the storm a disaster but not an emergency which therefore required cuts from other budgets to offset the relief aid this was in opposition to the democratic
