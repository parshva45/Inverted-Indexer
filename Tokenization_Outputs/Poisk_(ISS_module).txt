poisk iss module wikipedia poisk iss module from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search diagram of the poisk mrm 2 iss module poisk docking module at the space station prior to the separation of its propulsion compartment yelena serova works on an experiment in poisk poisk russian lit search also known as the mini research module 2 mrm 2 2 or 2 is a docking module of the international space station its original name was docking module 2 stykovochniy otsek 2 so 2 as it is almost identical to the pirs docking compartment added in 2009 poisk was the first major russian addition to the international space station since 2001 1 poisk is overall the same design as a docking module pirs 2 whereas pirs has been attached to the nadir bottom port of zvezda module poisk is attached to the zenith top pirs is closer to the earth with the iss in its usual orientation and poisk is on the other side poisk is russian for explore or search 3 4 poisk combines various docking eva and science capabilities 5 it has two egress hatches for in addition to the two spacecraft docking ports 6 although poisk is designated as mini research module 2 it arrived before mini research module 1 rassvet which had a different design poisk looks more like the pirs docking port which is not designated as a mini research module contents 1 details 2 design and construction 3 launch in

looks out of a poisk window at someone on eva mrm 2 in russian can be seen written in black script on the inside of the hatch poisk docked to the zenith port of the zvezda module on november 12 2009 and will serve as a docking port for soyuz and progress spacecraft and as an airlock for spacewalks poisk will also provide extra space for scientific experiments and provide power supply outlets and data transmission interfaces for two external scientific payloads to be developed by the russian academy of sciences two spacewalks conducted from the iss in june 2009 successfully completed activities anticipating poisk future berthing on 5 june 2009 during russian orlan eva 22 spacewalk 7 expedition 19/20 commander gennady padalka and flight engineer michael barratt installed two kurs docking antennas a docking target and electrical connectors on the exterior of service module on june 10 2009 during russian orlan eva 23 spacewalk 8 padalka and barratt replaced a flat hatch cover in the forward section of zvezda with a standard conical docking cone cover to allow for docking on january 14 2010 cosmonauts oleg kotov and maksim suraev conducted a spacewalk to outfit the poisk module to prepare for receiving soyuz and progress ships in the future 9 they deployed antennas and a docking target installed two handrails and plugged the new kurs antennas into the kurs docking system circuitry 10 the spacewalk lasted five hours and 44 minutes on january 21 2010 the module was first used when cosmonaut suraev and expedition 22 commander jeffrey williams relocated their soyuz tma 16 spacecraft from the aft port of the zvezda module to the zenith facing port of the poisk module 11 the soyuz tma 16 spacecraft undocked from the aft end of the zvezda service module at 10 03 utc and backed away to a distance of about 30m 100 feet from the space station undocking occurred as the station flew about 343 km 213 miles high off the southwest coast of africa re docking occurred at 10 24 utc after suraev fired the soyuz maneuvering thrusters to fly halfway around the orbiting space station and line up with the poisk module design and construction edit the module was designed and built by s p korolev rsc energia 12 13 14 the leading organization engaged in the development and operational use of the iss russian segment launch in 2009 edit poisk arriving at the iss the propulsion compartment of the poisk module departs the module was launched on november 10 2009 2 22 p m gmt 15 16 attached to a modified progress spacecraft called progress m mim2 on a soyuz u rocket from launch pad 1 at the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan the occasion also marked the 1750th launch of a soyuz rocket in its various configurations 17 about eight minutes after launch the three stage soyuz rocket delivered poisk to a low altitude injection orbit according to nasa poisk carried about 816kg 1800 pounds of cargo to the iss including new russian orlan spacesuits life support equipment medical supplies and crew hygiene items the progress space tug provided electrical power and propulsion for the poisk module during its two day journey to the space station on 12 november progress began its automated final approach to the station on a kurs rendezvous radar system and at 15 41 utc 18 poisk docked to the zvezda zenith port the docking happened as the space station sailed more than 354km 220 miles over northern kazakhstan cosmonauts maksim suraev and roman romanenko entered the module for the first time by opening the hatch leading into poisk at 12 17 utc on 13 november 2009 the jettisoning of the progress ship from the poisk module happened around 8 december 2009 the progress was destroyed during re entry into the atmosphere specifications edit poisk after

shuttle atlantis and the space station at 01 36 utc on 20 november 2009 and once again at 02 53 utc on 21 november 20 21 an erroneous indication of a rapid depressurization led to the automatic shutdown of ventilation fans throughout the station which stirred up dust and led to a false smoke detection alarm in the european space columbus laboratory mission control capcom frank lien in
