hopetoun falls australia lightning strikes during the eruption of the galunggung volcano west java in 1982 roads in kerala nature in the broadest sense is the natural physical or material world or universe nature can refer to the phenomena of the physical world and also to life in general the study of nature is a large part of science although humans are part of nature human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena the word nature is derived from the latin word natura or essential qualities innate disposition and in ancient times literally meant birth 1 natura is a latin translation of the greek word physis which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants animals and other features of the world develop of their own accord 2 3 the concept of nature as a whole the physical universe is one of several expansions of the original notion it began with certain core applications of the word by pre socratic philosophers and has steadily gained currency ever since this usage continued during the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries 4 5 within the various uses of the word today nature often refers to geology and wildlife nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord such as the weather and geology of the earth it is often taken to mean the natural environment or wilderness animals rocks forest and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention or which persist despite human intervention for example manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature unless qualified as for example human nature or the whole of nature this more traditional concept of natural things which can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind depending on the particular context the term natural might also be distinguished from the unnatural or the supernatural contents 1 earth 1.1 geology 1.1.1 geological evolution 1.2 historical perspective 2 atmosphere climate and weather 3 water on earth 3.1 oceans 3.2 lakes 3.2.1

its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research within the solar system it is third closest to the sun it is the largest terrestrial planet and the fifth largest overall its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions two relatively narrow temperate zones and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region 6 precipitation varies widely with location from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre 71 percent of the surface is covered by salt water oceans the remainder consists of continents and islands with most of the inhabited land in the northern hemisphere earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions the outer surface is divided into several gradually migrating tectonic plates the interior remains active with a thick layer of plastic mantle and an iron filled core that generates a magnetic field this iron core is composed of a solid inner phase and a fluid outer phase convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action and these in turn generate the geomagnetic field the atmospheric conditions have been significantly altered from the original conditions by the presence of life forms 7 which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions despite the wide regional variations in climate by latitude and other geographic factors the long term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods 8 and variations of a degree or two of average global temperature have historically had major effects on the ecological balance and on the actual geography of the earth 9 10 geology edit main article geology geology is the science and study of the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the earth the field of geology encompasses the study of the composition structure physical properties dynamics and history of earth materials and the processes by which they are formed moved and changed the field is a major academic discipline and is also important for mineral and hydrocarbon extraction knowledge about and mitigation of natural hazards some geotechnical engineering fields and understanding past climates and environments geological evolution edit three types of geological plate tectonic boundaries the geology of an area evolves through time as rock units are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and locations rock units are first emplaced either by deposition onto the surface or intrude into the overlying rock deposition can occur when sediments settle onto the surface of the earth and later lithify into sedimentary rock or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash or lava flows blanket the surface igneous intrusions such as batholiths laccoliths dikes and sills push upwards into the overlying rock and crystallize as they intrude after the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited the rock units can be deformed and or metamorphosed deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening horizontal extension or side to side strike slip motion these structural regimes broadly relate to convergent boundaries divergent boundaries and transform boundaries respectively between tectonic plates historical perspective edit main articles history of the earth and evolution an animation showing the movement of the continents from the separation of pangaea until the present day earth is estimated to have formed years ago from the solar nebula along with the sun and other planets 11 the moon formed roughly years later initially molten the outer layer of the earth cooled resulting in the solid crust outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere condensing water vapor most or all of which came from ice delivered by comets produced the oceans and other water sources 12 the highly energetic chemistry is believed to have produced a self replicating molecule around years ago 13 plankton inhabit oceans seas and lakes and have existed in various forms for at least years 14 continents formed then broke up and reformed as the surface of earth reshaped over hundreds of millions of years occasionally combining to make a supercontinent roughly years ago the earliest known supercontinent rodinia began to break apart the continents later recombined to form pannotia which broke apart about years ago then finally pangaea which broke apart about years ago 15 during the neoproterozoic era covered much of the earth in glaciers and ice sheets this hypothesis has been termed the snowball earth and it is of particular interest as it precedes the cambrian explosion in which multicellular life forms began to proliferate about years ago 16 since the cambrian explosion there have been five distinctly identifiable mass extinctions 17 the last mass extinction occurred some 66 million years ago when a meteorite collision probably triggered the extinction of the non avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles but spared small animals such as mammals over the past years mammalian life diversified 18 several million years ago a species of small african ape gained the ability to stand upright 14 the subsequent advent of human life and the development of agriculture and further civilization allowed humans to affect the earth more rapidly than any previous life form affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate by comparison the great oxygenation event produced by the proliferation of algae during the siderian period required about years to culminate the present era is classified as part of a mass extinction event the holocene extinction event the fastest ever to have occurred 19 20 some such as e o wilson of harvard university predict that human destruction of the biosphere could cause the extinction of one half of all species in the next 21 the extent of the current extinction event is still being researched debated and calculated by biologists 22 23 24 atmosphere climate and weather edit blue light is scattered more than other wavelengths by the gases in the atmosphere giving the earth a blue halo when seen from space main articles atmosphere of earth climate and weather the atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the ecosystem the thin layer of gases that envelops the earth is held in place by gravity air is mostly nitrogen oxygen water vapor with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide argon etc the atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude the ozone layer plays an important role in depleting the amount of ultraviolet uv radiation that reaches the surface as dna is readily damaged by uv light this serves to protect life at the surface the atmosphere also retains heat during the night thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the lower part of the atmosphere and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat 25 ocean currents are another important factor in determining climate particularly the major underwater thermohaline circulation which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions these currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones also without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere the tropics would be much hotter and the polar regions much colder lightning weather can have both beneficial and harmful effects extremes in weather such as tornadoes or hurricanes and cyclones can expend large amounts of energy along their paths and produce devastation surface vegetation has evolved a dependence on the seasonal variation of the weather and sudden changes lasting only a few years can have a dramatic effect both on the vegetation and on the animals which depend on its growth for their food climate is a measure of the long term trends in the weather various factors are known to influence the climate including ocean currents surface albedo greenhouse gases variations in the solar luminosity and changes to the orbit based on historical records the earth is known to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past including ice ages a tornado in central oklahoma the climate of a region depends on a number of factors especially latitude a latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region there are a number of such regions ranging from the tropical climate at the equator to the polar climate in the northern and southern extremes weather is also influenced by the seasons which result from the earth s axis being tilted relative to its orbital plane thus at any given time during the summer or winter one part of the earth is more directly exposed to the rays of the sun this exposure alternates as the earth revolves in its orbit at any given time regardless of season the northern and southern hemispheres experience opposite seasons weather is a chaotic system that is readily modified by small changes to the environment so accurate weather forecasting is limited to only a few days citation needed overall two things are happening worldwide 1 temperature is increasing on the average and 2 regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes 26 water on earth edit the iguazu falls on the border between brazil and argentina main article water water is a chemical substance that is composed of hydrogen and oxygen and is vital for all known forms of life 27 in typical usage water refers only to its liquid form or state but the substance also has a solid state ice and a gaseous state water vapor or steam water covers 71% of the earth s surface 28 on earth it is found mostly in oceans and other large water bodies with 1.6% of water below ground in aquifers and 0.001% in the air as vapor clouds and precipitation 29 30 oceans hold 97% of surface water glaciers and polar ice caps 2.4 and other land surface water such as rivers lakes and ponds 0.6 additionally a minute amount of the water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products oceans edit a view of the atlantic ocean from leblon rio de janeiro main article ocean an ocean is a major body of saline water and a principal component of the hydrosphere approximately 71% of the surface an area of some 361 million square kilometers is covered by ocean a continuous body of water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas more than half of this area is over 3,000 meters 9,800 feet deep average oceanic salinity is around 35 parts per thousand ppt 3.5 and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt though generally recognized as several separate oceans these waters comprise one global interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the world ocean or global ocean 31 32 this concept of a global ocean as a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to oceanography 33 the major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the continents various archipelagos and other criteria these divisions are in descending order of size the pacific ocean the atlantic ocean the indian ocean the southern ocean and the arctic ocean smaller regions of the oceans are called seas gulfs bays and other names there are also salt lakes which are smaller bodies of landlocked saltwater that are not interconnected with the world ocean two notable examples of salt lakes are the aral sea and the great salt lake lakes edit lake mapourika new zealand main article lake a lake from latin lacus is a terrain feature or physical feature a body of liquid on the surface of a world that is localized to the bottom of basin another type of landform or terrain feature that is it is not global and moves slowly if it moves at all on earth a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland not part of the ocean is larger and deeper than a pond and is fed by a river 34 35 the only world other than earth known to harbor lakes is titan largest moon which has lakes of ethane most likely mixed with methane it is not known if lakes are fed by rivers though surface is carved by numerous river beds natural lakes on earth are generally found in mountainous areas rift zones and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers in some parts of the world there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last ice age all lakes are temporary over geologic time scales as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them ponds edit the westborough reservoir mill pond in westborough massachusetts main article pond a pond is a body of standing water either natural or man made that is usually smaller than a lake a wide variety of man made bodies of water are classified as ponds including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed while currents in streams are easily observed ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro currents and moderate wind driven currents these features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features such as stream pools and tide pools rivers edit the nile river in cairo egypt s capital city main article river a river is a natural watercourse 36 usually freshwater flowing toward an ocean a lake a sea or another river in a few cases a river simply flows into the ground or dries up completely before reaching another body of water small rivers may also be called by several other names including stream creek brook rivulet and rill there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location one example is burn in scotland and north east england sometimes a river is said to be larger than a creek but this is not always the case due to vagueness in the language 37 a river is part of the hydrological cycle water within a river is generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff groundwater recharge springs and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks i e from glaciers streams edit a rocky stream in hawaii main article stream a stream is a flowing body of water with a current confined within a bed and stream banks in the united states a stream is classified as a watercourse less than 60 feet 18 metres wide streams are important as conduits in the water cycle instruments in groundwater recharge and they serve as corridors for fish and wildlife migration the biological habitat in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a riparian zone given the status of the ongoing holocene extinction streams play an important corridor role in connecting fragmented habitats and thus in conserving biodiversity the study of streams and waterways in general involves many branches of inter disciplinary natural science and engineering including hydrology fluvial geomorphology aquatic ecology fish biology riparian ecology and others ecosystems edit loch lomond in scotland forms a relatively isolated ecosystem the fish community of this lake has remained unchanged over a very long period of time 38 lush green aravalli mountain range in the desert country rajasthan india a wonder how such greenery can exist in hot rajasthan a place well known for its thar desert an aerial view of a human ecosystem pictured is the city of chicago main articles ecology and ecosystem ecosystems are composed of a variety of abiotic and biotic components that function in an interrelated way 39 the structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the ecosystem some of the more important components are soil atmosphere radiation from the sun water and living organisms blancas part of the biosphere reserve located northeast of the city of jinotega in northeastern nicaragua central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that living organisms interact with every other element in their local environment eugene odum a founder of ecology stated any unit that includes all of the organisms ie the community in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure biotic diversity and material cycles i e exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts within the system is an ecosystem 40 within the ecosystem species are connected and dependent upon one another in the food chain and exchange energy and matter between themselves as well as with their environment 41 the human ecosystem concept is grounded in the deconstruction of the human nature dichotomy and the premise that all species are ecologically integrated with each other as well as with the abiotic constituents of their biotope citation needed a smaller unit of size is called a microecosystem for example a microsystem can be a stone and all the life under it a macroecosystem might involve a whole ecoregion with its drainage basin 42 wilderness edit old growth european beech forest in biogradska gora national park montenegro main article wilderness wilderness is generally defined as areas that have not been significantly modified by human activity wilderness areas can be found in preserves estates farms conservation preserves ranches national forests national parks and even in urban areas along rivers gulches or otherwise undeveloped areas wilderness areas and protected parks are considered important for the survival of certain species ecological studies conservation solitude and recreation some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity 43 and some ecologists consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of the self sustaining

biological manifestation of life is characterized by organization metabolism growth adaptation response to stimuli and reproduction 44 life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of organisms properties common to terrestrial organisms plants animals fungi protists archaea and bacteria are that they are cellular carbon and water based with complex organization having a metabolism a capacity to grow respond to stimuli and reproduce an entity with these properties is generally considered life however not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential human made analogs of life may also be considered to be life the biosphere is the part of outer including land surface rocks water air and the within which life occurs and which biotic processes in turn alter or transform from the broadest geophysiological point of view the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships including their interaction

environments within the biosphere 45 over nine tenths of the total biomass on earth is plant life on which animal life depends very heavily for its existence 46 more than 2 million species of plant and animal life have been identified to date 47 and estimates of the actual number of existing species range from several million to well over 48 49 50 the number of individual species of life is constantly in some degree of flux with new species appearing and others ceasing to exist on a continual basis 51 52 the total number of species is in rapid decline 53 54 55 evolution edit an area of the amazon rainforest shared between colombia and brazil the tropical rainforests of south america contain the largest diversity of species on earth 56 57 main article evolution the origin of life on earth is not well understood but it is known to have occurred at least years ago 58 59 60 during the hadean or archean eons on a primordial earth that had a substantially different environment than is found at present 61 these life forms possessed the basic traits of self replication and inheritable traits once life had appeared the process of evolution by natural selection resulted in the development of ever more diverse life forms species that were unable to adapt to the changing environment and competition from other life forms became extinct however the fossil record retains evidence of many of these older species current fossil and dna evidence shows that all existing species can trace a continual ancestry back to the first primitive life forms 61 the advent of photosynthesis in very basic forms of plant life worldwide allowed the energy to be harvested to create conditions allowing for more complex life citation needed the resultant oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere and gave rise to the ozone layer the incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of yet more complex cells called eukaryotes 62 cells within colonies became increasingly specialized resulting in true multicellular organisms with the ozone layer absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation life colonized the surface of earth microbes edit a microscopic mite lorryia formosa main article microbe the first form of life to develop on the earth were microbes and they remained the only form of life until about a billion years ago when multi cellular organisms began to appear 63 microorganisms are single celled organisms that are generally microscopic and smaller than the human eye can see they include bacteria fungi archaea and protista these life forms are found in almost every location on the earth where there is liquid water including in the interior 64 their reproduction is both rapid and profuse the combination of a high mutation rate and a horizontal gene transfer 65 ability makes them highly adaptable and able to survive in new environments including outer space 66 they form an essential part of the planetary ecosystem however some microorganisms are pathogenic and can post health risk to other organisms plants and animals edit main articles plant and animal a selection of diverse plant species a selection of diverse animal species originally aristotle divided all living things between plants which generally do not move fast enough for humans to notice and animals in linnaeus system these became the kingdoms vegetabilia later plantae and animalia since then it has become clear that the plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups and the fungi and several groups of algae were removed to new kingdoms however these are still often considered plants in many contexts bacterial life is sometimes included in flora 67 68 and some classifications use the term bacterial flora separately from plant flora among the many ways of classifying plants are by regional floras which depending on the purpose of study can also include fossil flora remnants of plant life from a previous era people in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic flora which can vary widely across the globe due to differences in climate and terrain regional floras commonly are divided into categories such as native flora and agricultural and garden flora the lastly mentioned of which are intentionally grown and cultivated some types of native flora actually have been introduced centuries ago by people migrating from one region or continent to another and become an integral part of the native or natural flora of the place to which they were introduced this is an example of how human interaction with nature can blur the boundary of what is considered nature another category of plant has historically been carved out for weeds though the term has fallen into disfavor among botanists as a formal way to categorize useless plants the informal use of the word weeds to describe those plants that are deemed worthy of elimination is illustrative of the general tendency of people and societies to seek to alter or shape the course of nature similarly animals are often categorized in ways such as domestic farm animals wild animals pests etc according to their relationship to human life animals as a category have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things animals are eukaryotic and usually multicellular although see myxozoa which separates them from bacteria archaea and most protists they are heterotrophic generally digesting food in an internal chamber which separates them from plants and algae they are also distinguished from plants algae and fungi by lacking cell walls with a few exceptions most notably the sponges phylum porifera citation needed animals have bodies differentiated into separate tissues 69 these include muscles which are able to contract and control locomotion and a nervous system which sends and processes signals there is also typically an internal digestive chamber the eukaryotic cells possessed by all animals are surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins this may be calcified to form structures like shells bones and spicules a framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized during development and maturation and which supports the complex anatomy required for mobility human interrelationship edit

secluded valleys along the na pali coast in hawaii are heavily modified by introduced invasive species such as she oak although humans comprise only a minuscule proportion of the total living biomass on earth the human effect on nature is disproportionately large because of the extent of human influence the boundaries between what humans regard as nature and made environments is not clear cut except at the extremes even at the extremes the amount of natural environment that is free of discernible human influence is diminishing at an increasingly rapid pace the development of technology by the human race has allowed the greater exploitation of natural resources and has helped to alleviate some of the risk from natural hazards in spite of this progress however the fate of human civilization remains closely linked to changes in the environment there exists a highly complex feedback loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood 70 man made threats to the natural environment include pollution deforestation and disasters such as oil spills humans have contributed to the extinction of many plants and animals humans employ nature for both leisure and economic activities the acquisition of natural resources for industrial use remains a sizable component of the economic system 71 72 some activities such as hunting and fishing are used for both sustenance and leisure often by different people agriculture was first adopted around the 9th millennium bce ranging from food production to energy nature influences economic wealth although early humans gathered uncultivated plant materials for food and employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing 73 most modern human use of plants is through agriculture the clearance of large tracts of land for crop growth has led to a significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands resulting in the loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion 74 aesthetics and beauty edit pinguicula grandiflora commonly known as a butterwort beauty in nature has historically been a prevalent theme in art and books filling large sections of libraries and bookstores that nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art photography poetry and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty reasons why this association exists and what the association consists of are studied by the branch of philosophy called aesthetics beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful the opinions are virtually endless 75 nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history an early tradition of landscape art began in china during the tang dynasty the tradition of representing nature as it is became one of the aims of chinese painting and was a significant influence in asian art although natural wonders are celebrated in the psalms and the book of job wilderness portrayals in art became more prevalent in the 1800s especially in the works of the romantic movement british artists john constable and j m w turner turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings before that paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings william wordsworth s poetry described the wonder of the natural world which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of western culture 76 this artistic movement also coincided with the transcendentalist movement in the western world a common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word mimesis the imitation of nature also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the perfect is implied through perfect mathematical forms and more generally by patterns in nature as david rothenburg writes the beautiful is the root of science and the goal of art the highest possibility that humanity can ever hope to see 77 281 matter and energy edit the first few hydrogen atom electron orbitals

understand for this reason the most fundamental science is generally understood to be physics the name for which is still recognizable as meaning that it is the study of nature matter is commonly defined as the substance of which physical objects are composed it constitutes the observable universe the visible components of the universe are now believed to compose only 4.9 percent of the total mass the remainder is believed to consist of 26.8 percent cold dark matter and 68.3 percent dark energy 78 the exact arrangement of these components is still unknown and is under intensive investigation by physicists the behavior of matter and energy throughout the observable universe appears to follow well defined physical laws these laws have been employed to produce cosmological models that successfully explain the structure and the evolution of the universe we can observe the mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty physical constants 79 that appear to be static across the observable universe 80 the values of these constants have been carefully measured but the reason for their specific values remains a mystery beyond earth edit planets of

as material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft some of this debris re enters the atmosphere periodically although the earth is the only body within the solar system known to support life evidence suggests that in the distant past the planet mars possessed bodies of liquid water on the surface 81 for a brief period in mars history it may have also been capable of forming life at present though most of the water remaining on mars is frozen if life exists at all on mars it is most likely to be located underground where liquid water can still exist 82 conditions on the other terrestrial planets mercury and venus appear to be too harsh to support life as we know it but it has been conjectured that europa the fourth largest moon of jupiter may possess a sub surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life 83 astronomers have started to discover extrasolar earth analogs planets that lie in the habitable zone of space
