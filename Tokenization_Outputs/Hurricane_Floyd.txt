1999 atlantic hurricane season hurricane floyd was a very powerful cape verde type hurricane which struck the east coast of the united states it was the sixth named storm fourth hurricane and third major hurricane in the 1999 atlantic hurricane season floyd triggered the fourth largest evacuation in us history behind hurricane irma hurricane gustav and hurricane rita when coastal residents of five states were ordered from their homes as it approached the cape verde type hurricane formed off the coast of africa and lasted from september 7 to september 19 peaking in strength as a very strong short of the highest possible rating on the hurricane scale it was among the largest atlantic hurricanes of its strength ever recorded floyd was once forecast to strike florida but turned away instead floyd struck the bahamas at peak strength causing heavy damage it then paralleled the east coast of the united states causing massive evacuations and costly preparations from florida through the mid atlantic states the storm weakened significantly however before striking the cape fear region north carolina as a very strong hurricane and caused further damage as it traveled up the mid atlantic region and into new england the hurricane produced torrential rainfall in eastern north carolina adding more rain to an area hit by hurricane dennis just weeks earlier the rains caused widespread flooding over a period of several weeks nearly every river basin in the eastern part of the state exceeded 500 year flood levels in total floyd was responsible for 57 fatalities and 1999 usd in damage

references 8 external links meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the scale floyd originated as a tropical wave that exited the coast of africa on september 2 it moved steadily westward and remained disorganized and devoid of deep convection until september 7 when a curved band of deep convection developed over the center in response to a developing anticyclone at this point the national hurricane center designated it as tropical depression eight while it was approximately east of the lesser antilles a strong ridge of high pressure to its north forced the developing tropical cyclone westward over warmer waters allowing it to strengthen to tropical storm floyd on september 8 1 although a large storm floyd initially lacked a well defined inner core resulting in slow strengthening and preventing rapid intensification on september 10 it organized enough to reach hurricane status and floyd approached major hurricane strength on september 11 while north of the leeward islands the central atlantic upper tropospheric trough along with an upper level low in the eastern caribbean sea produced vertical wind shear over the hurricane and caused its winds to weaken to a turn to the west caused by building of high pressures was followed by a period of rapid intensification in maximum sustained winds increased from 110 to 177 to nb 1 while the pressure dropped to 921 mb 921 hpa 27.2 inhg by morning on september 13 the third lowest pressure for a hurricane not to reach intensity in the atlantic ocean hurricane opal and hurricane gloria had lower pressures than floyd 2 one contributor to the intensification was the high oceanic heat content along the path 1 hurricane floyd remained just below status on the hurricane scale for while crossing the bahamas making landfalls on eleuthera and abaco islands 1 before an eyewall replacement cycle weakened it to a hurricane with winds of the new larger eyewall contracted slightly and the hurricane briefly re intensified to status a strong mid to upper level trough eroded the western portion of the high pressure ridge steering floyd to the northwest it paralleled the eastern florida coast 110 miles off shore and steadily weakened because of entrainment of dry air and upper level shear 1 the storm remained extremely large however at its peak tropical storm force winds spanned a diameter of making floyd one of the largest atlantic hurricanes of its intensity ever recorded 3 floyd accelerated to the north and northeast and weakened greatly to a hurricane it made landfall in cape fear north carolina with winds of on september 16 after crossing over north carolina and southeastern virginia it briefly re entered the western atlantic ocean before making a second landfall on jones beach long island on september 17 the storm gradually lost its tropical characteristics due to an approaching frontal zone and became extratropical over southern maine late on september 17 the extratropical storm continued to the northeast and after passing over the canadian maritimes it was absorbed by a cold front to the east of newfoundland 1 preparations edit although track prediction was above average while out at sea the forecasts as it approached the coastline were merely average compared to forecasts from the previous ten years the official forecasts did not predict northward track nor its significant weakening before landfall 4 nearly all of the east coast from florida city florida to plymouth massachusetts was under a hurricane warning at some point however only a fraction of this area actually received hurricane force winds the last time such widespread hurricane warnings occurred was during hurricane donna in 1960 although the warnings for that storm were accurate 1 visual comparison of hurricane floyd with hurricane andrew while at similar positions and nearly identical intensities initial fears were of a direct hit as a large hurricane in florida potentially costlier and deadlier than hurricane andrew had been in 1992 in preparation for a potentially catastrophic landfall more than one million florida residents were told to evacuate of which 272,000 were in miami dade county 5 u s president bill clinton declared a federal state of emergency in both florida and georgia in anticipation of the approach 6 as the storm turned to the north more people were evacuated as a progressively larger area was threatened the massive storm caused what was at the time the largest peacetime evacuation ever in the u s with around evacuating coastal areas in florida georgia and the carolinas 7 evacuation on interstate 26 with the storm predicted to hit near cape canaveral with winds of over all but 80 of kennedy space center s 12 500 person workforce were evacuated the hangars that house three space shuttles can withstand winds of only and a direct hit could have resulted in potentially billions of dollars in damage of space equipment 8 in the theoretical scenario the damage would be caused by water always a potential problem in an area only nine feet above sea level if water entered the facility it would damage the electronics as well as requiring a complete inspection of all hardware 9 when floyd actually passed by the area kennedy space center only reported light winds with minor water intrusion damage was minor overall and was repaired easily 10 a hurricane warning was issued for the north carolina coastline prior to landfall however due to the size of the storm initial forecasts predicted nearly all of the state would be affected in one form or another school systems and businesses as far west as asheville shut down for the day landfall was predicted but as it turned out only the coastal plain sustained significant damage much of the state west of raleigh escaped unscathed in new york city public schools were closed on september 16 1999 the day floyd hit the area this was a rare decision by the city as new york city public schools close on average once every few years before floyd the last time new york city closed its schools was for the blizzard of 1996 after floyd the next time its public schools would close was due to a blizzard on march 5 2001 11 walt disney world also closed for the first time in its history due to the storm impact edit death toll by area state country deaths the bahamas 1 north carolina 51 virginia 3 delaware 2 pennsylvania 6 new jersey 6 new york 2 connecticut 1 vermont 1 maine 1 total 74 with a death toll of 65 hurricane floyd was the deadliest united states hurricane since hurricane agnes in 1972 the storm also was one of the costliest in the history amounting to most of the deaths and damage were from inland freshwater flooding in eastern north carolina bahamas edit hurricane floyd lashed the bahamas with winds of and waves up to in height 7 a storm surge inundated many islands with over five ft of water throughout 12 the wind and waves toppled power and communication lines severely disrupting electricity and telephone services for days damage was greatest at abaco island cat island san salvador island and eleuthera island where floyd uprooted trees and destroyed a significant number of houses 13 numerous restaurants hotels shops and homes were devastated severely limiting in the recovery period tourism on which many rely for economic well being 14 damaged water systems left tens of thousands across the archipelago without water electricity or food despite the damage however few deaths were reported as only one person drowned in freeport and there were few injuries reported 12 to help the affected citizens the bahamas red cross society opened 41 shelters though within one week many returned home 15 the bahamas required $435,000 in aid following the storm much of it in food parcels 12 the inter american development bank loaned to the archipelago to restore bridges roads seawalls docks and other building projects in the aftermath of the hurricane 16 southeastern united states edit although over a million florida residents were evacuated the state was only lightly affected by hurricane floyd strong waves and tropical storm force winds resulted in significant beach erosion on the east coast of florida as well as the loss of some boat piers in brevard and volusia counties moderate rainfall occurred along the coastline amounting to a maximum of in sanford winds downed hundreds of trees damaging 357 houses damage in northeast florida amounted to a fraction of what was originally expected 1 the states of georgia and south carolina although threatened by the storm were largely spared when it turned northward some areas of eastern south carolina reported up to of rain 1 north carolina edit hurricane floyd making landfall in cape fear north carolina on september 16 coastal property damage at pine knoll shores north carolina north carolina received the brunt of the destruction in all hurricane floyd caused 51 fatalities in north carolina much of them from freshwater flooding as well as billions in damage radar imagery of hurricane floyd making landfall in north carolina the storm surge from the large hurricane amounted to along the southeastern portion of the state the hurricane also spawned numerous tornadoes most of which caused only minor damage damage to power lines left over 500,000 customers without electricity at some point during the passage 1 just weeks prior to floyd hitting hurricane dennis brought up to of rain to southeastern north carolina when hurricane floyd moved across the state in early september it produced torrential rainfall amounting to a maximum of in wilmington though it moved quickly the extreme rainfall was due to interaction with an approaching cold front across the area 1 extensive flooding especially along nc hwy 91 and the white oak loop neighborhood led to overflowing rivers nearly every river basin in eastern north carolina reached or greater flood levels 17 most localized flooding happened overnight floyd dropped nearly of rain during the hours of its passage and many residents were not aware of the flooding until the water came into their homes the national guard and the coast guard performed nearly 1700 fresh water rescues of people trapped on the roofs of their homes due to the rapid rise of the water by contrast many of the worst affected areas did not reach peak flood levels for several weeks after the storm as the water accumulated in rivers and moved downstream see flood graphic at right the passage of hurricane irene four weeks later contributed an additional six in of rain over the still saturated area causing further flooding flooded areas from floyd along the tar and neuse rivers as of september 17 as of september 23 as of september 30 the tar river suffered the worst flooding exceeding 500 year flood levels along its lower stretches it crested above flood stage flooding began in rocky mount as much as 30% of which was underwater for several days in tarboro much of the downtown was under several feet of water 18 nearby the town of princeville was largely destroyed when the waters of the tar poured over the levee covering the town with over of floodwater for ten days 19 further downstream greenville suffered very heavy flooding damages in pitt county alone were estimated at 7 washington where the peak flood level was observed was likewise devastated some residents in greenville had to swim six feet underwater to reach the front doors of their homes and apartments 20 due to the heavy flooding in downtown greenville the east carolina pirates were forced to relocate their football game against 9 miami to n c state s stadium in raleigh where they beat the hurricanes 27-23 21 the neuse river roanoke river waccamaw river and new river exceeded 500 year flood levels although damage was lower in these areas compared to the tar river because of lower population densities because most of the cape fear river basin was west of the peak rainfall areas the city of wilmington was spared the worst flooding despite having the highest localized rainfall however the northeast cape fear river a tributary did exceed 500 year flood levels of the eastern rivers only the lumber river escaped catastrophic flooding 17 rainfall and strong winds affected many homes across the state destroying 7,000 leaving 17,000 uninhabitable and damaging 56,000 ten thousand people resided in temporary shelters following the storm the extensive flooding resulted in significant crop damage as quoted by north carolina secretary of health and human services h david bruton nothing since the civil war has been as destructive to families here the recovery process will be much longer than the water going down process 7 around 31,000 jobs were lost from over 60,000 businesses through the storm causing nearly in lost business revenue 22 in much of the affected area officials urged people to either boil water or buy bottled water during aftermath 23 in contrast to the problems eastern north carolina experienced much of the western portion of the state remained under a severe drought 7 virginia edit flooding in franklin virginia as in north carolina floyd produced torrential rainfall in the most eastern portions of virginia amounting to a peak of in newport news 1 the rainfall led to overflowing rivers in the chowan river basin some of which exceeded 500 year flood levels 17 the blackwater river reached 100 year flood levels and flooded franklin with of water extensive road damage occurred there isolating the area from the rest of the state some 182 businesses and 150 houses were underwater in franklin from the worst flooding in in addition two dams along the rappahannock river burst from the extreme flooding throughout all of virginia floyd damaged 9,250 houses killed and caused in damage 24 mid atlantic edit main articles effects of hurricane floyd in new york and effects of hurricane floyd in pennsylvania rainfall from floyd in the united states by the time floyd hit the shore it was significantly weaker than it was at sea due to the collapsing of its concentric eyes this had little effect on the inland damage caused by the storm however and floyd produced torrential rains and high winds throughout the mid atlantic as far north as new york city and long island 1 chestertown maryland reported a maximum rainfall total of with other locales reporting similar values 1 extreme river flooding caused moderate damage to bridges and roads resulting in a damage toll of throughout the state 25 in addition over 250,000 residents were without electricity because of high winds blowing down power lines 7 rainfall amounts peaked at in somerville new jersey and in vernon delaware the raritan river basin experienced record flooding as a result of heavy rains higher than the previous record flood crest 26 bound brook new jersey and neighboring south bound brook were especially hard hit by a record flooding event a 42 foot flood crest 27 above flood stage sent of water on main street and drowned three people 26 28 manville new jersey was hit nearly as hard with record breaking floods coming from the raritan river and the nearby millstone river which join in manville flooding was also exacerbated by the delaware raritan canal a section of which runs parallel to the millstone river and for a stretch are only separated by several feet a path princeton university in princeton nj for several days declared municipal tap water unsafe to drink advised students in dorms not to shower and provided bottled drinking water the rochelle park new jersey hub of electronic data systems was inundated by the nearby saddle river disrupting service to as many as 8,000 atms across the united states 29 flooding in an adjoining bell atlantic switching facility cut off phone service to one million customers in the area 30 rain affecting the mid atlantic still a large tropical cyclone when it hit the mid atlantic states floyd produced a strong storm surge peaking at with a storm tide of in philadelphia with effects felt in parts of northern pennsylvania including the wilkes barre scranton metro area some 1,260,000 citizens across the three states lost power because of the storm and flooding left many in pennsylvania homeless in new york over of rain triggered mudslides on the bluffs overlooking the hudson river near the tappan zee bridge 7 new england edit main article effects of hurricane floyd in new england floyd caused large power outages and flood damage across new england with over five inches of rain being dropped over most of the area danbury connecticut received up to 15 inches of rain from the storm resulting in extensive flooding in the city and surrounding areas mudslides were reported in the berkshire mountains of western massachusetts several major highways and a countless number of local roads in connecticut and massachusetts were closed for several days due to flooding mudslides and downed trees and power lines because new england had been in a severe drought leading up to floyd the floodwaters quickly receded 7 east of center large trees were uprooted by the winds causing widespread power outages and minor structural damage 31 canada edit the remnants of floyd continued into canada entering the canadian hurricane centre s area of responsibility on the evening and regional offices in quebec and atlantic canada on september 16 floyd became an extratropical low pressure system gradually losing strength and accelerating in the upper flow in general winds were below 90 kilometres per hour over canada however near quebec city quebec province the weather station on recorded gusts up to 119 kilometres per hour 32 33 and in the maritimes 34 damages to corn and other crops were recorded on the south shore of the saint lawrence river from the to bellechasse regions according to the des assurances agricoles du 35 in the maritime provinces waves reached 9 metres equivalent of those caused by a winter storm 34 rain fall was still substantial with up to 120 millimetres over eastern townships and beauce regions of quebec and the central part of new brunswick 36 37 region along the st lawrence river between montreal and peninsula and newfoundland received from 50 to 80 millimetres 38 rain caused some damages to crops 35 aftermath edit criticism of fema edit flooding in greenville north carolina on the tar river the hurricane floyd disaster was followed by what many judged to be a very slow federal response fully three weeks after the storm hit jesse jackson complained to fema director james lee witt on his cnn program both sides now it seemed there was preparation for hurricane floyd but then came flood floyd bridges are overwhelmed levees are overwhelmed whole towns under water an awesome scene of tragedy so a great misery index in north carolina witt responded starting to move the camper trailers in been so wet been difficult to get things in there but now going to be moving very quickly and i think going to see think the people there will see a big difference within this next weekend 39 ecological effects edit runoff in the aftermath of the hurricane runoff from the hurricane created significant problems for the ecology of north rivers and sounds in the immediate aftermath of the storm freshwater runoff sediment and decomposing organic matter caused salinity and oxygen levels in pamlico sound and its tributary rivers to drop to nearly zero this raised fears of massive fish and shrimp kills as had happened after hurricane fran and hurricane bonnie and the state government responded quickly to provide financial aid to fishing and shrimping industries strangely however the shrimp and crab harvests were extremely prosperous one possible explanation is that runoff from hurricane dennis caused marine animals to begin migrating to saltier waters so they were less vulnerable to ill effects 3 pollution from runoff was also a significant fear numerous pesticides were found in low but measurable quantities in the river waters particularly in the neuse river overall however the concentration of contaminants was slightly lower than had been measured in hurricane fran likely because floyd simply dropped more water to dilute them 17 hog waste water contamination edit when the hurricane hit north carolina it flooded hog waste lagoons and released 25 million gallons of manure into the rivers which contaminated the water supply and reduced water quality 40 ronnie kennedy duplin county director for environmental health said that of 310 private wells he had tested for contamination since the storm 9 percent or three times the average across eastern north carolina had faecal coliform bacteria normally tests showing any hint of faeces in drinking water an indication that it can be carrying disease causing pathogens are cause for immediate action 41 retirement edit see also list of retired atlantic hurricane names because of the destruction in north carolina and elsewhere in the united
