atlantic canada part of the 1979 atlantic hurricane season hurricane frederic was an intense and damaging tropical cyclone that carved a path of damage from the lesser antilles to quebec in particular devastating areas of the united states gulf coast though only five were killed directly the us in damage accrued by frederic made it the atlantic basin s costliest tropical cyclone on record at the time prior to its final landfall the threat that frederic imposed on areas of the u s gulf coast triggered a mass exodus from the region larger than any other evacuation in the past while the storm primarily impacted the u s states of mississippi and alabama lesser effects were felt throughout the greater and lesser antilles as well as inland north america frederic developed from a tropical depression south of the cape verde islands on 1979 nb 1 tracking at a steady clip westward the primitive cyclone reached tropical storm intensity the next day favorable conditions in the open atlantic allowed for frederic to reach hurricane intensity on however outflow from nearby hurricane david began to inhibit further intensification and would continue to do so for roughly a week weakening frederic as it tracked across the greater antilles the tropical cyclone nearly dissipated over cuba before redeveloping on near the isle of youth from then on frederic moved northwestward intensifying to its peak intensity in the gulf of mexico with winds of on shortly before making landfall at dauphin island alabama just below the state line between alabama and mississippi over the united states frederic weakened for a final time before becoming extratropical in pennsylvania on and dissipating the next day damage estimates vary from 2008 usd with variations due to inadequate reporting of private insurance claims as well as lack of hard data on uninsured damage fema which had been established only three months before frederic hit was the focal point for nearly in federal aid for

to the scale the precursor to hurricane frederic emerged as a loosely defined tropical wave off the west coast of africa late on the following day satellite images indicated that the tropical wave had become more defined and was beginning to show signs of cyclonic rotation at 0600 utc on the national hurricane center nhc classified the system as a tropical depression based on observational data from ships nearby in conjunction with satellite images 1 2 upon developing into a tropical cyclone the depression moved at an unusually rapid pace westward gradually curving towards the west northwest and slowly intensifying in ideal conditions at on 2 the tropical depression was upgraded to tropical storm status and thus named frederic 1 intensification continued after the upgrade and early on frederic developed an eye prompting the nhc to further upgrade the tropical cyclone to hurricane status at that day 1 2 frederic only maintained hurricane intensity for roughly eighteen hours over the open waters of the atlantic on before outflow from nearby hurricane david began to adversely affect the tropical cyclone 1 2 at on frederic weakened back to tropical storm strength while it was still well east of the lesser antilles this weakening phase continued as frederic began to assume a more westerly track and slow in forward motion 1 on frederic tracked over the virgin islands before making landfall on puerto rico later that day with maximum sustained winds of 2 interaction with puerto rico greatly disrupted the low level circulation contained within the tropical cyclone enhancing the weakening effects of hurricane outflow after passing over the island the tropical storm briefly took a southwest course before curving into hispaniola on inducing additional disruption within frederic at that day frederic was downgraded to tropical depression status north of haiti 1 frederic remained a tropical depression for two days as it tracked into and then parallel to the southern coast of cuba beginning on 2 during this time hurricane david had tracked far into the northeastern united states and as a result its inhibiting effects of intensification ceased 1 at on 2 frederic regained tropical storm intensity while located roughly east of the isle of youth the following day the cyclone tracked over western cuba as it gradually curved towards the northwest 2 favorable conditions marked by very warm sea surface temperatures as high as and the presence of a large anticyclone over the system allowed frederic to strengthen to hurricane status for a second time while just northwest of cuba despite proximity to land 1 frederic took a northwesterly course throughout its trek across the gulf of mexico in early september intensifying in a highly conducive environment 1 by on the hurricane became stronger than it had ever been over the central atlantic at on frederic attained major hurricane status over the eastern gulf of mexico and twelve hours later reached peak intensity with a minimum barometric pressure of 943 mbar hpa 27.85 inhg and sustained winds of nb 2 making the cyclone a hurricane on the hurricane wind scale 2 moving gradually faster in the gulf of mexico 1 frederic eventually made two one on dauphin island and the other near the border between alabama and mississippi with a virtually unchanged intensity 2 4 tracking rapidly northward frederic began to weaken due to land interaction and was downgraded to tropical storm status while it was near meridian mississippi on 1 at around the same time the cyclone began to curve northeastward 2 eventually merging with an extratropical cyclone in southwestern pennsylvania by on these extratropical remnants proceeded to track through the mid atlantic states and new england before they were last officially documented by the nhc in new brunswick on 1 2 however the canadian hurricane centre still considered the cyclone active up until the storm entered the labrador sea on 5 preparations edit evacuation out of the mobile area the first tropical cyclone watches and warnings issued in association with frederic were on when the national hurricane center issued a hurricane warning and gale warning for several islands of the lesser antilles stretching from dominica to the northern leeward islands 6 residents of charlotte amalie in the united states virgin islands were urged by governor juan francisco luis to move to shelters 7 luis also mobilized a company of the virgin islands national guard to expedite evacuations and protect emptied residences and other buildings from looting 8 further south in dominica melville hall airport was forced to close due to the precense of gale force winds delaying relief efforts following hurricane david 9 despite having weakened to a tropical storm by the time frederic moved over the virgin islands the national hurricane center issued a hurricane watch for puerto rico on 10 as precautionary measures the luis international airport and schools closed for the duration of the storm 8 hundreds of residents were ordered to evacuate from toa baja for the second time in just four days due to the threat of flooding rivers 11 in trujillo alto a dike was relieved in order to mitigate potential flooding 12 after its track across puerto rico gale warnings were issued for portions of the dominican republic and haiti as well as the turks and caicos islands 13 no watches or warnings were issued by the nhc for any areas while frederic was classified as a tropical depression over the greater antilles 14 however small craft warnings were posted for some coastal regions off of miami florida due to strong winds caused by the nearby tropical cyclone 15 after frederic reattained hurricane status in the gulf of mexico on a gale warning were issued for the dry tortugas this was the first nhc warning issued in association with the newly developed tropical cyclone 2 14 not long after a hurricane watch was issued for coastal areas extending from panama city florida to vermilion bay in louisiana 14 although forecasts showed that frederic posed no threat to sarasota florida the city readied barrels of water if distribution was necessitated to sarasota county s shelters municipality managers were asked to place their respective emergency personnel on standby 16 in key west florida city workers had shortened workdays while the storm moved close by 17 up to 500,000 were evacuated from the u s gulf coast in anticipation of arrival citation needed impact edit lesser antilles and puerto rico edit effects from frederic were first felt on the outward facing leeward islands in antigua the threat of widespread power outages forced the insular government to shut down power 18 10 a peak gust of was documented on the island as a result of the storm 1 these strong winds also unroofed some buildings 8 strong winds and rain were felt in guadeloupe barbuda and a number of other islands but no damaging effects from the passing tropical cyclone occurred in those locations 18 power outages knocked out electricity to half of tortola in the british virgin islands and downed telephone lines rainfall and downed trees blocked several roads 19 offshore the yacht princess blew out into sea prompting a coast guard rescue of the ship and its crew 8 as a tropical storm 2 frederic dropped heavy rain across the u s virgin islands and puerto rico despite having weakened from its prior hurricane intensity the storm still brought gale force winds coupled with gusts as strong as to the area 1 three apartments in the same apartment complex on st thomas were unroofed displacing roughly 20 electricity was deliberately cut during the late night hours to prevent the spread of power outages 12 in st maarten these strong winds toppled a radio antenna 7 the entirety of the u s virgin islands reported numerous felled trees and downed utility lines as a result of the strong winds wind damage on nearby puerto rico was of only minor extent and much less severe than in the virgin islands 20 however torrential precipitation accounted for most of the damage as the passage of hurricane david less than a week earlier saturated soils priming the area for floods induced by the passage of frederic rainfall peaked at around in in puerto rico and in in st croix 1 21 rainfall totals in puerto rico and the u s virgin islands all rivers in southeastern puerto rico swelled and produce significant flooding in adjacent floodplains the discharge of the rio santiago near naguabo reached 100 year levels these floods partially inundated several cities submerged crops and damaged numerous roads major arterial roads to and from ponce were blocked by floodwater and landslide debris some portions of puerto rico were submerged by water from both the torrential rain and wave action damage from frederic in puerto rico reached at least though western puerto rico sustained minimal damage from the storm in st thomas four small homes were destroyed by flooding and an additional fifty sustained at least partial damage one waterspout was reported off the coast but did no damage normally dry coastal guts in st croix filled with floodwater from frederic damaging homes and other buildings in five communities on st croix culverts bridges and heavy beach erosion resulted from rough surf off the coast of the island the floods generated various sewage problems 20 flowing floodwaters washed away plentiful food crops in st maarten 8 some homes were damaged and others destroyed on the adjacent sint maarten 11 off of the island seven people were killed after their fishing boat sank during the storm 1 damage in virgin islands also reached at least similar to puerto rico 20 hispaniola and cuba edit heavy rains buffeted the islands of hispaniola and cuba for several days as frederic albeit disorganized 22 tracked over the greater antilles as with puerto rico and the lesser antilles precipitation damage was exacerbated by the recent passage of hurricane david in on eastern atlantic coast at least of rainfall was reported frederic continued to produce strong winds even as a weak tropical depression south of cuba as sustained winds of were clocked in santa cruz del sur on however damage from frederic in hispaniola and eastern cuba remained minimal 1 landfall on western cuba as a redeveloped tropical cyclone was much more significant than its first cuban landfall sustained winds peaked at in honda cuba on 1 despite recent renovations at international airport the lack of a proper drainage system allowed rainfall to inundate the airport stranding several heads of state that were scheduled to hold a summit and disrupting air traffic to and from the airport for an entire week 23 heavy precipitation triggered numerous landslides causing severe damage to infrastructure and over areas at risk for additional landslide activity were declared inhospitable resulting in the evacuation of 24 rainfall estimates in cuba peaked at 25 a lack of damage reports was evident from western cuba following landfall though damage estimates were high 1 united states edit the dauphin island bridge was destroyed by hurricane frederic making it only reachable by boat storm surge damage was reported along of coastline from mississippi to florida with tides 8 to 2.4-3.7 m above the normal level being observed five deaths were directly attributed to frederic in the united states four of which occurred inland a person swept from a boat near pensacola was the only casualty along the coast 1 in total frederic was responsible for 1979 usd billion 2015 usd in damages this made frederic the costliest hurricane in the history of the united states at the time the figure was not surpassed until hurricane hugo in 1989 26 frederic also dumped heavy rainfall across much of the eastern united states over a dozen tornadoes were also reported in wake however these had minimal impact 27 florida edit as frederic was strengthening in the gulf of mexico strong winds were reported in the florida keys a station on the dry tortugas recorded a wind gust on this was stronger than any other florida wind gust measurement in association with frederic a station in key west florida clocked at wind gust coupled with sustained winds of 1 tides in the dry tortugas peaked at roughly above normal 16 28 rainfall from the extremities of the hurricane reached south florida 29 with some rainfall totals exceeding 21 alabama edit frederic made landfall at dauphin island alabama and continued across to a point on the alabama mississippi state line near bayou la batre alabama 30 near total property damage occurred along the alabama coastline between fort morgan and gulf shores the latter seeing 80% of its buildings completely destroyed the causeway linking dauphin island to the mainland was swept away in many areas 26 second largest city mobile alabama suffered extensive damage as well wind damage was also severe especially across southern alabama hurricane force gusts were felt as far inland as choctaw county structural failure was widespread in the immediate landfall area with industrial residential and governmental buildings as well as hospitals suffering heavy damage nearly 90% of the mobile area lost electricity and the historic city hall experienced heavy roof damage many small beach houses were completely destroyed by high winds before the storm surge could add any effects 26 31 tree damage with broken limbs was extensive leaving thousands of tall pine trees all tilted leaning in the direction the wind had come 11 alabama counties were declared disaster areas mississippi edit 8 to of rain fell in jackson county mississippi around biloxi and pascagoula 16 mississippi counties were declared disaster areas the most in the united states hurricane force winds were felt as far northward as meridian mississippi 32 canada edit frederic dropped heavy rain across canada as an extratropical storm peaking at near ottawa ontario record precipitation was recorded at the j s marshall radar observatory in sainte anne de bellevue quebec which documented of rain on rainfall spread as far northeast as the eastern coast of labrador flooding occurred in eastern ontario and portions of the niagara peninsula as noted in cornwall in toronto the rains led to a seven car traffic collision and a separate car accident that injured two flooding also took place in southern quebec with floodwater submerging streets basements and underground parking lots in montreal damage from southern quebec reached c 5 aftermath edit damage after hurricane frederic in gulf shores alabama eleven counties in alabama sixteen in mississippi and five in florida were declared eligible for disaster aid in retrospect frederic has been credited with spurring redevelopment in mobile and the surrounding gulf coast region for example in testimony before congress in 1992 robert sheets then the director of the national hurricane center described the economic aftermath of frederic prior to hurricane frederic there was one condominium complex on gulf shores alabama most of the homes were single individual homes built behind the sand dunes today where there used to be one condominium there are now at least 104 not units on gulf shores alabama retirement edit see also list of retired
