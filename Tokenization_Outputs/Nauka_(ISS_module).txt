nauka iss module wikipedia nauka iss module from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search this article is about the iss component for the academic publisher see nauka publisher rendering of the nauka module docked to zvezda nauka russian lit science also known as the multipurpose laboratory module mlm russian or is a component of the international space station iss which has not yet been launched into space the mlm is funded by the roscosmos state corporation in the original iss plans nauka was to use the location of the docking and stowage module later the dsm was moved to zarya s nadir port and named rassvet planners anticipate nauka will dock at zvezda s nadir port replacing pirs the launch of nauka initially planned for 2007 has been repeatedly delayed during 2013 the launch was rescheduled to april 2014 and then to june 2014 nasa documents at that time indicated that the module would not fly before november 2015 1 2 3 in april 2014 it emerged that the target date for launch was postponed to february 2017 as it became necessary to manufacture a new propulsion system for the module 1 as of november 2016 update the tentative launch date has slipped to mid 2018 4 aboard a proton m rocket contents 1 original plans for nauka 2 work on nauka and launch date 3 usage 3.1 primary research module 4 specifications 5 see also 6 references 7 external links original plans for nauka edit in the 1990s plans for the russian segment of the iss included several research modules that were intended to be adjunct to zarya and zvezda in these earlier plans the now cancelled complex of the universal docking module udm and the two newly developed russian research modules were to be attached zvezda s nadir port the udm was to be based on the functional cargo block fgb 2 the fgb 2 was originally built as a backup for the original launch of the zarya fgb module construction had been halted at 70 percent completeness in the late 1990s however the plans changed in the early 2000s in august 2004 it was decided to build the nauka iss module based on the fgb 2 5 during that time there was an alternate rejected proposal for nauka from rkk energia based on the cancelled commercial enterprise module entertainment and studio module which was to be jointly funded by rkk energia and spacehab 6 work on nauka and launch date edit nauka training mockup at the gagarin cosmonaut training center in april 2012 at the end of 2005 the european space agency esa agreed with the russians that the european robotic arm would be launched together with nauka mated on its surface for a later deployment in space a spare elbow joint for the european robotic arm was already launched together with rassvet in 2004 the russian federal space agency stated that nauka should be ready for launch in 2007 on a russian proton rocket however the nauka project was delayed further first to 2008 and later to 2009 a november 2006 esa bulletin mentioned that the rsa was negotiating with the iss partners to push back the prospective launch date to the end of 2008 in october 2011 it was reported that nauka was expected to be launched at the end of 2013 7 in may 2012 it was reported that the launch date had been pushed back to 2014 8 the next planned launch date was april 2014 according to vitaly lopota president of rsc energia 2 on october 25 2013 parabolic arc reported that nauka was flawed and had failed acceptance testing at rkk energia 3 found problems in the propulsion system included a leaking fueling valve that needed to be replaced and contamination which would require a lengthy cleaning 1 the module was to be returned to khrunichev for repairs which would take another 12 to 18 months 3 on november 27 2013 it was reported that the russian space agency had informed nasa that the launch had been postponed until at least 2015 9 in april 2014 it emerged that the target date for launch was postponed to february 2017 a new propulsion system needed to be manufactured as the installed had exceeded its warranty 1 usage edit nauka will initially be used for experiments docking and cargo it will also serve as a crew work and rest area nauka will be equipped with full guidance and navigation control including engines and an attitude control system that can be used as a backup by the iss it will be docked onto the zvezda nadir earth facing docking port outfitting equipment launched in 2010 with the rassvet mini research module 1 on nasa s sts 132 will also be used for nauka including the spare elbow joint for the european robotic arm internal hardware and an experimental airlock to be positioned on one of the side facing ports at the bottom of the module the new module will contain crew quarters with life support equipment including atmospheric processing galley and toilet 7 primary research module edit nauka will be primary iss research module for some time official plans included a second research module around the same size as nauka listed to be under review but it was eventually cancelled leaving nauka to be the only russian research module besides rassvet and poisk mini research module 2 specifications edit length 13
