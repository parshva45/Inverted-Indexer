tropical cyclones portal v t e a tropical cyclone rainfall climatology is developed to determine rain storm size and degree of vertical wind shear one of the most significant threats from tropical cyclones is heavy rainfall large slow moving and non sheared tropical cyclones produce the heaviest rains the intensity of a tropical cyclone appears to have little bearing on its potential for rainfall over land but satellite measurements over the last several years show that more intense tropical cyclones produce noticeably more rainfall over water flooding from tropical cyclones remains a

inland flooding is common to tropical cyclones there are factors which lead to excessive rainfall from tropical cyclones slow motion as was seen during hurricane danny 1997 and hurricane wilma can lead to high amounts of rainfall the presence of mountains hills near the coast like across much of mexico haiti the dominican republic central america madagascar china and japan acts to magnify rainfall potential due to forced upslope flow into the mountains strong upper level forcing from a trough moving through the westerlies and its associated cold front as was the case during hurricane floyd can lead to high amounts even from systems moving at an average forward motion larger tropical cyclones drop more rainfall as they precipitate upon one spot for a longer time frame than average or small tropical cyclones a combination of two of these factors could be especially crippling as was seen during hurricane mitch in central america 1 during the 2005 season flooding related to slow moving hurricane stan s broad circulation led to deaths 2 general distribution within a tropical cyclone edit rainfall rate per day within radius of the center riehl radius mi radius km amount in

larger proportion of rainfall falls in advance of the center or eye than after the passage with the highest percentage falling in the right front quadrant father of cuba found that some tropical cyclones have their highest rainfall rates in the rear quadrant within a training non moving inflow band 3 normally as a tropical cyclone intensifies its heavier rainfall rates become more concentrated around its center 4 rainfall is found to be heaviest in tropical inner core whether it be the eyewall or central dense overcast within a degree latitude of the center with lesser amounts farther away from the center 5 most of the rainfall in tropical cyclones is concentrated within its radius of gale force winds 6 rainfall is more common near the center of tropical cyclones overnight over land outer bands are more active during the heating of the day which can act to restrict inflow into the center of the cyclone recent studies have shown that half of the rainfall within a tropical cyclone is stratiform in nature 7 the chart to the right was developed by riehl in 1954 using meteorological equations that assume a gale radius of about 140 miles a fairly symmetric cyclone and does not consider topographic effects or vertical wind shear local amounts can exceed this chart by a factor of two due to topography wind shear tends to lessen the amounts below what is shown on the table relation to storm size edit the relative sizes of typhoon tip cyclone tracy and the united states larger tropical cyclones have larger rain shields which can lead to higher rainfall amounts farther from the center 6 this is generally due to the longer time frame rainfall falls at any one spot in a larger system when compared to a smaller system some of the difference seen concerning rainfall between larger and small storms could be the increased sampling of rainfall within a larger tropical cyclone when compared to that of a compact cyclone in other words the difference could be the result of a statistical problem slow looping motion on rainfall magnitude edit storms which have moved slowly or loop over a succession of days lead to the highest rainfall amounts for several countries riehl calculated that of rainfall per day can be expected within one half degree or of the center of a mature tropical cyclone many tropical cyclones progress at a forward motion of which would limit the duration of this excessive rainfall to around one quarter of a day which would yield about of rainfall this would be true over water within of the coastline 8 and outside topographic features as a cyclone moves farther inland and is cut off from its supply of warmth and moisture the ocean rainfall amounts from tropical cyclones and their remains decrease quickly 9 vertical wind shear impact on rainfall shield edit vertical wind shear forces the rainfall pattern around a tropical cyclone to become highly asymmetric with most of the precipitation falling to the left and downwind of the shear vector or downshear left in other words southwesterly shear forces the bulk of the rainfall north northeast of the center 10 if the wind shear is strong enough the bulk of the rainfall will move away from the center leading to what is known as an exposed circulation center when this occurs the potential magnitude of rainfall with the tropical cyclone will be significantly reduced effect of interaction with frontal boundaries upper level troughs edit as a tropical cyclone interacts with an upper level trough and the related surface front a distinct northern area of precipitation is seen along the front ahead of the axis of the upper level trough this type of interaction can lead to the appearance of the heaviest rainfall falling along and to the left of the tropical cyclone track with the precipitation streaking hundreds of miles or kilometers downwind from the tropical cyclone 11 the stronger the upper trough picking up the tropical cyclone the more significant the left of track shift in the rainfall distribution tends to be 7 mountains edit moist air forced up the slopes of coastal hills and mountain chains can lead to much heavier rainfall than in the coastal plain this heavy rainfall can lead to landslides which still cause significant loss of life such as seen during hurricane mitch in central america global distribution edit global tropical cyclone rainfall in 2005 globally tropical cyclone rainfall is more common across the northern hemisphere than across the southern hemisphere this is mainly due to the normal annual tropical cyclone distribution as between half and two thirds of all tropical cyclones form north of the equator rainfall is concentrated near the 15th parallel in both hemispheres with a less steep dropoff seen with latitude across the northern hemisphere due to the stronger warm water currents seen in that hemisphere which allow tropical cyclones to remain tropical in nature at higher latitudes than south of the equator in the southern hemisphere rainfall impacts will be most common between january and march while north of the equator tropical cyclone rainfall impacts are more common between june and november 7 japan receives over half of its rainfall from typhoons 12 united states tropical cyclone rainfall statistics edit u s tropical cyclone rainfall accumulations per time frame see also united states tropical cyclone rainfall climatology between 1970-2004 inland flooding from tropical cyclones caused a majority of the fatalities in the united states 13 this statistic changed in 2005 when hurricane katrina s impact alone shifted the most deadly aspect of tropical cyclones back to storm surge which has historically been the most deadly aspect of strong tropical cyclones 14 on average five tropical cyclones of at least tropical depression strength lead to rainfall across the contiguous united states annually contributing around a quarter of the annual rainfall to the southeast united states while many of these storms form in the atlantic basin some systems or their remnants move through mexico from the eastern pacific basin the average storm total rainfall for a tropical cyclone impacting the lower 48 from the atlantic basin is about with percent of the storm total falling within a 24 hour period the highest point total was seen during amelia 1978 when fell upon central texas 15 see also edit tropical cyclones portal china tropical cyclone rainfall climatology extratropical cyclone list of wettest tropical cyclones by country tropical cyclone tropical
