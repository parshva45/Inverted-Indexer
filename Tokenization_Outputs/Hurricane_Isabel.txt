season the ninth named storm fifth hurricane and second major hurricane of the season isabel formed near the cape verde islands from a tropical wave on september 6 in the tropical atlantic ocean it moved northwestward and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of on september 11 after fluctuating in intensity for four days isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the outer banks of north carolina with winds of on september 18 it quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western pennsylvania the next day in north carolina the storm surge from isabel washed out a portion of hatteras island to form what was unofficially known as isabel inlet damage was greatest along the outer banks where thousands of homes were damaged or even destroyed the worst of the effects of isabel occurred in virginia especially in the hampton roads area and along the shores of rivers as far west and north as richmond and washington dc virginia reported the most deaths and damage from the hurricane about 64% of the damage and 68% of the deaths occurred in north carolina and virginia electric service was disrupted in

according to the scale a tropical wave moved off the western coast of africa on september 1 2 an area of low pressure associated with the wave moved slowly westward and its convection initially appeared to become better organized 3 on september 3 as it passed to the south of the cape verde islands organization within the system degraded 4 though convection increased the next day 5 the system gradually became better organized and dvorak classifications began early on september 5 based on the development of a closed surface circulation it is estimated the system developed into tropical depression thirteen early on september 6 hours later it intensified into tropical storm isabel 2 though operationally the national hurricane center did not begin issuing advisories until after it first developed 6 located within an area of light wind shear and warm waters isabel gradually organized as curved bands developed around a circular area of deep convection near the center 7 it steadily strengthened as it moved to the west northwest and isabel strengthened to a hurricane on september 7 subsequent to the development of a large yet ragged eye located near the deepest convection 8 the eye overall convective pattern and outflow steadily improved in organization 9 and deep convection quickly surrounded the 40 mile eye 10 isabel intensified on september 8 to reach major hurricane status while located east northeast of barbuda on september 9 isabel reached a primary peak intensity of for around a minimal hurricane on the hurricane scale 2 the eye of hurricane isabel as seen from the international space station broader view from the international space station early on september 10 the eyewall became less defined the convection near the eye became eroded and northeasterly outflow became slightly restricted 11 as a result isabel weakened slightly to a hurricane the hurricane turned more to the west due to the influence of the bermuda azores high 2 later on september 10 isabel restrengthened to a hurricane after convection deepened near the increasingly organizing eyewall 12 the hurricane continued to intensify and isabel reached its peak intensity of on september 11 a category 5 hurricane on the hurricane scale 2 due to an eyewall replacement cycle isabel weakened slightly though it retained status for 13 as isabel underwent another eyewall replacement cycle outflow degraded in appearance and convection around the eye weakened 14 and early on september 13 isabel weakened to a strong hurricane a weakness in the ridge to its north allowed the hurricane to turn to the west northwest 2 after completing the replacement cycle the large wide eye became better defined 15 and late on the 13th isabel re attained status 2 a noaa hurricane hunter reconnaissance aircraft flying into the hurricane launched a dropsonde which measured an instantaneous wind speed of the strongest instantaneous wind speed recorded in an atlantic hurricane 16 cloud tops warmed again shortly thereafter 17 and isabel weakened to a strong hurricane early on september 14 later that day it re organized and for the third time it attained status while located north of san juan puerto rico 2 cloud tops around the center warmed again early on september 15 and isabel weakened to a category 4 hurricane 2 later that day the inner core of deep convection began to deteriorate while the eye decayed in appearance as a ridge to its northwest build southeastward it resulted in isabel decelerating as it turned to the north northwest 18 increasing vertical wind shear contributed in weakening the hurricane further and isabel weakened to a hurricane on september 16 while located southeast of cape hatteras north carolina 2 convection remained minimal though outflow retained excellent organization 19 and isabel remained a hurricane for until it made landfall between cape lookout and ocracoke island on september 18 with winds of it weakened after it made landfall though due to its fast forward motion isabel remained a hurricane until it reached western virginia early on september 19 after passing through west virginia as a tropical storm isabel became extratropical over western pennsylvania near pittsburgh the system crossed lake erie into canada early on september 20 the extratropial remnant of isabel was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm over the cochrane district of ontario 2 preparations edit hurricane isabel making landfall in north carolina on september 18 two days before isabel made landfall the national

a ferry system were considered though they were ultimately canceled in favor of pumping sand and filling the inlet coastal geologists were opposed to the solution stating the evolution of the outer banks is dependent on inlets from hurricanes 75 dredging operations began on october 17 about a month after the hurricane struck the united states geological survey used sand from the ferry channel to the southwest of hatteras island a choice made to minimize the impact to submerged aquatic vegetation and due to the channel being filled somewhat during the hurricane 76 on november 22 about two
