objective was completed which was to deliver and connect the first set of u s provided solar arrays to the international space station the astronauts completed three spacewalks during which they prepared a docking port for arrival of the destiny laboratory module installed floating potential probes to measure electrical potential surrounding the station installed a camera cable outside the unity module and transferred supplies equipment and refuse between endeavour and the station 1 on flight day 3 commander brent jett linked endeavour to the iss while 230 statute miles above northeast kazakhstan the successful checkout of the extravehicular mobility units emus the simplified aid for eva rescue safer units the canadarm rms the orbiter space vision system osvs and the orbiter docking system ods were all completed nominally also the ods centerline camera was installed with no misalignment noted 1 from inside endeavour canadian mission specialist marc garneau used the canadarm to

expedition 1 crew residing in the space station until then the shuttle and the station had kept one hatch closed to maintain respective atmospheric pressures allowing the shuttle crew to conduct their spacewalks and mission goals after a welcome ceremony and briefing the eight spacefarers conducted structural tests of the station and its solar arrays transferred equipment supplies and refuse back and forth between the spacecraft and checked out the television camera cable installed by tanner and noriega for the upcoming mission 1 on 9 december 2000 the two crews completed final transfers of supplies to the station and other items being returned to earth the endeavour crew bade farewell to the expedition 1 crew at 10 51 est and closed the hatches between the spacecraft after being docked
