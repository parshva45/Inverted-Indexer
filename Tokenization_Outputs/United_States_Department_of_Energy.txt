the united states started the manhattan project a project to develop the atomic bomb under the eye of the u s army corps of engineers after the war in 1946 the atomic energy commission aec was created to control the future of the project 6 7 among other nuclear projects the aec produced fabricated uranium fuel cores at locations such as fernald feed materials production center in cincinnati ohio 8 9 10 in 1974 the aec gave way to the nuclear regulatory commission which was tasked with regulating the nuclear power industry and the energy research and development administration which was tasked to manage the nuclear weapon naval reactor and energy development programs citation needed the 1973 oil crisis called attention to the need to consolidate energy policy 11 12 13 on august 4 1977

from the code of federal regulations in title 10 energy 24 the official seal of the department of energy includes a green shield bisected by a gold colored lightning bolt on which is emblazoned a gold colored symbolic sun atom oil derrick windmill and dynamo it is crested by the white head of an eagle atop a white rope both appear on a blue field surrounded by concentric circles in which the name of the agency in gold appears on a green background the eagle represents the care in planning and the purposefulness of efforts required to respond to the increasing demands for energy the sun atom oil derrick windmill and dynamo serve as representative technologies whose enhanced development can help meet these demands the rope represents the cohesiveness in the development of the technologies and their link to our future capabilities the lightning bolt represents the power of the natural forces from which energy is derived and the challenge in harnessing the forces the color scheme is derived from nature symbolizing both the source of energy and the support of existence the blue field represents air and water green represents mineral resources and the earth itself and gold represents the creation of energy in the release of natural forces by invoking this symbolism the color scheme represents the commitment to meet its energy needs in a manner consistent with the preservation of the natural environment facilities edit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be

fund eight energy innovation hubs each of which is focused on a particular energy challenge two of the eight hubs are included in the eere budget and will focus on integrating smart materials designs and systems into buildings to better conserve energy and on designing and discovering new concepts and materials needed to convert solar energy into electricity another two hubs included in the doe office of science budget were created to tackle the challenges of devising advanced methods of energy storage and creating fuels directly from sunlight without the use of plants or microbes yet another hub was made to develop smart materials to allow the electrical grid to adapt and respond to changing conditions 27 in 2012 the doe awarded $120 million to the ames laboratory to start a new
