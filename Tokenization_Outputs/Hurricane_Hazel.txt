as an extratropical storm rivers and streams in and around toronto overflowed their banks which caused severe flooding as a result many residential areas located in the local floodplains such as the raymore drive area were subsequently converted to parkland in canada alone over c 2016 of damage was incurred the effects of hazel were particularly unprecedented in toronto due to a combination of heavy rainfall during the preceding weeks a lack of experience in dealing with tropical storms and the unexpected retention of power hazel had traveled over land but while approaching canada it had merged with an existing powerful cold front the storm stalled over the greater toronto area and although it was now extratropical it remained as powerful as a hurricane to help with the cleanup of the

to the scale on a tropical wave with tropical storm force winds was approaching the lesser antilles due to the potential for tropical storm formation a hurricane hunters plane flew from san juan puerto rico to investigate the system 1 when the plane reached the system they observed a tropical cyclone about east of the island of grenada with winds estimated at the united states weather bureau promptly classified the system as hurricane hazel 2 the atlantic hurricane reanalysis later assessed that hazel developed at on about east of grenada although the hurricane hunters observed hurricane force winds the storm had a small eye in diameter and a central barometric pressure of the winds were therefore revised downward to late on though it was estimated that the storm attained hurricane status at on at the same time hazel made landfall on grenada with winds of 3 after entering the caribbean sea hazel continued to present a small eye and wind diameter the winds gradually increased as the storm moved westward parallel to the northern venezuela coast on the tiny eye increased to a diameter of while the winds reached 3 although winds were estimated as high as that day the hurricane hunters encountered severe turbulence which hospitalized one crew member and injured another 4 for the next five days there were no further flights into the core of the hurricane although the planes continued to monitor the storm with radar imagery indicating that the eye became open and ragged late on it is estimated hazel intensified into a major hurricane with winds of originally it was estimated that hazel attained these winds the day prior the intensification was confirmed on when aircraft noted a well defined eye on radar imagery 3 on hazel slowed in the central caribbean and turned sharply to the north northeast toward hispaniola 3 steered by an upper level low 5 at on the hurricane made landfall near along the tiburon peninsula of haiti as a category 3 hurricane on the saffir simpson hurricane wind scale there were no strong wind readings at landfall but based on previous radar and aircraft observations the sustained winds were officially estimated at after moving through the gulf of hazel struck northwestern haiti near baie de henne at on as a category 2 hurricane with winds estimated at 3 around that time the hurricane curved more to the north and northwest due to an approaching trough 6 and the hurricane hunters resumed entering the center of hazel reporting an eye and hurricane force winds at on hazel struck inagua in the bahamas with winds of 3 the weston golf club was left submerged after the humber river overflowed its banks during hurricane hazel in toronto after affecting the bahamas hazel accelerated northwest toward the southeastern united states 3 steered between a trough and a ridge 6 hurricanes are generally expected to lose power after going north of florida due to lower water temperatures however hazel restrengthened as it tracked northward over the gulf stream 7 the hurricane hunters were unable to observe the core of the storm until it neared land reporting an eye in diameter on later that day a ship just offshore south carolina reported a central pressure of which was the lowest in association with the hurricane at on hazel made landfall just west of the north carolina south carolina border with a eye slightly northeast of myrtle beach in the latter state based on the pressure a larger than average size and the fast forward movement the landfall intensity was estimated at or a on the saffir simpson scale 3 the eye of hazel was tracked across several towns in north carolina as the system continued northward at on the hurricane became extratropical near raleigh and within six hours had passed near washington d c the extratropical remnants of hazel accelerated to the north through pennsylvania and new york along an extended cold front despite widespread observations across the eastern united states there was uncertainty in the track of hazel as an extratropical storm although it was possible the original circulation dissipated over western pennsylvania and a new one formed over western new york the atlantic hurricane reanalysis assessed the circulation as becoming elongated but continuous on the storm crossed into ontario and over the toronto region 3 shortly thereafter the former hurricane hazel dropped to gale force winds after moving almost over land 3 6 the storm slowed and turned northward passing over james bay early on after turning to the northeast the remnants of hazel were absorbed by a larger extratropical storm over canada on 6 preparations edit on october 6 small craft warnings were issued for the dutch islands of aruba bonaire and despite predictions that hazel would pass to the north 8 these warnings were canceled a day later 9 after the storm had turned northward tropical cyclone warnings were posted for haiti the dominican republic and the waters of the mona passage 10 small craft near jamaica were advised to head for port ahead of the storm 11 the u s navy completed extensive preparations at its guantanamo bay base ordering about 1,000 civilians into hardened fortified quonset huts flying aircraft out of the path and positioning surface ships out at sea 12 then on october 14 the national weather bureau issued a warning for the carolinas with the caveat that the worst of the hurricane was expected to stay offshore instead the storm took a sharp northwest turn and headed toward land 13 by evening of the same day the storm was forecast to make landfall near the carolinas border 13 further forecasts expected hazel to lose its power and dissipate over the allegheny mountains 6 in her book hurricane hazel canadian journalist betty kennedy argued that in canada the impressions that hazel was the best kept secret in town and that it was a fully documented meteorological event that should have taken nobody by surprise both paradoxically contain a great deal of truth 14 meteorologists predicted that if hazel merged with the cold front the storm would not lose intensity but would instead potentially strengthen two special weather bulletins were issued by the dominion weather office but since it was expected that the storm would pass east of toronto few other warnings were given and there were no evacuations which increased the eventual property damage and loss of life 6 the forecast called for high winds between and with only occasional showers on lakes erie and ontario ships received warnings of strong winds and the predicted wind speeds ranged from to 6 toronto hydro had called in standby crews as heavy winds were forecast although they were almost sent home at one point due to a lull in the storm 15 there had been significant rainfall in the toronto area in the two weeks prior to hazel so the ground was already saturated few people in canada had any experience with hurricanes since it was unheard of for them to travel as far north and inland as toronto 16 kennedy also notes that if toronto had been about to face a blizzard or was threatened by a 14 inch 36 cm snowfall that sic would have been

edit in the aftermath of hazel a three day period of national mourning was declared in haiti for hurricane victims with existing infrastructure already poor the recovery was very slow since many of the few existing roads were blocked and communications equipment was either out damaged or destroyed the haitian red cross appealed for assistance to the international red cross while the american red cross made a donation of $25,000 1954 usd pan american world airways offered the use of its planes to assist with the delivery of aid 52 and the us aircraft carrier uss saipan deployed 18 helicopters to help deliver supplies 53 despite the relief effort there was an outbreak of typhoid fever following hazel due to a lack of clean water 54 united states edit in the carolinas the national guard was mobilised by the evening of october 15 to prevent looting along affected areas of the coastline on october 17 president dwight d eisenhower declared a major disaster in the carolinas and offered immediate and unlimited federal assistance 55 recovery was quick and by october 24 all but two units were demobilised another concern was the rebuilding of the sand dunes along waterfronts an artificial sand dune barrier long was completed by october 30 which in the long run led to a more rapid natural build up of larger dunes with myrtle beach a popular tourist destination the chamber of commerce began an information campaign to inform the public which might have erroneously concluded from the massive media coverage that the city had been destroyed that the city would be ready for the coming summer the rebuilding after the partial destruction would transform myrtle beach from a quaint summer colony to a high rise resort city 56 canada edit main article effects of hurricane hazel in canada a weir was built on the humber river near raymore drive to lessen the risk of a similar catastrophic flood the army sent about to toronto to assist with the cleanup providing blankets and mattresses toronto residents helped out with the relief effort the salvation army received so many donations of clothes footwear blankets food and money that its storage facilities were overfilled forcing it to advise against further donations until they were needed 57 a hurricane relief fund was established to coordinate financial donations ultimately raising about cad the fund received donations from organisations companies and individuals including pope pius xii the ford motor company of canada the united church of canada laura secord candy shops and the british american oil company a portion of the fund was set aside as a contingency reserve in the event of unresolved claims and also toward administrative expenses 57 the toronto and region conservation authority was created after the storm to manage the floodplains and rivers such as building dams 58 the heavily flooded areas were expropriated and barred from rebuilding homes and most of the land was later converted into an extensive park system along rivers a footbridge dedicated to the victims crosses the humber river in raymore park which was the former raymore drive 59 retirement edit as a result of the catastrophic damage and severe death tolls in the caribbean united states and canada the name hazel was retired and will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane however since it was retired
