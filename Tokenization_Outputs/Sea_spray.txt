sea spray wikipedia sea spray from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search sea spray sea spray refers to aerosol particles that are formed directly from the ocean mostly by ejection into the atmosphere by bursting bubbles at the air sea interface 1 contents 1 composition 2 effects 3 chemical resistance 4 see also 5 references 6 external links composition edit sea salt aerosol ssa contains both inorganic salts and organic matter from the ocean 2 it is thought that the amount of organic matter transferred to ssa depends on microbiological activity 3 the organic matter in sea spray can contain dissolved organic matter 4 or even microbes themselves like bacteria and viruses 5 effects edit salt spray is largely responsible for corrosion of metallic objects near the coastline as the salts accelerate the corrosion process in the presence of abundant atmospheric oxygen and moisture salts do not dissolve in air directly but are suspended as fine particulates or dissolved in microscopic airborne water droplets chemical resistance edit the salt spray test is the notable measure of material endurance particularly if the material will be used outdoors and must perform in a mechanical load bearing or otherwise critical role these results are often of great interest to the marine industries whose products may suffer extreme acceleration of corrosion and subsequent failure due to the salt water environment see also edit coastal erosion cloud reflectivity modification sea air saltwater intrusion wind wave references edit lewis ernie schwartz stephen 2004 sea salt aerosol production mechanisms methods measurements and models washington dc american geophysical union isbn 087590-417-3 gantt brett meskhidze nicholas 2013 the physical and chemical characteristics of marine primary organic aerosol a review atmospheric chemistry and physics 13 8 doi 10 5194 acp 13 3979 2013 c d facchini m c cavalli f ceburnis d mircea m decesari s fuzzi s yoon y j putaud j p 2004 biogenically driven organic contribution to marine aerosol nature 431 7009 pmid 15470425 doi 10 1038 nature02959 russell l m hawkins l n frossard a a quinn p k bates t s 2010 carbohydrate like composition of submicron atmospheric particles and their production from ocean bubble bursting proc natl acad sci usa 107 15 pmc 2872374 pmid 20080571 doi 10 1073 pnas 0908905107 blanchard d c syzdek l d 1972 concentration of bacteria in jet drops from bursting bubbles j geophys res 77 27 5087 bibcode 1972jgr 77 5087b doi 10 1029 jc077i027p05087 external links edit wikimedia commons has media related to sea spray this oceanography article is a stub you can help wikipedia by expanding it v t e retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title sea spray oldid 775866324 categories oceanography oceanography stubs hidden categories all stub articles navigation menu personal tools not logged in talk contributions create account log in namespaces article talk variants views read edit view history more search navigation main page contents featured content current events random article donate to wikipedia wikipedia store interaction help about wikipedia community portal recent changes contact page tools what links here related changes upload file special pages permanent link page information wikidata item cite this page print export create a book download as pdf printable version in other projects wikimedia commons languages cymraeg edit links this page was last edited on 17 april 2017 at 15 29 text is available under the creative commons attribution sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
