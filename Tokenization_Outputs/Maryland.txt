charles i of england 55 alternatively some catholic scholars and historians believe maryland may have been named after mary the mother of jesus by george calvert 1st lord baltimore prior to his death in 1632 his original intent may never fully be known the specific name given in the charter was phrased terra mariae anglice maryland the english name was preferred due to undesired associations of mariae with the spanish jesuit juan de mariana linked to the inquisition in addition henrietta was never referred to by both her first and middle name scholars also agree that under no circumstances was a territory ever named after middle name many agree who that since the original capital of maryland was st city on the north shore of the potomac river and the county surrounding it the first erected created in the province 56 was named st county maryland was most likely named after mary the mother of jesus christ the great seal of maryland also supports this conclusion the obverse side of
