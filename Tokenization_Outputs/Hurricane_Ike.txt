hurricane ike pronounced k was a powerful tropical cyclone that swept through portions of the greater antilles and northern america in september 2008 wreaking havoc on infrastructure and agriculture particularly in cuba and texas other locations were also seriously affected by ike which was ultimately the fourth costliest of any atlantic hurricane and resulted in $37.5 billion in damages with only hurricanes sandy 2012 katrina 2005 and harvey 2017 estimated higher ike developed from a tropical wave west of cape verde on nb 1 and strengthened to a peak intensity as a over the open waters of the central atlantic on as it tracked westward several fluctuations in strength occurred before ike made landfall on eastern cuba on the hurricane weakened prior to continuing into the gulf of mexico but increased its intensity by the time of its final landfall on galveston texas on the remnants of ike continued to track across the united states and into canada causing considerable damage inland before dissipating two days later ike was blamed for at least 195 deaths of these deaths 74 were in haiti which was already trying to recover from the impact of three storms fay gustav and hanna which had made landfall that same year seven people were killed in cuba by ike 1 in the united states 113 people were reported killed directly or indirectly and 16 were still missing as of august 2011 2 due to its immense size ike caused devastation from the louisiana coastline all the way to the kenedy county region near corpus christi texas 3 in addition ike caused flooding and significant damage along the mississippi coastline and the florida panhandle 4 damages from ike in u s coastal and inland areas are estimated at 2 with additional damage of in cuba the costliest storm ever in that country $200 million in the bahamas and in the turks and caicos amounting to a total of at least in damage ike is currently the third costliest atlantic hurricane of all time only surpassed by hurricane katrina in 2005 and later by hurricane sandy in 2012 5 though initial cost estimates for hurricanes harvey 6 7 and irma 8 9 10 11 12 13 indicate both will surpass ike the search and rescue operation

storm according to the scale the origins of hurricane ike can be traced back to a well defined tropical wave first identified by the national hurricane center nhc just within the western coast of africa on 15 16 despite the development of a low pressure area associated with the wave and signs of organization within favorable conditions near the cape verde islands 17 the system was only able to generate intermittent thunderstorm activity the broad low pressure continued to track westward and was considered to have become sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical depression at 06 00 utc on by this time the cyclone had tracked 780 miles 1,260 kilometers west of cape verde although post analysis indicated that the depression reached tropical storm strength at that day 18 operationally the nhc began issuing advisories on ike three hours later by which time the system had already gained numerous curved rainbands and well established outflow 19 over the next few hours ike developed additional rainbands 20 but failed to a centralized area of convection due to the presence of dry air to the south and its location in an area with only marginally favorable sea surface temperatures 21 these factors were also responsible for slow developmental trend that began after formation 18 meteorological prediction of path on september 3 2008 gradual strengthening began to quicken early on with the strengthening of an intense rainband around the center of the storm at roughly that day microwave imaging indicated that a primordial eye was developing within the intensifying tropical storm 18 tracking northwestward the nhc upgraded ike to hurricane status at based on objective satellite intensity estimates and the appearance of the eye on visible satellite imagery 18 22 during this time ike was centered east northeast of the leeward islands and was tracking west northwestward as a result of a weakened subtropical ridge to its northeast 18 placement in an area with virtually no wind shear allowed for the hurricane to undergo explosive intensification despite unfavorable upper level winds to its north 22 reaching major hurricane strength six hours after its designation as a hurricane 23 at on ike peaked with maximum sustained winds of 145 miles per hour 233 kilometers per hour and a minimum barometric pressure of 935 millibars 27.6 inches of mercury making the storm a on the hurricane wind scale after peaking in strength a ridge of high pressure to the west strengthened causing ike to track towards the path unusual for the time of year however this track also brought the storm into an area of strong wind shear 18 causing the storm to become asymmetric in structure late on and weaken 24 briefly dropping below major hurricane status on while 150 miles east of grand turk island 25 although wind shear abated and allowed for reintensification ike would fluctuate in strength over the next few days after passing near the turks and caicos islands ike made its first landfall on inagua in the bahamas at on with winds of 26 after passing over inagua 26 the development of a double feature that usually denotes the beginning of an eyewall replacement cycle weakened ike late on 27 however the hurricane was able to reintensify and reach intensity for a final time before making landfall near cabo lucrecia on the coast of province in cuba by the next day 26 although ike remained well defined for most of its crossing of eastern cuba 28 the core had become disrupted by the time it had reached the caribbean sea after spending a few hours over land 29 over the next day ike tracked westward paralleling the southern coast of cuba without much intensification at times the center of the hurricane was within of the island at around on ike made a second cuban landfall this time on punta la capitana in pinar del rio with winds of roughly six hours later the hurricane emerged into the gulf of mexico as a slightly weakened system 26 despite tracking back over water prolonged interaction with cuba had greatly disrupted the core and instead of quickly strengthening and coalescing the wind field instead grew and only gradual intensification ensued 26 due to the comparatively small inner core and intensity of the outer rainbands 30 an eyewall replacement cycle took place preventing ike from rapidly intensifying at around the same time a high pressure area strengthened to the north steering the cyclone further west than initially anticipated moving over the warm waters of the loop current 26 ike reached a secondary minimum in barometric pressure on with an estimate of though winds would continue to strengthen afterward the pressure would rise 31 by late on ike had reached the western edge of the nearby high pressure area and began to curve northward the formation of an eye just prior to landfall resulted in a slight increase in winds 26 and at on ike made landfall on the northeast end of galveston island in texas with a minimum barometric pressure of and sustained winds of making ike a hurricane 31 after tracking inland ike weakened as it sped northward and later northeastward weakening to tropical storm status east of palestine texas late on and later becoming a powerful extratropical cyclone on over the ozarks 26 a more steady weakening phase ensued and after tracking across southern ontario and quebec the remnants of ike were absorbed by another extratropical low near the st lawrence river on 32 preparations edit turks and caicos and the bahamas edit fearing a repeat of hurricane

were particularly high in north carolina especially in the mountains where average prices were as much as 60 cents higher than the national average 74 the closing of refineries so soon after hurricane gustav and the time required to restart production also resulted in shortages of gasoline in such places as the carolinas and tennessee partly as a result of panic buying 75 113 direct and indirect

impacted by the hurricane stayed closed while only one hospital continued to operate but with a limit of patients 128 the need for mental health services increased after the disaster especially for depression and post traumatic stress disorder most individuals will not progress in constant behavioral or mental health problems but the world health organization estimates between five and ten percent of victims will have more long term issues 128 telephone interviews and mental health diagnoses were ordered randomly to households concerning the effects of hurricane ike post disaster mental health occurrences were 5.9 percent for post traumatic stress disorder 4.5 percent for major depressive episode and 9.9 percent for general anxiety disorder 129 a galveston bay recovery study gbrs was

physical abuse by parents and guardians because of loss of property and employment 128 results of post traumatic stress disorder depressive symptoms anxiety symptoms dysfunctions and disabilities were reported when asked how stressful their lives have been since hurricane ike 130 there was an increase of impairments interference with social activities and health behaviors such as eating poorly smoking more and restlessness 130 development of these mental health problems was due to the lack of sufficient clean clothing electricity food money transportation or water for at least one week victims and workers face numerous residential and occupational hazards during the process of repairing their homes or community an exposure to hazardous materials through the process created health threats of diseases air contamination smoke inhalation and lead poisoning as disaster victims return to their damaged homes children were exposed to the debris and other hazards developing a risk of injury 128 after the hurricane because of power outages individuals and family misused portable generators causing carbon monoxide poisoning eighty two percent to 87 percent of carbon monoxide were
