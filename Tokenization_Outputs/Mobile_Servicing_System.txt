mobile servicing system wikipedia mobile servicing system from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search astronaut stephen k robinson anchored to the end of canadarm2 during sts 114 2005 canadarm2 moves rassvet to berth with the station on sts 132 2010 the mobile servicing system mss is a robotic system on board the international space station iss launched to the iss in 2001 it plays a key role in station assembly and maintenance it moves equipment and supplies around the station supports astronauts working in space and services instruments and other payloads attached to the iss and is used for external maintenance astronauts receive specialized training to enable them to perform these functions with the various systems of the mss the mss is composed of three components the space station remote manipulator system ssrms known as canadarm2 the mobile remote servicer base system mbs and the special purpose dexterous manipulator spdm also known as dextre or canada hand the system can move along rails on the integrated truss structure on top of the us provided mobile transporter cart which hosts the mrs base system the control software was written in the ada 95 programming language 1 the mss was designed and manufactured by mda space missions previously called md robotics previously called spar aerospace for the canadian space agency s contribution to the

canadarm2 canadarm2 latching end effector canadarm2 captures cygnus 7 in late 2016 officially known as the space station remote manipulator system ssrms launched on sts 100 in april 2001 this second generation arm is a larger more advanced version of the space shuttle s original canadarm canadarm2 is when fully extended and has seven motorized joints an elbow hinge in the middle and three rotary joints at each of the wrist shoulder ends it has a mass of and a diameter of the arm is capable of handling large payloads of up to and was able to assist with docking the space shuttle it is self relocatable and can move end over end to reach many parts of the space station in an inchworm like movement in this movement it is limited only by the number of power data grapple fixtures pdgfs on the station pdgfs located around the station provide power data and video to the arm through either of its two latching end effectors lees the arm can also travel the entire length of the space station truss using the mobile base system in addition to moving itself around the station the arm can move any object with a grapple fixture in construction of the station the arm was used to move large segments into place it can also be used to capture unpiloted ships like the spacex dragon the cygnus spacecraft and japanese h ii transfer vehicle htv which are equipped with a standard grapple fixture which the canadarm2 uses to capture and dock the spacecraft the arm is also used to undock and release the spacecraft after use on board operators see what they are doing by looking at the three robotic work station rws lcd screens the mss has two rws units one located in the destiny module us lab module and the other in the cupola only one rws controls the mss at a time the rws has two sets of control joysticks one rotational hand controller rhc and one translational hand controller thc in addition to this is the display and control panel dcp and the portable computer system pcs laptop in recent years the majority of robotic operations are commanded remotely by flight controllers on the ground at mission control center nasa or from the canadian space agency operators can work in shifts to accomplish objectives with more flexibility than when done by on board crew operators albeit at a slower pace astronaut operators are used for time critical operations such as visiting vehicle captures and robotics supported extra vehicular activity latching end effectors edit lee drawing latching end effector lee canadarm2 has two lees one at each end a lee has 3 snare wires to catch the grapple fixture shaft 2 special purpose dexterous manipulator edit main article dextre the special purpose dexterous manipulator or dextre is a smaller two armed robot that can attach to canadarm2 the iss or the mobile base system the arms and its power tools are capable of handling the delicate assembly tasks and changing orbital replacement units orus currently handled by astronauts during space walks although canadarm2 can move around the station in an inchworm motion unable to carry anything with it unless dextre is attached testing was done in the space simulation chambers of the canadian space david florida laboratory in ottawa the manipulator was launched to the station 11 march 2008 on sts 123 dextre and canadarm2 docked side by side on power data grapple fixtures mobile base system edit the mobile base system just before canadarm2 installed it on the mobile transporter during sts 111 the mobile remote servicer base system mbs is a base platform for the robotic arms it was added to the station during sts 111 in june 2002 the platform rests atop the mobile transporter 3 installed on sts 110 designed by northrop grumman in carpinteria ca which allows it to glide 108 metres down rails on the main truss 4 canadarm2 can relocate by itself but carry at the same time dextre relocate by itself the mbs gives the two robotic arms the ability to travel to work sites all along the truss structure and to step off onto grapple fixtures along the way when canadarm2 and dextre are attached to the mbs they have a combined mass of 5 like canadarm2 it was built by md robotics and it has a minimum service life of 15 years 6 7 the mbs is equipped with 4 power data grapple fixtures one at each of its four top corners any of these can be used as a base for the two robots canadarm2 and dextre as well as any of the payloads that might be held by them the mbs also has 2 locations to attach payloads the first is the payload orbital replacement unit accommodations poa this is a device that looks and functions much like the latching end effectors of canadarm2 it can be used to park power and command any payload with a grapple fixture while keeping canadarm2 free to do something else the other attachment location is the mbs common attachment system mcas this is another type of attachment system that is used to host scientific experiments 6 the mbs also supports astronauts during extra vehicular activities it has locations to store tools and equipment foot restraints handrails and safety tether attachment points as well as a camera assembly if needed it is even possible for an astronaut to ride the mbs while it moves at a top speed of about 1.5 meters per minute 3 on either side of the mbs are the crew and equipment translation aids these carts ride on the same rails as the mbs astronauts ride them manually during evas to transport equipment and to facilitate their movements around the station canadarm2 riding the mobile base system along the mobile transporter railway running the length of the main truss enhanced iss boom assembly edit main article orbiter boom sensor system iss boom assembly installed on may 27 2011 is a 50 foot boom
