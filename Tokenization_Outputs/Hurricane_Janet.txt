1955 atlantic hurricane season and one of the strongest atlantic hurricanes on record the eleventh tropical storm ninth hurricane and fifth major hurricane of the year nb 1 janet formed from a tropical wave east of the lesser antilles on moving westward across the caribbean sea janet fluctuated in intensity but generally strengthened before reaching its peak intensity as a hurricane with winds of the intense hurricane later made landfall at that intensity near chetumal mexico on after weakening over the peninsula it moved into the bay of campeche where it slightly strengthened before making its final landfall near veracruz on janet quickly weakened over mountainous terrain before dissipating on in its developmental stages janet caused in damage to the lesser antilles and in the grenadines and barbados nb 2 while janet was in the central caribbean sea a reconnaissance aircraft flew into the storm and was lost with all eleven crew members believed to be perished this remains the only such loss which has occurred in association with an atlantic hurricane a upon landfall on the peninsula janet caused severe devastation in areas of quintana roo and british honduras only five buildings in chetumal mexico remained intact after the storm and an estimated occurred in the mexican state of quintana roo at second landfall near veracruz significant river flooding ensued worsening effects caused by hurricanes gladys and hilda earlier in the month the floods left thousands of people stranded and killed at least in the tampico area leading to the largest mexican relief operation ever executed by the united states landfall as a hurricane on the peninsula was the first recorded instance that a storm of such intensity in the atlantic made landfall on a continental mainland prior to janet landfalls of intensity were only known to have taken place on islands 2 minimum barometric pressure recorded in chetumal was at the time the second lowest recorded pressure on land associated

references meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the scale a weak tropical disturbance was first reported by the air france and iberia airlines east of the lesser antilles early on although it was speculated that the disturbance originated from a tropical wave near cape verde the weather bureau considered the system too weak to be detected due to a lack of reports from the islands 3 at 1800 utc on while it was located east southeast of martinique 4 5 the disturbance became sufficiently organized for the weather bureau to classify it as tropical storm janet the tenth named storm of the season 5 upon classification janet quickly intensified as it moved to the west 4 6 on janet attained hurricane strength and proceeded to intensify rapidly as it moved westward across the windward islands 3 by that day janet already attained hurricane strength with maximum sustained winds of before stalling in intensification 4 shortly after on the eye of janet passed over barbados 7 a reconnaissance flight into the hurricane discovered that the hurricane eye measured only in diameter 3 with gale force winds extending away from the center of circulation 6 the flight also reported a minimum barometric pressure of 979 mbar hpa 28.91 inhg after passing between the islands of grenada and carriacou in the morning hours of janet entered an area of unfavorable conditions in the eastern caribbean sea 3 as a result the hurricane became disorganized with winds weakening to by on 4 3 a u s navy reconnaissance plane entered the hurricane early on reporting a lack of organization and noting an indiscernible center of circulation with weak rainbands 3 however the hurricane began to reintensify in favorable conditions regaining major hurricane strength by on and subsequently category intensity by the next day 6 4 graph of barometer readings in chetumal while trekking across the central caribbean sea janet was only slightly larger than while

on janet began accelerating in forward speed 6 after the reconnaissance flight snowcloud five was lost while making a penetration into the eye another flight early on reported a minimum pressure of hpa with winds in excess of by a large and incalculable amount 3 the hurricane was estimated to have intensified to hurricane highest rating on the modern day hurricane scale on while in the western caribbean sea janet continued to intensify afterwards eventually reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 4 with gale force winds having expanded to at least away from the center of the hurricane 6 janet maintained peak intensity as it passed over the swan islands before making landfall in extreme southern quintana roo mexico just east of chetumal mexico in that city a barometer indicated a minimum barometric pressure of hpa in the eye of janet 3 at the time this was the second lowest pressure ever recorded on land in a landfalling atlantic hurricane behind the 1935 labor day hurricane 3 though janet was later surpassed by hurricanes dean and gilbert which also made landfall on the peninsula as hurricanes 8 once over land janet considerably weakened to a hurricane with winds of after crossing the peninsula with a forward speed of the hurricane emerged into the bay of campeche by on 4 6 the weakened hurricane marginally intensified as it crossed the bay of campeche to a secondary peak intensity of with a minimum central pressure of hpa 4 janet eventually made its final landfall north of the city of veracruz by on as a hurricane after moving inland the hurricane became quickly disorganized due to the highly mountainous terrain of mexico and as a result the weather bureau issued its last advisory on janet 6 the weakening system degenerated to tropical storm strength by and later dissipated over central mexico by that day 4 remnant circulation contributed to the development of a disturbed area of weather off the western coast of mexico that would subsequently develop into a tropical storm on 6 preparations edit caribbean islands edit upon formation east of the windward islands the weather bureau office in san juan puerto rico advised small craft to remain in port and vessels in the path of the developing storm to exercise caution after a reconnaissance flight reported much stronger winds than initially suggested hurricane warnings were

the island in since the 1898 windward islands hurricane maximum sustained winds on the south side of the island were estimated to be between 3 the strong winds knocked out communication lines preventing officials from accurately enumerating casualties on the island 14 though communications were still maintained by commercial cable companies and amateur radio 15 electric power was later

operation took place over a large area of the caribbean sea with involved with the search returning no results 29 the exact cause of the crash remains unknown though it is speculated that the altimeter gave an incorrect reading due to the low surrounding barometric pressure 30 although four hurricane reconnaissance flights have been lost since operations began in 1943 snowcloud five remains the only known loss of a reconnaissance aircraft as a result of a hurricane in the atlantic basin with the other three occurring as a result of pacific typhoons 31 peninsula edit damage in

strong storm surge including the main streets and port 46 operations along a railroad stretching from laredo texas to mexico city were stopped after having just reopened due to hurricane hilda 51 farther inland as janet dissipated over the mountainous central mexico the storm dropped torrential rainfall over the tamisi and panuco river basins 52 the water levels in the panuco river remained above flood stage for four weeks 53 in tampico the river flooded neighborhoods forcing cables to be stretched along roads to prevent people from being swept away small boats were also sent to monitor streets 54 according to some sources died from the floods with thousands more being stranded in the city 52 tamazunchale was inundated by an overflowing moctezuma river 55 the rains caused a landslide

barbados the island was declared a state of emergency 16 relief workers on barbados helped to clean up debris scattered by the strong winds on highways and the local government made requests for food and construction materials 59 the extensive damaged caused by janet on the island to low income households led the passage of the act which created the national housing authority nha in 1956 the nha was responsible for the acquisition of lands on which houses could be built with stronger and more permanent materials which was thought to minimize maintenance costs and hurricane related damage the newly founded organization quickly worked to rebuild homes after the hurricane struck 60 in grenada the governor issued an emergency order against the hoarding of food in the aftermath of janet due to the food and water shortage that resulted from janet a united states destroyer and a british frigate were sent to bring relief supplies to grenada and ships departing from jamaica and trinidad were redirected to the island to help send supplies 61 the british government later announced that it would send 50,000 us 155 000 in relief to the grenadines nb 3 63 the crown agents and red cross delivered relief supplies to barbados and the grenadines which included aluminum roofing sheets and portable electric generators 64 british honduras and mexico edit relief and reconstruction measures were enacted in the british honduras beginning on 39 a large scale reconstruction program was initiated by the government to help rebuild 65 the government also declared a state of emergency for corozal orange walk and belize administrative districts including a ban on liquor sales temporary communication lines were rebuilt which initially only allowed official communications with affected areas due to the severity of the damage in corozal an airstrip was built to help deliver relief to the city more efficiently food depots in corozal louisville and orange walk town were tasked with distributing food the potential for widespread disease following the devastation wrought by janet forced a widespread vaccination initiative against typhoid fever in affected areas 39 the jamaican government sent us 55 000 to the colony in relief funds 64 while the british government sent us 110 000 to affected areas in the british honduras and other affected islands in the caribbean the united states sent the cargo ship uss antares which supplied the colony with various relief materials 39 in corozal town a grant was given to land surveyor h c fairweather to plan and reconstruct the township 66 a u s navy relief plane was sent to chetumal mexico to deliver food and other relief supplies after janet struck the region 67 in areas previously affected by hurricanes gladys and hilda earlier in the year federal relief agencies were ordered to extend relief operations to the peninsula 38 however after crossing the bay of campeche and making landfall near veracruz relief measures were once again implemented in the western gulf coast of mexico the mexican air force commercial and private planes and helicopters were sent to bring relief supplies and airlift refugees 68 the united states initiated the largest relief campaign ever staged in mexico at the time various government and relief agencies including the american red cross and the salvation army participated in the relief efforts 69 the united states air force and united states army began a joint relief operation to send relief supplies to the tampico area beginning with the deployment of a curtiss c 46 commando from the harlingen air force base on 47 ten other military transport aircraft from the united states air force were sent from texas to provide food and clothing pan american world airways sent a boeing 314 from miami florida to evacuate victims 56 helicopters were sent from the uss saipan to transfer food and medical supplies from the light aircraft carrier other ships also aided in
