new zealand super 12 teams and were originally called the wellington hurricanes the first coach was former all black frank oliver while bull allen was named as captain their first match played at palmerston north showgrounds against the auckland blues was the first ever super rugby match they lost it the team performed below expectations in the inaugural year of the competition and finished ninth in 1997 the team made the semi finals losing in canberra to the act brumbies however the consistent form shown during this season would not be seen again for many years expect the unexpected edit following their 1997 season the hurricanes failed to qualify for the semi finals until 2003 despite this they were still known for the attacking nature of their backline that included the all blacks stars tana umaga and christian cullen the team played with flair and could score at any moment whatever their position on the field giving rise to the teams catch cry of expect the unexpected however the team struggled for consistent performances and at crunch time in matches leading to patchy form and results after the 1999 world cup jonah lomu s contract with the nzru expired he was linked to many clubs around the world in rugby league as well as union and also the nfl s dallas cowboys 3 on 23 november 1999 it was announced that the winger had resigned from the nzru and agreed terms with the wellington rugby union despite a reported a offer by bristol 3 4 the move to the wellington union meant he could be included in the protected group of players for the hurricanes the hurricanes also opened 2000 with a new stadium the highlights of that year included the victory over eventual champions the crusaders in front of a packed house at the end of the season the canes still had a mathematical chance of making the semis and only had to beat the bulls to stay in contention however the hurricanes played one of their worst games of the year losing the match to one of the worst performing teams at that point in the history and lost the possibility of qualifying for the semi finals the team finished eighth on the table despite the wellington lions whom most of the hurricanes squad were chosen from winning the 2000 npc 5 the hurricanes finished ninth in the final standings in 2001 one worse than the year before another ninth placing in 2002 resulted in graham mourie who had led the team since 2000 resigning 6 new era since 2003 edit this section needs expansion with information from 2006 onward you can help by adding to it september 2011 the hurricanes playing the highlanders at westpac stadium in 2006 in spite of reports that colin cooper the then crusaders assistant coach had said he was not yet ready to jump ship and wanted to stay with the south island franchise 7 the hurricanes were able to lure him away from the champions and made him their head coach for the 2003 season cooper along with newly appointed captain tana umaga helped to mould the inconsistent and ill disciplined hurricanes into one of the top teams in the competition 8 2003 was the beginning of a new era for the hurricanes as they reached the semi finals for just the second time in their history on the back of a strong seven game winning streak mid season their success came partly with the break out year for mid fielder nonu his strong performances and partnership with captain tana umaga pushed out former all black pita alatini and saw him score six tries en route to the all black squad the team also benefited from the steady hand of david holwell at first five eighth and an improving and mobile forward pack hurricanes stalwart christian cullen would leave new zealand shores for irish club munster after his omission from the all blacks 2003 world cup squad despite scoring eight tries during the season all black great jonah lomu was left out of the 2004 squad due to a life threatening illness that would eventually result in a kidney transplant he would never again play for the hurricanes the majority of the team was retained for 2005 9 including new centre conrad smith 10 the hurricanes came back in 2005 to the form that saw them make the playoffs two years prior former new zealand colt flyhalf jimmy gopperth was the real find of the season scoring 139 points which helped offset the departure of david holwell to ireland the hurricanes had tried to sign australian playmaker brock james who had starred the previous npc season for taranaki 11 and the blues and young star luke mcalister indicated that he would like to play in wellington 12 with both daniel carter and aaron mauger at the crusaders capable of playing first five eighth the team also made an attempt to lure andrew mehrtens to wellington without success in 2006 two new teams entered the competition the bloemfontein based cheetahs from south africa and the perth based western force from australia creating the super 14 rodney was appointed captain of the hurricanes to succeed former all black captain tana umaga 13 the team won all but four matches they made their first super rugby final but lost to the crusaders in a match played under thick fog following the match there was an incident in a nightclub involving chris masoe and tana umaga the club finances benefitted from on pitch success with profit on its 2006 turnover of the hurricanes returned to the semi

hurricanes matches in the initial years of the competition the hurricanes played once or occasionally twice away from their wellington base depending on whether they had five or six games per year such a policy was welcomed given the large geographic area that the team was drawn from however in recent years the team has seldom ventured from wellington despite the expansion to 14 and now 15
