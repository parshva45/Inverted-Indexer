revealing that he does not believe in god although he claims he is not an atheist either which he calls another religion pointing out that some atheists such as brian griffin have been just as

of religion and faith tested as the storm worsens a hungry cleveland confronts his son over the possibility of having food stored in his room cleveland jr explains he used a very scientific method to ration the food when the family is still resistant to his non religious lifestyle accusing him of wanting the food all to himself cleveland jr locks the food away in spite cleveland calls on god to

help cleveland jr is able to rig together a pulley system and lifts the tree using his own weight the family disagrees over whether god was involved in cleveland actions and the belief of cleveland jr is left unresolved as the hurricane heads for quahog production and development edit there were talks initially of doing a crossover with all the characters from all the shows but it became a little bit of a conundrum because you have three different staffs each of whom is used to writing three different sets of characters this idea of an outside force that sweeps its way through all three shows seemed like a cool way to accomplish that macfarlane in an interview with the hollywood reporter 2 3 kirker butler wrote the episode the crossover event was first announced in july 2010 by series creator seth macfarlane at the comic con international in san diego california it was the first of its kind in the history of the animated television line up on fox 4 5 kevin reilly the entertainment president of the fox broadcasting company originally pitched the idea for the crossover which was inspired by theme nights of comedy shows from the 1980s 2 6 macfarlane described the crossover event to be an enormous challenge and a substantial undertaking he chose to do one central story line so that each writing staff would not have to write stories for unfamiliar characters 2 he was also willing to do another crossover event if this one receives successful ratings 2 in april 2011 the executives of the fox broadcasting company officially announced that the episode would air on may 1 as part of the night of the hurricane crossover alongside the family guy episode seahorse seashell party and the american dad episode hurricane 7 however on april 29 it was announced that the crossover event would be removed from the schedule in response to a series of tornadoes that killed nearly 300 people in the southern united states 6 8 9 10 11 12 the crossover was subsequently replaced by repeats of i am the walrus from american dad brian writes a bestseller from family guy and nothin but mutton bustin from the cleveland show 1 8 12 macfarlane later agreed with the decisions after being consulted with the executives of fox and a spokeswoman for the company later announced that the episode would air the succeeding season 8 ratings edit the hurricane first aired in the united states on october 2 2011 as part of the animation television night on fox it was preceded by episodes of the simpsons and its sister shows american dad and family guy it was viewed by 4.73 million
