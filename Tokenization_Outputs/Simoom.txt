arabic from the root s m m to poison is a strong dry dust laden wind usually used to describe a local wind that blows in the sahara palestine jordan syria and the deserts of arabian peninsula its temperature may exceed and the humidity may fall below 10 alternative spellings include samoon samun simoun and simoon another name used for this wind is samiel persian samyeli simoom winds have an alternative type occurring in the region of central asia known as garmsil the name means poison wind and is given because the sudden onset of simoom may also cause heat stroke this is attributed to the fact that the hot wind brings more heat to the body than can be disposed of by the evaporation of perspiration the nuttall described the simoom the storm moves in cyclone circular form carrying clouds of dust and sand and produces on humans and animals a suffocating effect 1 a 19th century account of simoom in egypt reads egypt is also subject particularly during the spring and summer to the hot wind called the samoom which is still more oppressive than the khamasin winds but of much shorter duration seldom lasting longer than a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes it generally proceeds from the south east or south south east and carries with it clouds of dust and sand 2 contents 1 in north america 2 figurative use of the word 3 see also 4 references 5 external links in north america edit it has been alleged that a simoom occurred on june 17 1859 in goleta and santa barbara california for example local historian walker tompkins wrote that during the morning the temperature hovered around the normal 24 to 75 to but around 1 p m strong super hot winds filled with dust began to blow from the direction of the santa ynez mountains to the north by 2 p m the temperature supposedly reached this temperature was said to have been recorded by an official u s coastal survey vessel that was operating in the waters just offshore in the santa barbara channel at 5 p m the temperature had reportedly dropped to and by 7 p m the temperature was back to a normal tompkins provided a supposed quote from a u s government report saying calves rabbits and cattle died on their feet fruit fell from trees to the ground scorched on the windward side all vegetable gardens were ruined a fisherman in a rowboat made it to the goleta sandspit with his face and arms blistered as if he had been exposed to a blast furnace 3 also according to tompkins local inhabitants were saved from the heat by seeking shelter in the thick adobe walled houses that were the standard construction at the time however experts contest this account ucsb professor joel michaelsen for instance said have never found any outside source to validate tompkins story and i am highly skeptical of its veracity i doubt that strong hot dry downslope winds could kick up lots of dust and produce very high temperatures but in the 110 f 115 f range at most the 133 f just physically reasonable as it would require the creation of an extremely hot air mass somewhere to the northeast last weather was a very good strong example of the sort of conditions that would produce such a heat wave and our temperatures topped out at least 20 degrees below tompkins figure stronger winds could have increased the heating a bit but not nearly that much add to all that meteorologically based skepticism tompkins well known tendency to mix liberal doses of fiction into his histories and i think you have a strong case for discounting this 4 meteorologist christopher c burt writing on weather underground says about the alleged incident there is no record of who made this measurement or exactly where it was made in santa barbara some later sources say it was made on a u s coastal geo survey vessel if that is the case then the temperature is not possible since the waters off santa barbara in june are never warmer than about and any wind blowing over the ocean would have its temperature modified by the cool water no matter how hot the air this report is singular and there is physical evidence burnt crops and dead animals that something amazing happened here this day but the temperature record is impossible to validate 5 figurative use of the word edit edgar allan poe s short story ms found in a bottle 1833 features a storm off the coast of java wherein every appearance warranted me the protagonist narrator in apprehending a simoom in the political essay chartism thomas carlyle argues that even the poorest of men who have resigned themselves to misery and toil cannot resign themselves to injustice because they retain an innate sense that a higher divine justice must govern the world force itself the hopelessness of resistance has doubtless a composing effect against inanimate simooms and much other infliction of the like sort we have found it suffice to produce complete composure yet one would say a permanent injustice even from an infinite power would prove unendurable by men walden 1854 by henry david thoreau references a simoom he uses it to describe his urge to escape something most unwanted there is no odor so bad as that which arises from goodness tainted it is human it is divine carrion if i knew for a certainty that a man was coming to my house with the conscious design of doing me good i should run for my life as from that dry and parching wind of the african deserts called

rather suffer evil the natural way in his 1854 novel hard times charles dickens in describing the oppressive midsummer heat of the sooty smoky factories of coketown writes the atmosphere of those
