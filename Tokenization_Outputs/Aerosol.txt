aerosol wikipedia aerosol from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search mist and clouds are aerosols an aerosol is a colloid of fine solid particles or liquid droplets in air or another gas 1 aerosols can be natural or anthropogenic examples of natural aerosols are fog dust forest exudates and geyser steam examples of anthropogenic aerosols are haze particulate air pollutants and smoke 1 the liquid or solid particles have diameter mostly smaller than 1 or so larger particles with a significant settling speed make the mixture a suspension but the distinction is not clear cut in general conversation aerosol usually refers to an aerosol spray that delivers a consumer product from a can or similar container other technological applications of aerosols include dispersal of pesticides medical treatment of respiratory illnesses and combustion technology 2 diseases can also spread by means of small droplets in the breath also called aerosols 3 aerosol science covers

magnification most of the particles in this aerosol are nearly spherical an aerosol is defined as a colloidal system of solid or liquid particles in a gas an aerosol includes both the particles and the suspending gas which is usually air 1 frederick g donnan presumably first used the term aerosol during world war i to describe an aero solution clouds of microscopic particles in air this term developed analogously to the term hydrosol a colloid system with water as the dispersing medium 4 primary aerosols contain particles introduced directly into the gas secondary aerosols form through gas to particle conversion 5 various types of aerosol classified according to physical form and how they were generated include dust fume mist smoke and fog 6 there are several measures of aerosol concentration environmental science and health often uses the mass concentration m defined as the mass of particulate matter per unit volume with units such as 3 also commonly used is the number concentration n the number of particles per unit volume with units such as number m 3 or number cm 3 7 the size of particles has a major influence on their properties and the aerosol particle radius or diameter d p is a key property used to characterise aerosols aerosols vary in their dispersity a monodisperse aerosol producible in the laboratory contains particles of uniform size most aerosols however as polydisperse colloidal systems exhibit a range of particle sizes 8 liquid droplets are almost always nearly spherical but scientists use an equivalent diameter to characterize the properities of various shapes of solid particles some very irregular the equivalent diameter is the diameter of a spherical particle with the same value of some physical property as the irregular particle 9 the equivalent volume diameter d e is defined as the diameter of a sphere of the same volume as that of the irregular particle 10 also commonly used is the aerodynamic diameter size distribution edit the same hypothetical log normal aerosol distribution plotted from top to bottom as a number vs diameter distribution a surface area vs diameter distribution and a volume vs diameter distribution typical mode names are shows at the top each distribution is normalized so that the total area is 1000 for a monodisperse aerosol a single particle to describe the size of the particles however more complicated particle size distribution s describe the sizes of the particles in a polydisperse aerosol this distribution defines the relative amounts of particles sorted according to size 11 one approach to defining the particle size distribution uses a list of the sizes of every particle in a sample however this approach proves tedious to ascertain in aerosols with millions of particles and awkward to use another approach splits the complete size range into intervals and finds the number or proportion of particles in each interval one then can visualize these data in a histogram with the area of each bar representing the proportion of particles in that size bin usually normalised by dividing the number of particles in a bin by the width of the interval so that the area of each bar is proportionate to the number of particles in the size range that it represents 12 if the width of the bins tends to zero one gets the frequency function 13 d f f d p d d p where d p is the diameter of the particles d f is the fraction of particles having diameters between d p and d p d d p f d p is the frequency function therefore the area under the frequency curve between two sizes a and b represents the total fraction of the particles in that size range 14 f a b a b f d p d d p it can also be formulated in terms of the total number density n 15 d n n d p d d p assuming spherical aerosol particles the aerosol surface area per unit volume s is given by the second moment 15 s 2 0 n d p d p 2 d d p and the third moment gives the total volume concentration v of the particles 15 v 6 0 n d p d p 3 d d p one also usefully can approximate the particle size distribution using a mathematical function the normal distribution usually does not suitably describe particle size distributions in aerosols because of the skewness associated a long tail of larger particles also for a quantity that varies over a large range as many aerosol sizes do the width of the distribution implies negative particles sizes clearly not physically realistic however the normal distribution can be suitable for some aerosols such as test aerosols certain pollen grains and spores 16 a more widely chosen log normal distribution gives the number frequency as 16 d f 1 2 e d p d p 2 2 2 d d p where is the standard deviation of the size distribution and d p is the arithmetic mean diameter the log normal distribution has no negative values can cover a wide range of values and fits many observed size distributions reasonably well 17 other distributions sometimes used to characterise particle size include the rosin rammler distribution applied to coarsely dispersed dusts and sprays the nukiyama tanasawa distribution for sprays of extremely broad size ranges the power function distribution occasionally applied to atmospheric aerosols the exponential distribution applied to powdered materials and for cloud droplets the khrgian mazin distribution 18 physics edit terminal velocity of a particle in a fluid edit for low values of the reynolds number 1 true for most aerosol motion stokes law describes the force of resistance on a solid spherical particle in a fluid however stokes law is only valid when the velocity of the gas at the surface of the particle is zero for small particles 1 that characterize aerosols however this assumption fails to account for this failure one can introduce the cunningham correction factor always greater than 1 including this factor one finds the relation between the resisting force on a particle and its velocity 19 f d 3 v d c c where f d is the resisting force on a spherical particle is the viscosity of the gas v is the particle velocity c c is the cunningham correction factor this allows us to calculate the terminal velocity of a particle undergoing gravitational settling in still air neglecting buoyancy effects we find 20 v t s p d 2 g c c 18 where v t s is the terminal settling velocity of the particle the terminal velocity can also be derived for other kinds of forces if stokes law holds then the resistance to motion is directly proportional to speed the constant of proportionality is the mechanical mobility b of a particle 21 b v f d c c 3 d a particle traveling at any reasonable initial velocity approaches its terminal velocity exponentially with an e folding time equal to the relaxation time 22 v t v f v f v 0 e t where v t is the particle speed at time t v f is the final particle speed v 0 is the initial particle speed to account for the effect of the shape of non spherical particles a correction factor known as the dynamic shape factor is applied to stokes law it is defined as the ratio of the resistive force of the irregular particle to that of a spherical particle with the same volume and velocity 23 f d 3 v d e where is the dynamic shape factor aerodynamic diameter edit the aerodynamic diameter of an irregular particle is defined as the diameter of the spherical particle with a density of 3 and the same settling velocity as the irregular particle 24 neglecting the slip correction the particle settles at the terminal velocity proportional to the square of the aerodynamic diameter d a 24 v t s 0 d a 2 g 18 where 0 standard particle density 1000 kg m 3 this equation gives the aerodynamic diameter 25 d a d e p 0 1 2 one can apply the aerodynamic diameter to particulate pollutants or to inhaled drugs to predict where in the respiratory tract such particles deposit pharmaceutical companies typically use aerodynamic diameter not geometric diameter to characterize particles in inhalable drugs citation needed dynamics edit the previous discussion focussed on single aerosol particles in contrast aerosol dynamics explains the evolution of complete aerosol populations the concentrations of particles will change over time as a result of many processes external processes that move particles outside a volume of gas under study include diffusion gravitational settling and electric charges and other external forces that cause particle migration a second set of processes internal to a given volume of gas include particle formation nucleation evaporation chemical reaction and coagulation 26 a differential equation called the aerosol general dynamic equation gde characterizes the evolution of the number density of particles in an aerosol due to these processes 26 n i t n i q d p i n i t g r o w t h n i t c o a g q f n i change in time convective transport brownian diffusion gas particle interactions coagulation migration by external forces where n i is number density of particles of size category i q is the particle velocity d p is the particle stokes einstein diffusivity q f is the particle velocity associated with an external force coagulation edit as particles and droplets in an aerosol collide with one another they may undergo coalescence or aggregation this process leads to a change in the aerosol particle size distribution with the mode increasing in diameter as total number of particles decreases 27 on occasion particles may shatter apart into numerous smaller particles however this process usually occurs primarily in particles too large for consideration as aerosols dynamics regimes edit the knudsen number of the particle define three different dynamical regimes that govern the behaviour of an aerosol k n 2 d where is the mean free path of the suspending gas and d is the diameter of the particle 28 for particles in the free molecular regime k n 1 particles small compared to the mean free path of the suspending gas 29 in this regime particles interact with the suspending gas through a series of ballistic collisions with gas molecules as such they behave similarly to gas molecules tending to follow streamlines and diffusing rapidly through brownian motion the mass flux equation in the free molecular regime is i a 2 k b p t p a t a c a where a is the particle radius p and p a are the pressures far from the droplet and at the surface of the droplet respectively k b is the boltzmann constant t is the temperature c a is mean thermal velocity and is mass accommodation coefficient citation needed the derivation of this equation assumes constant pressure and constant diffusion coefficient particles are in the continuum regime when k n 1 29 in this regime the particles are big compared to the mean free path of the suspending gas meaning that the suspending gas acts as a continuous fluid flowing round the particle 29 the molecular flux in this regime is i c o n t 4 a m a d a b r t p a p a s where a is the radius of the particle a m a is the molecular mass of the particle a d ab is the diffusion coefficient between particles a and b r is the ideal gas constant t is the temperature in absolute units like kelvin and p and p as are the pressures at infinite and at the surface respectively citation needed the transition regime contains all the particles in between the free molecular and continuum regimes or k n 1 the forces experienced by a particle are a complex combination of interactions with individual gas molecules and macroscopic interactions the semi empirical equation describing mass flux is i i c o n t 1 k n 1 1.71 k n 1.33 k n 2 where i cont is the mass flux in the continuum regime citation needed this formula is called the fuchs sutugin interpolation formula these equations do not take into account the heat release effect partitioning edit condensation and evaporation aerosol partitioning theory governs condensation on and evaporation from an aerosol surface respectively condensation of mass causes the mode of the particle size distributions of the aerosol to increase conversely evaporation causes the mode to decrease nucleation is the process of forming aerosol mass from the condensation of a gaseous precursor specifically a vapour net condensation of the vapour requires supersaturation a partial pressure greater than its vapour pressure this can happen for three reasons citation needed lowering the temperature of the system lowers the vapour pressure chemical reactions may increase the partial pressure of a gas or lower its vapour pressure the addition of additional vapour to the system may lower the equilibrium vapour pressure according to law there are two types of nucleation processes gases preferentially condense onto surfaces of pre existing aerosol particles known as heterogeneous nucleation this process causes the diameter at the mode of particle size distribution to increase with constant number concentration 30 with sufficiently high supersaturation and no suitable surfaces particles may condense in the absence of a pre existing surface known as homogeneous nucleation this results in the addition of very small rapidly growing particles to the particle size distribution 30 activation edit water coats particles in an aerosols making them activated usually in the context of forming a cloud droplet citation needed following the kelvin equation based on the curvature of liquid droplets smaller particles need a higher ambient relative humidity to maintain equilibrium than larger particles do the following formula gives relative humidity at equilibrium r h p s p 0 100 s 100 where p s is the saturation vapor pressure above a particle at equilibrium around a curved liquid droplet p 0 is the saturation vapor pressure flat surface of the same liquid and s is the saturation ratio kelvin equation for saturation vapor pressure above a curved surface is ln p s p 0 2 m r t r p where r p droplet radius surface tension of droplet density of liquid m molar mass t temperature and r molar gas constant solution to the general dynamic equation edit there are no general solutions to the general dynamic equation gde 31 common methods used to solve the general dynamic equation include 32 moment method 33 modal sectional method 34 and quadrature method of moments 35 36 taylor series expansion method of moments 37 38 and monte carlo method 39 generation and applications edit people generate aerosols for various purposes including as test aerosols for calibrating instruments performing research and testing sampling equipment and air filters 40 to deliver deodorants paints and other consumer products in sprays 41 for dispersal and agricultural application of pesticides 42 for medical treatment of respiratory disease 43 and in fuel injection systems and other combustion technology 44 some devices for generating aerosols are 2 aerosol spray atomizer nozzle or nebulizer electrospray electronic cigarette vibrating orifice aerosol generator voag stability of generated aerosol particles edit stability of nanoparticle agglomerates is critical for estimating size distribution of aerosolized particles from nano powders or other sources at nanotechnology workplaces workers can be exposed via inhalation to potentially toxic substances during handling and processing of nanomaterials nanoparticles in the air often form agglomerates due to attractive inter particle forces such as van der waals force or electrostatic force if the particles are charged as a result aerosol particles are usually observed as agglomerates rather than individual particles for exposure and risk assessments of airborne nanoparticles it is important to know about the size distribution of aerosols when inhaled by humans particles with different diameters are deposited in varied locations of the central and periphery respiratory system particles in nanoscale have been shown to penetrate the air blood barrier in lungs and be translocated into secondary organs in the human body such as the brain heart and liver therefore the knowledge on stability of nanoparticle agglomerates is important for predicting the size of aerosol particles which helps assess the potential risk of them to human bodies different experimental systems have been established to test the stability of airborne particles and their potentials to deagglomerate under various conditions a comprehensive system recently reported by ding riediker 2015 45 is able to maintain robust aerosolization process and generate aerosols with stable number concentration and mean size from nano powders the deagglomeration potential of various airborne nanomaterials can be also studied using critical orifices this process was also investigated by stahlmecke et al 2009 46 in addition an impact fragmentation device was developed to investigate bonding energies between particles 47 a standard deagglomeration testing procedure could be foreseen with the developments of the different types of existing systems the likeliness of deagglomeration of aerosol particles in occupational settings can be possibly ranked for different nanomaterials if a reference method is available for this purpose inter laboratory comparison of testing results from different setups could be launched in order to explore the influences of system characteristics on properties of generated nanomaterials aerosols detection edit aerosol can either be measured in situ or with remote sensing techniques in situ observations edit some available in situ measurement techniques include aerosol mass spectrometer ams differential mobility analyzer dma electrical aerosol spectrometer eas aerodynamic particle sizer aps aerodynamic aerosol classifier aac wide range particle spectrometer wps micro orifice uniform deposit impactor moudi condensation particle counter cpc epiphaniometer electrical low pressure impactor elpi aerosol particle mass analyser apm centrifugal particle mass analyser cpma remote sensing approach edit remote sensing approaches include sun photometer lidar imaging spectroscopy size selective sampling edit particles can deposit in the nose mouth pharynx and larynx the head airways region deeper within the respiratory tract from the trachea to the terminal bronchioles or in the alveolar region 48 the location of deposition of aerosol particles within the respiratory system strongly determines the health effects of exposure to such aerosols 49 this phenomenon led people to invent aerosol samplers that select a subset of the aerosol particles that reach certain parts of the respiratory system 50 examples of these subsets of the particle size distribution of an aerosol important in occupational health include the inhalable thoracic and respirable fractions the fraction that can enter each part of the respiratory system depends on the deposition of particles in the upper parts of the airway 51 the inhalable fraction of particles defined as the proportion of particles originally in the air that can enter the nose or mouth depends on external wind speed and direction and on the particle size distribution by aerodynamic diameter 52 the thoracic fraction is the proportion of the particles in ambient aerosol that can reach the thorax or chest region 53 the respirable fraction is the proportion of particles in the air that can reach the alveolar region 54 to measure the respirable fraction of particles in air a pre collector is used with a sampling filter the pre collector excludes particles as the airways remove particles from inhaled air the sampling filter collects the particles for measurement it is common to use cyclonic separation for the pre collector but other techniques include impactors horizontal elutriators and large pore membrane filters 55 two alternative size selective criteria often used in atmospheric monitoring are pm 10 and pm 2.5 pm 10 is defined by iso as particles which pass through a size selective inlet with a 50% efficiency cut off at 10 aerodynamic diameter and pm 2.5 as particles which pass through a size selective inlet with a 50% efficiency cut off at 2.5 aerodynamic diameter pm 10 corresponds to the as defined in iso 7708 1995 clause 6 pm 2.5 corresponds to the respirable as defined in iso 7708 1995 7.1 56 the united states environmental protection agency replaced the older standards for particulate matter based on total suspended particulate with another standard based on pm 10 in 1987 57 and then introduced standards for pm 2.5 also known as fine particulate matter in 1997 58 atmospheric edit aerosol pollution over northern india and bangladesh main article atmospheric particulate matter several types of atmospheric aerosol have a significant effect on climate volcanic desert dust sea salt that originating from biogenic sources and human made volcanic aerosol forms in the stratosphere after an eruption as droplets of sulfuric acid that can prevail for up to two years and reflect sunlight lowering temperature desert dust mineral particles blown to high altitudes absorb heat and may be responsible for inhibiting storm cloud formation human made sulfate aerosols primarily from burning oil and coal affect the behavior of clouds 59 although all hydrometeors solid and liquid can be described as aerosols a distinction is commonly made between such dispersions i e clouds containing activated drops and crystals and aerosol particles the atmosphere of earth contains aerosols of various types and concentrations including quantities of natural inorganic materials fine dust sea salt or water droplets natural organic materials smoke pollen spores or bacteria anthropogenic products of combustion such as smoke ashes or dusts aerosols can be found in urban ecosystems in various forms for example dust cigarette smoke mist from aerosol spray cans soot or fumes in car exhaust the presence of aerosols in the atmosphere can influence its climate as well as human health effects edit volcanic eruptions release large amounts of sulphuric acid hydrogen sulphide and hydrochloric acid into the atmosphere these gases represent aerosols and eventually return to earth as acid rain having a number of adverse effects on the environment and human life 60 aerosols interact with the energy budget in two ways directly and indirectly e g a direct effect is that aerosols scatter sunlight directly back into space this can lead to a significant decrease in the temperature being an additional element to the greenhouse effect and therefore contributing to the global climate change 61 the indirect effects refer to the aerosols interfering with formations that interact directly with radiation for example they are able to modify the size of the cloud particles in the lower atmosphere thereby changing the way clouds reflect and absorb light and therefore modifying the energy budget 60 when aerosols absorb pollutants it facilitates the deposition of pollutants to the surface of the earth as well as to bodies of water 61 this has the potential to be damaging to both the environment and human health aerosol particles with an effective diameter smaller than 10 can enter the bronchi while the ones with an effective diameter smaller than 2.5 can enter as far as the gas exchange region in the lungs 62 which can be hazardous to human health see also edit wikimedia commons has media related to aerosols nebulizer
