bar unit wikipedia bar unit from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search this article is about the unit of pressure for other uses see bar disambiguation for the informal unit of signal strength see mobile phone signal kbar redirects here for the knife see ka bar bar a pressure of flattened this length of aluminium tubing which had a wall thickness of 5 millimetres unit information unit system metric system pressure symbol bar unit conversions 1 bar in is equal to si units 100 kpa cgs units 1.0 10 6 ba us customary units 14.50377 psi the bar is a metric unit of pressure but is not approved as part of the international system of units si it is defined as exactly equal to 100,000 pa which is slightly less than the current average atmospheric pressure on earth at sea level 1 2 the bar and the millibar were introduced by the norwegian meteorologist vilhelm bjerknes who was a founder of the modern practice of weather forecasting 3 use of the bar is deprecated by professional bodies in some fields the international bureau of weights and measures bipm lists the bar as one of the non si units that authors should have the freedom to use but declines to include it among the non si units accepted for use with the si 1 the us national institute of standards and technology nist deprecates its use except for limited use in meteorology and lists it as one of several units that must not be introduced in fields where they are not presently used 4 the international astronomical union iau also lists it under non si units and symbols whose continued use is deprecated 5 as of 2004 the bar is legally recognized in countries of the european union 2 units derived from the bar include the megabar symbol mbar kilobar symbol kbar decibar symbol dbar centibar symbol cbar and millibar symbol mbar or mb the notation bar g though deprecated by various bodies 2 represents gauge pressure i e pressure in bars above ambient or atmospheric pressure contents 1 definition and conversion 2 origin 3 usage 4 see also 5 references 6 external links definition and conversion edit the bar is defined using the si derived unit pascal 100,000 pa 100,000 n m 2 thus is equal to 1,000,000 ba barye in cgs units and 1 bar is approximately equal to 0.987 atm 14.5038 psi absolute 29.53 inhg 750.06 mmhg 750.06 torr 1019.72 centimetres of water cmh 2 o notes 1 millibar mbar 1 one thousandth bar or 1 10 bar 1 millibar 1 hectopascal 1 hpa 100 pa origin edit the word bar has its origin in the greek word baros meaning weight the official symbol is bar the earlier symbol b is now deprecated and conflicts with the use of b denoting the unit barn but it is still encountered especially as mb rather than the proper mbar to denote the millibar between 1793 and 1795 the word bar was used for a unit of weight in an early version of the metric system 6 usage edit atmospheric air pressure is often given in millibars where standard atmospheric pressure at sea level is defined as 1013.25 mbar 101.325 kpa which is about 14.7 pounds per square inch despite the millibar not being an si unit meteorologists and weather reporters worldwide have long measured air pressure in millibars as the values are convenient after the advent of si units some meteorologists began using hectopascals symbol hpa which are numerically equivalent to millibars for the same reason the hectopascal is now the standard unit used to express barometric pressures in aviation in most countries for example the weather office of environment canada uses kilopascals and hectopascals on their weather maps 7 8 in contrast americans are familiar with the use of the millibar in us reports of hurricanes and other cyclonic storms citation needed in fresh water there is an approximate numerical equivalence between the change in pressure in decibars and the change in depth from the water surface in metres specifically an increase of 1 decibar occurs for every increase in depth in sea water with respect to the gravity variation the latitude and the geopotential anomaly the pressure can be converted into meters depth according to an empirical formula unesco tech paper 44 9 as a result decibars are commonly used in oceanography many engineers worldwide use the bar as a unit of pressure because in much of their work using pascals would involve using very large numbers engineers that specialize in technical safety for offshore petrochemical facilities would be expected to exclusively refer to explosion loads in units of bar or bars a bar is a convenient unit of measure for pressures generated by low frequency vapor cloud explosions that are commonly considered as part of accidental loading risk studies a tire pressure gauge displaying bar outside and pounds per square inch inside in the automotive field turbocharger boost is often described in bars outside the usa tire pressure is often specified in bar unicode has characters for mb u 33d4 and bar u 3374 but they exist only for compatibility with legacy asian encodings and are not intended to be used in new documents the kilobar equivalent to is commonly used in geological systems particularly in experimental petrology bar a and bara are sometimes used to indicate absolute pressures and bar g and barg for gauge pressures this usage is deprecated and fuller descriptions such as gauge pressure of 2 bar or 2 bar gauge are recommended 2 10 see also edit centimetre of water conversion of units metric prefix orders of magnitude pressure references edit this article incorporates material from the citizendium
