macos type presentation program license proprietary commercial software microsoft powerpoint is a presentation program 4 created by robert gaskins and dennis austin 4 at a software company named forethought inc 4 it was released on april 20 1987 5 initially for macintosh computers only 4 microsoft acquired powerpoint for three months after it appeared 6 this was first significant acquisition 7 and microsoft set up a new business unit for powerpoint in silicon valley where forethought had been located 7 powerpoint became a component of the microsoft office suite first offered in 1989 for macintosh 8 and in 1990 for windows 9 which bundled several microsoft apps beginning with powerpoint 4.0 1994 powerpoint was integrated into microsoft office development and adopted shared common components and a converged user interface 10 market share was very small at first prior to introducing a version for microsoft windows but grew rapidly with the growth of windows and of office 11 since the late 1990s worldwide market share of presentation software has been estimated at 95 percent 12 powerpoint was originally designed to provide visuals for group presentations within business organizations but has come to be very widely used in many other communication situations both in business and beyond 13 the impact of this much wider use of powerpoint has been experienced as a powerful change throughout society 14 with strong reactions including advice that it should be used less 15 should be used differently 16 or should be used better 17 the first powerpoint version macintosh 1987 was used to produce overhead transparencies 18 the second macintosh 1988 windows 1990 could also produce color 35mm slides 18 the third version windows and macintosh 1992 introduced video output of virtual slideshows to digital projectors which would over time completely replace physical transparencies and slides 18 a dozen major versions since then have added many additional features and modes of operation 10 and have made powerpoint available beyond apple macintosh and microsoft windows adding versions for ios android and web access 19 contents 1 history 1.1 creation at

valley named forethought inc 20 forethought had been founded in 1983 to create an integrated environment and applications for future personal computers that would provide a graphical user interface but it had run into difficulties requiring a restart and new plan 21 on july 5 1984 forethought hired robert gaskins as its vice president of product development 22 p51 to create a new application that would be especially suited to the new graphical personal computers such as microsoft windows and apple macintosh 23 gaskins produced his initial description of powerpoint about a month later august 14 1984 in the form of a 2 page document titled presentation graphics for overhead projection 24 by october 1984 gaskins had selected dennis austin to be the developer for powerpoint 25 gaskins and austin worked together on the definition and design of the new product for nearly a year and produced the first specification document dated august 21 1985 26 this first design document showed a product as it would look in microsoft windows 1.0 27 which at that time had not been released 28 development from that spec was begun by austin in november 1985 for macintosh first 22 p104 about six months later on may 1 1986 gaskins and austin chose a second developer to join the project thomas rudkin 22 p149 gaskins prepared two final product specification marketing documents in june 1986 these described a product for both macintosh and windows 29 30 at about the same time austin rudkin and gaskins produced a second and final major design specification document this time showing a macintosh look 31 throughout this development period the product was called presenter then just before release there was a last minute check with lawyers to register the name as a trademark and presenter was unexpectedly rejected because it had already been used by someone else gaskins says that he thought of powerpoint based on the goal of empowering individual presenters and sent that name to the lawyers for clearance while all the documentation was hastily revised 32 funding to complete development of powerpoint was assured in mid january 1987 when a new apple computer venture capital fund called strategic investment group 33 selected powerpoint to be its first investment 22 a month later on february 22 1987 forethought announced powerpoint at the personal computer forum in phoenix john sculley the ceo of apple appeared at the announcement and said we see desktop presentation as potentially a bigger market for apple than desktop publishing 34 powerpoint 1.0 for macintosh shipped from manufacturing on april 20 1987 and the first production run of 10,000 units was sold out 35 acquisition by microsoft edit by early 1987 microsoft was starting to plan a new application to create presentations an activity led by jeff raikes who was head of marketing for the applications division 36 microsoft assigned an internal group to write a specification and plan for a new presentation product 37 they contemplated an acquisition to speed up development and in early 1987 microsoft sent a letter of intent to acquire dave winer s product called more an outlining program that could print its outlines as bullet charts 38 during this preparatory activity raikes discovered that a program specifically to make overhead presentations was already being developed by forethought inc and that it was nearly completed 36 raikes and others visited forethought on february 6 1987 for a confidential demonstration 22 p173 raikes later recounted his reaction to seeing powerpoint and his report about it to bill gates who was initially skeptical 36 i thought software to do a great idea i came back to see bill i said bill i think we really ought to do this and bill said no no no no no just a feature of microsoft word just put it into word and i kept saying bill no not just a feature of microsoft word a whole genre of how people do these presentations and to his credit he listened to me and ultimately allowed me to go forward and buy this company in silicon valley called forethought for the product known as powerpoint when powerpoint was released by forethought its initial press was favorable the wall street journal reported on early reactions i see about one product a year i get this excited about says amy wohl a consultant in bala cynwyd pa people will buy a macintosh just to get access to this product 39 on april 28 1987 a week after shipment a group of senior executives spent another day at forethought to hear about initial powerpoint sales on macintosh and plans for windows 22 p191 the following day microsoft sent a letter to dave winer withdrawing its earlier letter of intent to acquire his company 40 and in mid may 1987 microsoft sent a letter of intent to acquire forethought 41 as requested in that letter of intent robert gaskins from forethought went to redmond for a one on one meeting with bill gates in early june 1987 22 p197 and by the end of july an agreement was concluded for an acquisition the new york times reported 42 july the microsoft corporation announced its first significant software acquisition today paying in present day terms 43 for forethought inc of sunnyvale calif forethought makes a program called powerpoint that allows users of apple macintosh computers to make overhead transparencies or flip charts t he acquisition of forethought is the first significant one for microsoft which is based in redmond wash forethought would remain in sunnyvale giving microsoft a silicon valley presence the unit will be headed by robert gaskins vice president of product development president jon shirley offered motivation for the acquisition we made this deal primarily because of our belief in desktop presentations as a product category forethought was first to market with a product in this category 44 microsoft set up within its applications division an independent graphics business unit to develop and to market powerpoint the first microsoft application group distant from the main redmond location 44 all the powerpoint people from forethought joined microsoft and the new location was headed by robert gaskins with dennis austin and thomas rudkin leading development 45 powerpoint 1.0 for macintosh was modified to indicate the new microsoft ownership and continued to be sold 45 a new powerpoint 2.0 for macintosh adding color 35mm slides appeared by mid 1988 45 and again won good reviews 46 the same powerpoint 2.0 product re developed for windows was shipped two years later in mid 1990 at the same time as windows 3.0 47 much of the color technology was the fruit of a joint development partnership with genigraphics at that time the dominant presentation services company 48 powerpoint 3.0 which was shipped in 1992 for both windows and mac added live video for projectors and monitors with the result that powerpoint was thereafter used for delivering presentations as well as for preparing them this was at first an alternative to overhead transparencies and 35mm slides but over time would come to replace them 49 part of microsoft office since 1993 edit see also history of microsoft office powerpoint had been included in microsoft office from the beginning powerpoint 2.0 for macintosh was part of the first office bundle for macintosh which was offered in mid 1989 50 when powerpoint 2.0 for windows appeared a year later it was part of a similar office bundle for windows which was offered in late 1990 51 both of these were bundling promotions in which the independent applications were packaged together and offered for a lower total price 50 51 powerpoint 3.0 1992 was again separately specified and developed 52 and was prominently advertised and sold separately from office 53 it was as before included in microsoft office 3.0 both for windows and the corresponding version for macintosh 54 a plan to integrate the applications themselves more tightly had been indicated as early as february 1991 toward the end of powerpoint 3.0 development in an internal memo by bill gates 55 another important question is what portion of our applications sales over time will be a set of applications versus a single product please assume that we stay ahead in integrating our family together in evaluating our future product teams will deliver on this i believe that we should position the office as our most important application the move from bundling separate products to integrated development began with powerpoint 4.0 developed in under new management from redmond 56 the powerpoint group in silicon valley was reorganized from the independent graphics business unit gbu to become the graphics product unit gpu for office and powerpoint 4.0 changed to adopt a converged user interface and other components shared with the other apps in office 52 when it was released the computer press reported on the change approvingly powerpoint 4.0 has been re engineered from the ground up to resemble and work with the latest applications in office word 6.0 excel 5.0 and access 2.0 the integration is so good have to look twice to make sure running powerpoint and not word or excel 57 office integration was further underscored in the following version powerpoint 95 which was given the version number powerpoint 7.0 skipping 5.0 and 6.0 so that all the components of office would share the same major version number 58 although powerpoint by this point had become part of the integrated microsoft office product its development remained in silicon valley succeeding versions of powerpoint introduced important changes particularly version 12.0 2007 which had a very different shared office ribbon user interface and a new shared office xml based file format 59 this marked the 20th anniversary of powerpoint and microsoft held an event to commemorate that anniversary at its silicon valley campus for the powerpoint team there special guests were robert gaskins dennis austin and thomas rudkin and the featured speaker was jeff raikes all from powerpoint 1.0 days 20 years before 60 since then major development of powerpoint as part of office has continued new development techniques 61 shared across office for powerpoint 2016 have made it possible to ship versions of powerpoint 2016 for windows mac ios android and web access nearly simultaneously 19 and to release new features on a nearly monthly schedule 62 powerpoint development is still located in silicon valley as of 2017 update 63 in 2010 jeff raikes who had most recently been president of the business division of microsoft including responsibility for office 64 observed of course today we know that powerpoint is often times the number in some cases even the number tool among the applications in office 36 sales and market share edit initial sales were about 40,000 copies sold in 1987 nine months about 85,000 copies in 1988 and about 100,000 copies in 1989 all for macintosh 65 market share in its first three years was a tiny part of the total presentation market which was very heavily dominated by ms dos applications on pcs 66 the market leaders on ms dos in 1988-1989 67 were harvard graphics introduced by software publishing in 1986 68 in first place and lotus freelance plus also introduced in 1986 69 as a strong second 70 they were competing with more than a dozen other ms dos presentation products 71 and microsoft did not develop a powerpoint version for ms dos 72 after three years powerpoint sales were disappointing jeff raikes who had bought powerpoint for microsoft later recalled by 1990 it looked like it a very smart idea for microsoft to have acquired powerpoint because not very many people were using powerpoint 36 this began to change when the first version for windows powerpoint 2.0 brought sales up to about 200,000 copies in 1990 and to about 375,000 copies in 1991 with windows units outselling macintosh 65 p403 powerpoint sold about copies in 1992 of which about 80 percent were for windows and about 20 percent for macintosh 65 p403 and in 1992 market share of worldwide presentation graphics software sales was reported as 63 percent 65 p404 by the last six months of 1992 powerpoint revenue was running at a rate of over annually in present day terms 43 65 p405 73 sales of powerpoint 3.0 doubled to about copies in 1993 of which about 90 percent were for windows and about 10 percent for macintosh 65 p403 and in 1993 market share of worldwide presentation graphics software sales was reported as 78 percent 65 p404 in both years about half of total revenue came from sales outside the u s 65 p404 by 1997 powerpoint sales had doubled again to more than copies annually representing 85 percent of the world market 74 also in 1997 an internal publication from the powerpoint group said that by then over copies of powerpoint were in use and that total revenues from powerpoint over its first ten years 1987 to 1996 had already exceeded 75 since the late 1990s market share of total world presentation software has been estimated at 95 percent by both industry and academic sources 76 operation edit the earliest version of powerpoint 1987 for macintosh could be used to print black and white pages to be photocopied onto sheets of transparent film for projection from overhead projectors and to print notes and audience handouts the next version 1988 for macintosh 1990 for windows was extended to also produce color 35mm slides by communicating a file over a modem to a genigraphics imaging center with slides returned by overnight delivery for projection from slide projectors powerpoint was used for planning and preparing a presentation but not for delivering it apart from previewing it on a computer screen or distributing printed paper copies 77 the operation of powerpoint changed substantially in its third version 1992 for windows and macintosh when powerpoint was extended to also deliver a presentation by producing direct video output to digital projectors or large monitors 77 in 1992 video projection of presentations was rare and expensive and practically unknown from a laptop computer robert gaskins one of the creators of powerpoint says he publicly demonstrated that use for the first time at a large microsoft meeting held in paris on february 25 1992 by using an unreleased development build of powerpoint 3.0 running on an early pre production sample of a powerful new color laptop and feeding a professional auditorium video projector 78 by about 2003 ten years later digital projection had become the dominant mode of use replacing transparencies and 35mm slides and their projectors 78 79 as a result the meaning of powerpoint presentation narrowed to mean specifically digital projection 80 in the business lexicon powerpoint presentation had come to refer to a presentation made using a powerpoint slideshow projected from a computer although the powerpoint software had been used to generate transparencies for over a decade this usage was not typically encompassed by common understanding of the term in contemporary operation powerpoint is used to create a file called a presentation or deck 81 containing a sequence of pages called slides in the app which usually have a consistent style from template masters and which may contain information imported from other apps or created in powerpoint including text bullet lists tables charts drawn shapes images audio clips video clips animations of elements and animated transitions between slides plus attached notes for each slide 82 after such a file is created typical operation is to present it as a slide show using a portable computer where the presentation file is stored on the computer or available from a network and the screen shows a presenter view with current slide next slide notes for the current slide and other information 83 video is sent from the computer to one or more external digital projectors or monitors showing only the current slide to the audience with sequencing controlled by the speaker at the computer a smartphone remote control built in to powerpoint for ios optionally controlled from apple watch 84 and for android 85 allows the presenter to control the show from elsewhere in the room in addition to a computer slide show projected to a live audience by a speaker powerpoint can be used to deliver a presentation in a number of other ways displayed on the screen of the presentation computer or tablet for a very small group 86 printed for distribution as paper documents in several formats 87 distributed as files for private viewing even on computers without powerpoint 88 packaged for distribution on cd or a network including linked and embedded data 89 transmitted as a live broadcast presentation over the web 90 embeded in a web page or blog 91 shared on social networks such as facebook or twitter 92 set up as a self running unattended display 93 recorded as video audio h 264 aac to be distributed as for any other video 94 some of these ways of using powerpoint have been studied by joanne yates and wanda orlikowski of the mit sloan school of management 80 the standard form of such presentations involves a single person standing before a group of people talking and using the powerpoint slideshow to project visual aids onto a screen in practice however presentations are not always delivered in this mode in our studies we often found that the presenter sat at a table with a small group of people and walked them through a deck composed of paper copies of the slides in some cases decks were simply distributed to individuals without even a walk through or discussion other variations in form included sending the powerpoint file electronically to another site and talking through the slides over an audio or video channel e g telephone or video conference as both parties viewed the slides another common variation was placing a powerpoint file on a web site for people to view at different times they found that some of these ways of using powerpoint could influence the content of presentations for example when the slides themselves have to carry more of the substance of the presentation and thus need considerably more content than they would have if they were intended for projection by a speaker who would orally provide additional details and nuance about content and context 80 cultural impact edit a powerpoint presentation in progress powerpoint more than most other personal computer applications has been experienced as a powerful force producing change throughout all of society in 2016 an analyst summed up the real mystery is how come almost every organisation in the world is using powerpoint to communicate almost everything to almost everybody the real question how come powerpoint is everywhere 14 business uses edit powerpoint was originally targeted just for business presentations robert gaskins who was responsible for its design has written about his intended customers i did not target other existing large groups of users of presentations such as school teachers or military officers i also did not plan to target people who were not existing users of presentations such as clergy and school children our focus was purely on business users in small and large companies from one person to the largest multinationals 95 business people had for a long time made presentations for sales calls and for internal company communications and powerpoint produced the same formats in the same style and for the same purposes 95 p420 powerpoint use in business grew over its first five years 1987-1992 to sales of about 1 million copies annually for worldwide market share of 63 percent 96 over the following five years 1992-1997 powerpoint sales accelerated to a rate of about 4 million copies annually for worldwide market share of 85 percent 97 the increase in business use has been attributed to network effects whereby additional users of powerpoint in a company or an industry increased its salience and value to other users 98 not everyone immediately approved of the greater use of powerpoint for presentations even in business ceos who very early were reported to discourage or ban powerpoint presentations at internal business meetings included lou gerstner at ibm in 1993 99 scott mcnealy at sun microsystems in 1996 100 and steve jobs at apple in 1997 101 but even so rich gold a scholar who studied corporate presentation use at xerox parc could write in 1999 within corporation if you want to communicate an idea you use powerpoint 102 uses beyond business edit at the same time that powerpoint was becoming dominant in business settings it was also being adopted for uses beyond business personal computing scaled up the production of presentations the result has been the rise of presentation culture in an information society nearly everyone presents 103 in 1998 at about the same time that gold was pronouncing ubiquity in business the influential bell labs engineer robert w lucky could already write about broader uses 104 the world has run amok with the giddy power of presentation graphics a new language is in the air and it is codified in powerpoint in a family discussion about what to do on a given evening for example i feel like pulling out my laptop and giving a vugraph presentation in church i am surprised that the preachers caught on yet how have we gotten on so long without powerpoint over a decade or so beginning in the mid 1990s powerpoint began to be used in many communication situations well beyond its original business presentation uses to include teaching in schools 105 and in universities 106 lecturing in scientific meetings 107 and preparing their related poster sessions 108 worshipping in churches 109 making legal arguments in courtrooms 110 displaying supertitles in theaters 111 driving helmet mounted displays in spacesuits for nasa astronauts 112 giving military briefings 113 issuing governmental reports 114 undertaking diplomatic negotiations 115 116 writing novels 117 giving architectural demonstrations 118 prototyping website designs 119 creating animated video games 120 creating art projects 121 and even as a substitute for writing engineering technical reports 122 and as an organizing tool for writing general business documents 123 by 2003 it seemed that powerpoint was being used everywhere julia keller reported for the chicago tribune 124 powerpoint is one of the most pervasive and ubiquitous technological tools ever concocted in less than a decade it has revolutionized the worlds of business education science and communications swiftly becoming the standard for just about anybody who wants to explain just about anything to just about anybody else from corporate middle managers reporting on production goals to 4th graders fashioning a show and tell on the french and indian war to church pastors explicating the seven deadly sins powerpoint seems poised for world domination cultural reactions edit as uses broadened cultural awareness of powerpoint grew and commentary about it began to appear with the widespread adoption of powerpoint came complaints often very general statements reflecting dissatisfaction with modern media and communication practices as well as the dysfunctions of organizational culture 125 indications of this awaremess included increasing mentions of powerpoint use in the dilbert comic strips of scott adams 126 comic parodies of poor or inappropriate use such as the gettysburg address in powerpoint 127 128 or summaries of hamlet and lolita in powerpoint 129 and a vast number of publications on the general subject of powerpoint especially about how to use it 130 out of all the analyses of powerpoint over a quarter of a century at least three general themes emerged as categories of reaction to its broader use 1 use it less avoid powerpoint in favor of alternatives such as using more complex graphics and written prose or using nothing 15 2 use it differently make a major change to a powerpoint style that is simpler and pictorial turning the presentation toward a performance more like a steve jobs keynote 16 and 3 use it better retain much of the conventional powerpoint style but learn to avoid making many kinds of mistakes that can interfere with communication 17 use it less edit see also edward tufte an early reaction was that the broader use of powerpoint was a mistake and should be reversed an influential example of this came from edward tufte an authority on information design who has been a professor of political science statistics and computer science at princeton and yale but is best known for his self published books on data visualization which have sold nearly copies as of 2014 131 in 2003 he published a widely read booklet titled the cognitive style of powerpoint revised in 2006 15 tufte found a number of problems with the cognitive style of powerpoint many of which he attributed to the standard default style templates 15 convenience for some presenters is costly to the content and the audience these costs arise from the cognitive style characteristics of the standard default pp presentation foreshortening of evidence and thought low spatial resolution an intensely hierarchical single path structure as the model for organizing every type of content breaking up narratives and data into slides and minimal fragments rapid temporal sequencing of thin information rather than focused spatial analysis conspicuous chartjunk and pp phluff branding of slides with logotypes a preoccupation with format not content incompetent designs for data graphics and tables and a smirky commercialism that turns information into a sales pitch and presenters into marketeers italics in original tufte particularly advised against using powerpoint for reporting scientific analyses using as a dramatic example some slides made during the flight of the space shuttle columbia after it had been damaged by an accident at liftoff slides which poorly communicated the engineers limited understanding of what had happened 15 for such technical presentations and for most occasions apart from its initial domain of sales presentations tufte advised against using powerpoint at all in many situations according to tufte it would be better to substitute high resolution graphics or concise prose documents as handouts for the audience to study and discuss providing a great deal more detail 15 many commentators enthusiastically joined in vivid criticism of powerpoint uses 132 and at a conference held in 2013 a decade after booklet appeared one paper claimed that despite all the criticism about his work tufte can be considered as the single most influential author in the discourse on powerpoint while his approach was not rigorous from a research perspective his articles received wide resonance with the public at large 133 there were also others who disagreed with assertion that the powerpoint program reduces the quality of presenters thoughts steven pinker professor of psychology at mit and later harvard had earlier argued that if anything powerpoint if used well would ideally reflect the way we think 134 pinker later reinforced this opinion any general opposition to powerpoint is just dumb like denouncing there were awful powerpoint presentations there were awful scripted lectures unscripted lectures slide shows chalk talks and so on 135 much of the early commentary on all sides was informal and anecdotal because empirical research had been limited 136 use it differently edit see also richard e mayer and steve jobs keynotes a second reaction to powerpoint use was to say that powerpoint can be used well but only by substantially changing its style of use this reaction is exemplified by richard e mayer a professor of psychology at the university of california santa barbara who has studied cognition and learning particularly the design of educational multimedia and who has published more than 500 publications including over 30 books 137 theme has been that in light of the science it is up to us to make a fundamental shift in our can no longer expect people to struggle to try to adapt to our powerpoint habits instead we have to change our powerpoint habits to align with the way people learn 16 tufte had argued his judgment that the information density of text on powerpoint slides was too low perhaps only 40 words on a slide leading to over simplified messages 138 mayer responded that his empirical research showed exactly the opposite that the amount of text on powerpoint slides was usually too high and that even fewer than 40 words on a slide resulted in powerpoint overload that impeded understanding during presentations 139 mayer suggested a few major changes from traditional powerpoint formats 16 replacing brief slide titles with longer headlines expressing complete ideas showing more slides but simpler ones removing almost all text including nearly all bullet lists reserving the text for the spoken narration using larger higher quality and more important graphics and photographs removing all extraneous decoration backgrounds logos and identifications everything but the essential message ideas are claimed by carmine gallo to have been reflected in steve presentations mayer outlined fundamental principles of multimedia design based on what scientists know about cognitive functioning steve slides adhere to each of principles 140 p92 though not unique to jobs many people saw the style for the first time in famous product introductions 141 steve jobs would have been using keynote which was designed for own slide shows beginning in 2003 but gallo says that speaking like jobs has little to do with the type of presentation software you use powerpoint keynote etc all the techniques apply equally to powerpoint and keynote 140 pp14 46 gallo adds that powerpoint has one big advantage over keynote presentation everywhere safe to say that the number of keynote presentations is miniscule in comparison with powerpoint although most presentation designers who are familiar with both formats prefer to work in the more elegant keynote system those same designers will tell you that the majority of their client work is done in powerpoint 140 p44 consistent with its association with steve keynotes a response to this style has been that it is particularly effective for ballroom style presentations as often given in conference center ballrooms where a celebrated and practiced speaker addresses a large passive audience but less appropriate for conference room style presentations which are often recurring internal business meetings for in depth discussion with motivated counterparts 142 use it better edit see also stephen kosslyn a third reaction to powerpoint use was to conclude that the standard style is capable of being used well but that many small points need to be executed carefully to avoid impeding understanding this kind of analysis is particularly associated with stephen kosslyn a cognitive neuroscientist who specializes in the psychology of learning and visual communication and who has been head of the department of psychology at harvard has been director of center for advanced study in the behavioral sciences and has published some 300 papers and 14 books 143 kosslyn presented a set of psychological principles of human perception memory and comprehension that appears to capture the major points of agreement among researchers 144 he reports that his experiments support the idea that that it is not intuitive or obvious how to create effective powerpoint presentations that conform to those agreed principles and that even small differences that might not seem significant to a presenter can produce very different results in audiences understanding for this reason kosslyn says users need specific education to be able to identify best ways to avoid flaws and failures 144 specifically we hypothesized and found that the psychological principles are often violated in powerpoint slideshows across different fields that some types of presentation flaws are noticeable and annoying to audience members and that observers have difficulty identifying many violations in graphical displays in individual slides these studies converge in painting the following picture powerpoint presentations are commonly flawed some types of flaws are more common than others flaws are not isolated to one domain or context and although some types of flaws annoy the audience flaws at the level of slide design are not always obvious to an untrained observer the many flaws and failures identified were those likely to disrupt the comprehension or memory of the material among the most common examples were bulleted items are not presented individually growing the list from the top to the bottom more than four bulleted items appear in a single list more than two lines are used per bulleted sentence and words are not large enough i e greater than 20 point to be easily seen among audience reactions common problems reported were speakers read word for word from notes or from the slides themselves the slides contained too much material to absorb before the next slide was presented and the main point was obscured by lots of irrelevant detail 144 kosslyn observes that these findings could help to explain why the many studies of instructional effectiveness of powerpoint have been inconclusive and conflicting if there were differences in the quality of the presentations tested in different studies that went unobserved because many may feel that good design is intuitively clear 144 in 2007 kosslyn wrote a book about powerpoint in which he suggested a very large number of fairly modest changes to powerpoint styles and gave advice on recommended ways of using powerpoint 17 in a later second book about powerpoint he suggested nearly 150 clarifying style changes in fewer than 150 pages 145 kosslyn summarizes 17 nothing fundamentally wrong with the powerpoint program as a medium rather i claim that the problem lies in how it is used in fact this medium is a remarkably versatile tool that can be extraordinarily effective for many purposes powerpoint presentations are a superior medium of communication which is why they have become standard in so many fields in 2017 an online poll of social media users in the uk was reported to show that powerpoint remains as popular with young tech savvy users as it is with the baby boomers with about four out of five saying that powerpoint was a great tool for making presentations in part because powerpoint with its capacity to be highly visual bridges the wordy world of yesterday with the visual future of tomorrow 146 also in 2017 the managerial communication group of mit sloan school of management polled their incoming mba students finding that results underscore just how differently this generation communicates as compared with older workers 147 fewer than half of respondents reported doing any meaningful longer form writing at work and even that minority mostly did so very infrequently but 85 percent of students named producing presentations as a meaningful part of their job responsibilities two thirds report that they present on a daily or weekly no surprise that in person presentations is the top skill they hope to improve 147 one of the researchers concluded not likely to see future workplaces with long form writing the trend is toward presentations and slides and we see any sign of that slowing down 147 u s military excess edit use of powerpoint by the u s military services began slowly because they were invested in mainframe computers ms dos pcs and specialized military specification graphic output devices all of which powerpoint did not support 148 but because of the strong military tradition of presenting briefings as soon as they acquired the computers needed to run it powerpoint became part of the u s military 149 by 2000 ten years after powerpoint for windows appeared it was already identified as an important feature of u s armed forces culture in a front page story in the wall street journal 150 old fashioned slide briefings designed to update generals on troop movements have been a staple of the military since world war ii but in only a few short years powerpoint has altered the landscape just as word processing made it easier to produce long meandering memos the spread of powerpoint has unleashed a blizzard of jazzy but often incoherent visuals instead of drawing up a dozen slides on a legal pad and running them over to the graphics department captains and colonels now can create hundreds of slides in a few hours without ever leaving their desks if the spirit moves them they can build in gunfire sound effects and images that explode like land mines powerpoint has become such an ingrained part of the defense culture that it has seeped into the military lexicon powerpoint ranger is a derogatory term for a desk bound bureaucrat more adept at making slides than tossing grenades u s military use of powerpoint may have influenced its use by armed forces of other countries foreign armed services also are beginning to get in on the act you speak with the u s military without knowing powerpoint says margaret hayes an instructor at national defense university in washington d c who teaches latin american military officers how to use the software 150 after another 10 years in 2010 and again on its front page the new york times reported that powerpoint use in the military was then a military tool that has spun out of control 151 like an insurgency powerpoint has crept into the daily lives of military commanders and reached the level of near obsession the amount of time expended on powerpoint the microsoft presentation program of computer generated charts graphs and bullet points has made it a running joke in the pentagon and in iraq and afghanistan commanders say that behind all the powerpoint jokes are serious concerns that the program stifles discussion critical thinking and thoughtful decision making not least it ties up junior officers in the daily preparation of slides be it for a joint staff meeting in washington or for a platoon pre mission combat briefing in a remote pocket of afghanistan the new york times account went on to say that as a result some u s generals had banned the use of powerpoint in their operations 151 powerpoint makes us stupid gen james n mattis of the marine corps the joint forces commander said this month at a military conference in north carolina he spoke without powerpoint brig gen h r mcmaster who banned powerpoint presentations when he led the successful effort to secure the northern iraqi city of tal afar in 2005 followed up at the same conference by likening powerpoint to an internal threat dangerous because it can create the illusion of understanding and the illusion of control general mcmaster said in a telephone interview afterward some problems in the world are not bullet izable several incidents about the same time gave wide currency to discussions by serving military officers describing excessive powerpoint use and the organizational culture that encouraged it 152 153 154 in response to the new york times story peter norvig and stephen m kosslyn sent a joint letter to the editor stressing the institutional culture of the military many military personnel bemoan the overuse and misuse of powerpoint the problem is not in the tool itself but in the way that people use is partly a result of how institutions promote misuse 155 the two generals who had been mentioned in 2010 as opposing the institutional culture of excessive powerpoint use were both in the news again in 2017 when james n mattis became u s secretary of defense 156 and h r mcmaster was appointed as u s national security advisor 157 artistic medium edit musician david byrne has been using powerpoint as a medium for art for years producing a book and dvd and showing at galleries his powerpoint based artwork 121 byrne has written i have been working with powerpoint the ubiquitous presentation software as an art medium for a number of years it started off as a joke this software is a symbol of corporate salesmanship or lack thereof but then the work took on a life of its own as i realized i could create pieces that were moving despite the limitations of the medium 158 in 2005 byrne toured with a theater piece styled as a powerpoint presentation when he presented it in berkeley on march 8 2005 the university of california news service reported byrne also defended its appeal as more than just a business a medium for art and theater his talk was titled i powerpoint berkeley alumnus bob gaskins and dennis austin were in the audience eventually byrne said powerpoint could be the foundation for presentational theater with roots in brechtian drama and asian puppet theater 159 after that performance byrne described it in his own online journal did the powerpoint talk in berkeley for an audience of it legends and academics i was terrified the guys that originally turned powerpoint into a program were there what were they gonna think gaskins did tell me afterwards that he liked the powerpoint as theater idea which was a relief 160 the expressions powerpoint art or pptart are used to define a contemporary italian artistic movement which believes that the corporate world can be a unique and exceptional source of inspiration for the artist 161 162 they say the pptart name refers to powerpoint the symbolic and abstract language developed by the corporate world which has become a universal and highly symbolic communication system beyond cultures and borders 163 the wide use of powerpoint had by 2010 given rise to a subculture of powerpoint enthusiasts that is teaching the old application new tricks and may even be turning a dry presentation format into a full fledged artistic medium 164 by using powerpoint animation to create games artworks anime and movies 165 powerpoint viewer edit powerpoint viewer is the name for a series of small free application programs to be used on computers without powerpoint installed to view project or print but not create or edit presentations 166 the first version was introduced with powerpoint 3.0 in 1992 to enable electronic presentations to be projected using conference room computers and to be freely distributed on windows it took advantage of the new feature of embedding truetype fonts within powerpoint presentation files to make such distribution easier 167 the same kind of viewer app was shipped with powerpoint 3.0 for macintosh also in 1992 168 beginning with powerpoint 2003 a feature called package for cd automatically managed all linked video and audio files plus needed fonts when exporting a presentation to a disk or flash drive or network location 169 and also included a copy of a revised powerpoint viewer application so that the result could be presented on other pcs without installing anything 170 the latest version that runs on windows was created in conjunction with powerpoint 2010 but it can also be used to view newer presentations created in powerpoint 2013 and powerpoint 2016 all transitions videos and effects appear and behave the same when viewed using powerpoint viewer as they do when viewed in powerpoint 2010 it supports presentations created using powerpoint 97 and later 166 the latest version that runs on macintosh is powerpoint 98 viewer for the classic mac os and classic environment for macs supporting system 7.5 to mac os x tiger 10.4 171 it can open presentations only from powerpoint 3.0 4.0 and 8.0 powerpoint 98 although presentations created on mac can be opened in powerpoint viewer on windows 172 as of 2017 update the latest versions of powerpoint viewer for windows 2010 173 and for macintosh 1998 174 remain available for download since powerpoint 2013 the recommended replacement for powerpoint viewer has been to use any computer with a browser and network access to display any accessible powerpoint presentation by using the free web app powerpoint

edit early versions of powerpoint from 1987 through 1995 versions 1.0 through 7.0 evolved through a sequence of binary file formats different in each version as functionality was added 250 that resulted in a stable binary format called a ppt file like all earlier binary formats that was shared as the default in powerpoint 97 through powerpoint 2003 for windows and in powerpoint 98 through powerpoint 2004 for mac that is in powerpoint versions 8.0 through 11.0 251 252 the specification document is actively maintained and can be freely downloaded 251 because although no longer the default that binary format can be read and written by some later versions of powerpoint including the current powerpoint 2016 247 after the stable binary format was adopted versions of powerpoint continued to be able to read and write differing file formats from earlier versions 250 but beginning with powerpoint 2007 and powerpoint 2008 for mac powerpoint version 12.0 this was the only binary

standardization process was contentious 258 it was approved as iso iec 29500 in early 2008 259 copies of the iso iec standard specification are freely available in two parts 260 261 these define two related standards known as transitional and strict the two standards were progressively adopted by powerpoint powerpoint version 12.0 2007 2008 for mac could read and write transitional format but could neither read nor write strict format powerpoint version 14.0 2010 2011 for mac could read and write transitional and also read but not write strict powerpoint version 15.0 and later beginning 2013 2016 for mac can read and write both transitional and strict formats the reason for the two variants was explained by microsoft 262 the participants in the iso iec standardization process recognized two objectives with competing requirements the first objective was for the open xml standard to provide an xml based file format that could fully support conversion of the billions of existing office documents without any loss of features content text layout or other information including embedded data the second was to specify a file format that did not rely on microsoft specific data types they created two variants of open which supports previously defined microsoft specific data types and strict which does not rely on them prior versions of office that is 2007 have supported
