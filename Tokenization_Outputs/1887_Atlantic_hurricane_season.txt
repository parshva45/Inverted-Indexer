by the seasons of 1933 and the record breaking 2005 the 1887 season saw tropical activity as early as may and as late as december tropical cyclones that did not approach populated areas or shipping lanes especially if they were relatively weak and of short duration may have remained undetected because technologies such as satellite monitoring were not available until the 1960s historical data on tropical cyclones from this period may not be comprehensive an undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910 has been estimated 1 of the known 1887 cyclones tropical storm one and tropical storm three were first documented in 1996 by jose fernandez partagas and henry diaz they also proposed large alterations to the
