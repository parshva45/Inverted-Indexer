international space station launch date september 14 2001 launch vehicle soyuz u progress m so1 docked september 16 2001 undocked tba 2017 planned reentry tba 2017 planned mass 3,580 kg length 4.91 m diameter 2.55 m living volume 13 cubic metres pirs russian meaning pier also called stykovochny otsek 1 or so 1 russian docking module or dc 1 docking compartment is one of the two russian docking compartments originally planned for the iss pirs was launched in august 2001 it provides the iss with one docking port for soyuz and progress spacecraft and allows egress and ingress for spacewalks by cosmonauts using russian orlan space suits a second docking compartment stykovochniy otsek 2 or so 2 was initially planned with the same design however when the russian segment of the iss was redesigned in 2001 the new design no longer included the so 2 and its construction was canceled 1 after another change of plans the so 2 module finally evolved into the poisk module which was added to the iss in 2009 pirs was scheduled to be detached from the iss and deorbited in 2017 by progress ms 06 to make room for the russian multipurpose laboratory module nauka however due to the repetitive delays with the module this maneuver was postponed for progress ms 09 in 2018 contents 1 design and construction 2 launch in 2001 3 future 4 airlock specifications 5 gallery 5.1 outside 5.2 inside 6

and has his back to the soyuz spacecraft zarya is seen to the left and zvezda across the bottom of the image the docking compartment has two primary functions provide a docking port and serve as an airlock the docking port can accommodate one soyuz tma or one progress m spacecraft visiting spacecraft can deliver people and cargo to and from to the space station in addition the docking compartment can transport fuel from the fuel tanks of a docked progress resupply vehicle to either the zvezda service module integrated propulsion system or the zarya functional cargo block it can also transfer propellant from zvezda and zarya to the propulsion system of docked and progress the two airlocks are used for spacewalks by cosmonauts wearing russian orlan m spacesuits the pirs docking compartment was manufactured by rkk energia the docking compartment is similar to the mir docking module used on the mir space station the docking planned lifetime as part of the station was five years launch in 2001 edit pirs was launched on september 14 2001 as iss assembly mission 4r on a russian soyuz u rocket using a modified progress spacecraft progress m so1 as an upper stage the 3 580 kilogram pirs docking compartment is attached to the nadir bottom earth facing port of the zvezda service module it docked to the international space station on september 16 2001 and was configured during three spacewalks by the expedition 3 crew two strela cargo cranes were later added by the sts 96 and sts 101 missions carried up on integrated cargo carriers and installed during evas future edit pirs was originally scheduled to be detached from the nadir bottom port of the zvezda module in 2014 2 to make room for the russian multipurpose laboratory module nauka 3 this has been delayed first to 2017 and then to 2018 due to a series of launch failures with the proton rocket leading to delays in the launch of nauka 4 when that happens pirs could become the first permanent iss module to be decommissioned and would be destroyed during atmospheric re entry airlock specifications edit length 4.91 metres diameter 2.55 metres weight 3,580 kilograms volume 13 cubic metres
