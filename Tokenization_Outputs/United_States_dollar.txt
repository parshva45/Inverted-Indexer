at 31 u s c section 5112 prescribes the forms in which the united states dollars should be issued 14 these coins are both designated in section 5112 as legal tender in payment of debts 14 the sacagawea dollar is one example of the copper alloy dollar the pure silver dollar is known as the american silver eagle section 5112 also provides for the minting and issuance of other coins which have values ranging from one cent to 100 dollars 14 these other coins are more fully described in coins of the united states dollar the constitution provides that a regular statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time 15 that provision of the constitution is made specific by section 331 of title 31 of the united states code 16 the sums of money reported in the statements are currently being expressed in u s dollars for example see the 2009 financial report of the united states government 17 the u s dollar may therefore be described as the unit of account of the united states the word dollar is one of the words in the first paragraph of section 9 of article i of the constitution there dollars is a reference to the spanish milled dollar a coin that had a monetary value of 8 spanish units of currency or reales in 1792 the u s congress passed a coinage act section 9 of that act authorized the production of various coins including dollars or to be of the value of a spanish milled dollar as the same is now current and to contain three hundred and seventy one grains and four sixteenth parts of a grain of pure or four hundred and sixteen grains of standard silver section 20 of the act provided that the money of account of the united states shall be expressed in dollars or units and that all accounts in the public offices and all proceedings in the courts of the united states shall be kept and had in conformity to this regulation in other words this act designated the united states dollar as the unit of currency of the united states unlike the spanish milled dollar the u s dollar is based upon a decimal system of values in addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one thousandth of a dollar symbol cent or one hundredth of a dollar symbol dime or one tenth of a dollar and eagle or ten dollars with prescribed weights and composition of gold silver or copper for each it was proposed in the mid 1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist however only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar dime is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of while eagle and mill are largely unknown to the general public though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies and gasoline prices are usually in the form of x xx9 per gallon e g $3.599, more commonly written as $3.59 9 10 when currently issued in circulating form denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as u s coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as federal reserve notes with the exception of gold silver and platinum coins valued up to $100 as legal tender but worth far more as bullion both one dollar coins and notes are produced today although the note form is significantly more common in the past paper money was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar fractional currency and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of $20 known as the double eagle discontinued in the 1930s the term eagle was used in the coinage act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars and subsequently was used in naming gold coins paper currency less than one dollar in denomination known as fractional currency was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as shinplasters in 1854 james guthrie then secretary of the treasury proposed creating $100, $50 and $25 gold coins which were referred to as a union half union and quarter union 18 thus implying a denomination of 1 union $100. series of 1917 $1 united states bill today usd notes are made from cotton fiber paper unlike most common paper which is made of wood fiber u s coins are produced by the united states mint u s dollar banknotes are printed by the bureau of engraving and printing and since 1914 have been issued by the federal reserve the large sized notes issued before 1928 measured 7.42 by 3.125 inches 188.5 by small sized notes introduced that year measure 6.14 by 2.61 by 0.0043 inches 155.96 by 66.29 by when the current smaller sized u s currency was introduced it was referred to as philippine sized currency because the philippines had previously adopted the same size for its legal currency etymology edit further information dollar in the 16th century count hieronymus schlick of bohemia began minting coins known as joachimstalers from german thal or nowadays usually tal valley cognate with dale in english named for joachimstal the valley where the silver was mined st joachim s valley now then part of the kingdom of bohemia now part of the czech republic 19 joachimstaler was later shortened to the german taler a word that eventually found its way into danish and swedish as daler norwegian as dalar and daler dutch as daler or daalder ethiopian as talari hungarian as italian as tallero and english as dollar 19 alternatively thaler is said to come from the german coin guldengroschen great guilder being of silver but equal in value to a gold guilder minted from the silver from joachimsthal the coins minted at joachimsthal soon lent their name to other coins of similar size and weight from other places one such example was a dutch coin depicting a lion hence its dutch name leeuwendaler in english lion dollar the leeuwendaler was authorized to contain 427.16 grains of .75 fine silver and passed locally for between 36 and 42 stuivers it was lighter than the large denomination coins then in circulation thus it was more advantageous for a dutch merchant to pay a foreign debt in leeuwendalers and it became the coin of choice for foreign trade the leeuwendaler was popular in the dutch east indies and in the dutch new netherland colony new york and circulated throughout the thirteen colonies during the 17th and early 18th centuries it was also popular throughout eastern europe where it led to the current romanian and moldovan currency being called leu literally lion among the english speaking community the coin came to be popularly known as lion and is the origin of the name dollar 20 the modern american english pronunciation of dollar is still remarkably close to the 17th century dutch pronunciation of daler 21 by analogy with this lion dollar spanish with the same weight and shape as the lion came to be known as spanish dollars 21 by the mid 18th century the lion dollar had been replaced by the spanish dollar the famous piece of eight which was distributed widely in the spanish colonies in the new world and in the philippines 22 eventually dollar became the name of the first official american currency nicknames edit see also slang terms for money states the colloquialism buck s much like the british word quid s pl for the pound sterling is often used to refer to dollars of various nations including the u s dollar this term dating to the 18th century may have originated with the colonial leather trade it may also have originated from a poker term 23 greenback is another nickname originally applied specifically to the 19th century demand note dollars created by abraham lincoln to finance the costs of the civil war for the north 24 the original note was printed in black and green on the back side it is still used to refer to the u s dollar but not to the dollars of other countries other well known names of the dollar as a whole in denominations include greenmail green and dead presidents the last because deceased presidents are pictured on most bills a grand sometimes shortened to simply g is a common term for the amount of $1,000. the suffix k or k from kilo is also commonly used to denote this amount such as 10k to mean 10 000 however the $1,000 note is no longer in general use a large or stack it is usually a reference to a multiple of $1,000 such as fifty large meaning 50 000 the $100 note is nicknamed benjamin benji ben or franklin after benjamin franklin c note c being the roman numeral for 100 century note or bill e g two bills being 200 the $50 note is occasionally called a yardstick or a grant after president ulysses s grant

also been referred to as a bone and bones in plural e g twenty bones is equal to 20 the newer designs with portraits displayed in the main body of the obverse rather than in cameo insets upon paper color coded by denomination are sometimes referred to as bigface notes or monopoly money piastre was the original french word for the u s dollar used for example in the french text of the louisiana purchase calling the dollar a piastre is still common among the speakers of cajun french and new england french modern french uses dollar for this unit of currency as well the term is still used as slang for u s dollars in the french speaking caribbean islands most notably haiti dollar sign edit main article dollar sign spanish silver real or peso of 1768 the symbol usually written before the numerical amount is used for the u s dollar as well as for many other currencies the sign was the result of a late 18th century evolution of the scribal abbreviation p s for the peso the common name for the spanish dollars that were in wide circulation in the new world from the 16th to the 19th centuries these spanish pesos or dollars were minted in spanish america namely in mexico city bolivia and lima peru the p and the s eventually came to be written over each other giving rise to 25 26 27 28 another popular explanation is that it is derived from the pillars of hercules on the spanish coat of arms of the spanish dollar these pillars of hercules on the silver spanish dollar coins take the form of two vertical bars and a swinging cloth band in the shape of an s yet another explanation suggests that the dollar sign was formed from the capital letters u and s written or printed one on top of the other this theory popularized by novelist ayn rand in atlas shrugged 29 does not consider the fact that the symbol was already in use before the formation of the united states 30 history edit see also history of the united states dollar obverse of rare 1934 $500 federal reserve note featuring a portrait of president william mckinley reverse of a $500 federal reserve note the american dollar coin was initially based on the value and look of the spanish dollar used widely in spanish america from the 16th to the 19th centuries the first dollar coins issued by the united states mint founded 1792 were similar in size and composition to the spanish dollar minted in mexico and peru the spanish u s silver dollars and later mexican silver pesos circulated side by side in the united states and the spanish dollar and mexican peso remained legal tender until the coinage act of 1857 the coinage of various english colonies also circulated the lion dollar was popular in the dutch new netherland colony new york but the lion dollar also circulated throughout the english colonies during the 17th century and early 18th century examples circulating in the colonies were usually worn so that the design was not fully distinguishable thus they were sometimes referred to as dog dollars 31 the u s dollar was first defined by the coinage act of 1792 which specified a dollar to be based in the spanish milled dollar and of 371 grains and 4 sixteenths part of a grain of pure or 416 grains of standard silver and an eagle to be 247 and 4 eighths of a grain or 270 grains of gold again depending on purity 32 the choice of the value 371 grains arose from alexander hamilton s decision to base the new american unit on the average weight of a selection of worn spanish dollars hamilton got the treasury to weigh a sample of spanish dollars and the average weight came out to be 371 grains a new spanish dollar was usually about 377 grains in weight and so the new u s dollar was at a slight discount in relation to the spanish dollar the same coinage act also set the value of an eagle at 10 dollars and the dollar at 1 10 eagle it called for 90% silver alloy coins in denominations of 1 1 2 1 4 1 10 and 1 20 dollars it called for 90% gold alloy coins in denominations of 1 1 2 1 4 and 1 10 eagles the value of gold or silver contained in the dollar was then converted into relative value in the economy for the buying and selling of goods this allowed the value of things to remain fairly constant over time except for the influx and outflux of gold and silver in the economy 33 the early currency of the united states did not exhibit faces of presidents as is the custom now 34 although today by law only the portrait of a deceased individual may appear on united states currency 35 in fact the newly formed government was against having portraits of leaders on the currency a practice compared to the policies of european monarchs 36 the currency as we know it today did not get the faces they currently have until after the early 20th century before that heads side of coinage used profile faces and striding seated and standing figures from greek and roman mythology and composite native americans the last coins to be converted to profiles of historic americans were the dime 1946 and the dollar 1971 for articles on the currencies of the colonies and states see connecticut pound delaware pound georgia pound maryland pound

continental one third dollar bill obverse see also continental currency during the american revolution the thirteen colonies became independent states freed from british monetary regulations they each issued paper money to pay for military expenses the continental congress also began issuing continental currency denominated in spanish dollars the dollar was valued relative to the states currencies

north carolina 32 1 2 shillings south carolina continental currency depreciated badly during the war giving rise to the famous phrase not worth a continental 37 a primary problem was that monetary policy was not coordinated between congress and the states which continued to issue bills of credit additionally neither congress nor the governments of the several states had the will or the means to retire the bills from circulation through taxation or the sale of bonds 38 the currency was ultimately replaced by the silver dollar at the rate of 1 silver dollar to 1000 continental dollars silver and gold standards edit from 1792 when the mint act was passed the dollar was defined as 371.25 grains 24.056 g of silver many historians who erroneously assume gold was standardized at a fixed rate in parity with silver however there is no evidence of congress making this law this has to do with alexander hamilton s suggestion to congress of a fixed 15 1 ratio of silver to gold respectively the gold coins that were minted however were not given any denomination whatsoever and traded for a market value relative to the congressional standard of the silver dollar 1834 saw a shift in the gold standard to 23.2 grains followed by a slight adjustment to 23.22 grains in 1837 16 1 ratio citation needed in 1862 paper money was issued without the backing of precious metals due to the civil war silver and gold coins continued to be issued and in 1878 the link between paper money and coins was reinstated this disconnection from gold and silver backing also occurred during the war of 1812 the use of paper money not backed by precious metals had also occurred under the articles of confederation from 1777 to 1788 with no solid backing and being easily counterfeited the continentals quickly lost their value giving rise to the phrase not worth a continental this was a primary reason for the no state shall make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts clause in article 1 section 10 of the united states constitution in order to finance the war of 1812 congress authorized the issuance of treasury notes interest bearing short term debt that could be used to pay public dues while they were intended to serve as debt they did function to a limited extent as money treasury notes were again printed to help resolve the reduction in public revenues resulting from the panic of 1837 and the panic of 1857 as well as to help finance the war and the civil war in addition to treasury notes in 1861 congress authorized the treasury to borrow $50 million in the form of demand notes which did not bear interest but could be redeemed on demand for precious metals however by december 1861 the union supply of specie was outstripped by demand for redemption and they were forced to suspend redemption temporarily the following february congress passed the legal tender act of 1862 issuing united states notes which were not redeemable on demand and bore no interest but were legal tender meaning that creditors had to accept them at face value for any payment except for public debts and import tariffs however silver and gold coins continued to be issued resulting in the depreciation of the newly printed notes through law in 1869 supreme court ruled in hepburn v griswold that congress could not require creditors to accept united states notes but overturned that ruling the next year in the legal tender cases in 1875 congress passed the specie payment resumption act requiring the treasury to allow us notes to be redeemed for gold after january 1 1879 the treasury ceased to issue united states notes in 1971 the gold standard act of 1900 abandoned the bimetallic standard and defined the dollar as 23.22 grains of gold equivalent to setting the price of 1 troy ounce of gold at $20.67. silver coins continued to be issued for circulation until 1964 when all silver was removed from dimes and quarters and the half dollar was reduced to 40% silver silver half dollars were last issued for circulation in 1970 gold coins were confiscated by executive order 6102 issued in 1933 by franklin roosevelt the gold standard was changed to 13.71 grains equivalent to setting the price of 1 troy ounce of gold at $35. this standard persisted until 1968 between 1968 and 1975 a variety of pegs to gold were put in place eventually culminating in a sudden end on august 15 1971 to the convertibility of dollars to gold later dubbed the nixon shock the last peg was $42.22 per ounce citation needed before the u s dollar was let to freely float on currency markets according to the bureau of engraving and printing the largest note it ever printed was the $100,000 gold certificate series 1934 these notes were printed from december 18 1934 through january 9 1935

replaced with cupronickel however since 1992 the u s mint has produced special silver proof sets in addition to the regular yearly proof sets with silver dimes quarters and half dollars in place of the standard copper nickel versions in addition an experimental $4.00 stella coin was also minted in 1879 but never placed into circulation and is properly considered to be a pattern rather than an actual coin denomination the $50 coin mentioned was only produced in 1915 for the panama pacific international exposition 1915 celebrating the opening of the panama canal only 1,128 were made 645 of which were octagonal this remains the only u s coin that was not round as well as the largest and heaviest u s coin ever produced a $100 gold coin was produced in high relief during 2015 although it was primarily produced for collectors not for general circulation 40 from 1934 to present the only denominations produced for circulation have been the familiar penny nickel dime quarter half dollar and dollar the nickel is the only coin still in use today that is essentially unchanged except in its design from its original version every year since 1866 the nickel has been 75% copper and 25% nickel except for 4 years during world war ii when nickel was needed for the war due to the low value some efforts have been made to eliminate the penny as circulating coinage 41 42 collector coins edit the united states mint produces proof sets specifically for collectors and speculators silver proofs tend to be the standard designs but with the dime quarter and half dollar containing 90% silver starting in 1983 and ending in 1997 the mint also produced proof sets containing the commemorative coins alongside the regular coins another type of proof set is the presidential dollar proof set where four special $1 coins are minted each year featuring a president because of budget constraints and increasing stockpiles of these relatively unpopular coins the production of new presidential dollar coins for circulation was suspended on december 13 2011 by u s treasury secretary timothy f geithner future minting of such coins will be made solely for collectors 43 2007 had

article coins of the united states dollar the first united states dollar was minted in 1794 known as the flowing hair dollar contained 416 grains of standard silver 89 25 silver and 10.75% copper as specified by section 13 44 of the coinage act of 1792 it was designated by section 9 of that act as having the value of a spanish milled dollar dollar coins have not been very popular in the united states 45 silver dollars were minted intermittently from 1794 through 1935 a copper nickel dollar of the same large size featuring president dwight d eisenhower was minted from 1971 through 1978 gold dollars were also minted in the 19th century the susan b anthony dollar coin was introduced in 1979 these proved to be unpopular because they were often mistaken for quarters due to their nearly equal size their milled edge and their similar color minting of these dollars for circulation was suspended in 1980 collectors pieces were struck in 1981 but as with all past u s coins they remain legal tender as the number of anthony dollars held by the federal reserve and dispensed primarily to make change in postal and transit vending machines had been virtually exhausted additional anthony dollars were struck in 1999 in 2000 a new $1 coin featuring sacagawea the sacagawea dollar was introduced which corrected some of the problems of the anthony dollar by having a smooth edge and a gold color without requiring changes to vending machines that accept the anthony dollar however this new coin has failed to achieve the popularity of the still existing $1 bill and is rarely used in daily transactions the failure to simultaneously withdraw the dollar bill and weak publicity efforts have been cited by coin proponents as primary reasons for the failure of the dollar coin to gain popular support 46 in february 2007 the u s mint under the presidential $1 coin act of 2005 47 introduced a new $1 u s presidential dollar coin based on the success of the 50 state quarters series the new coin features a sequence of presidents in order of their inaugurations starting with george washington on the obverse side the reverse side features the statue of liberty to allow for larger more detailed portraits the traditional inscriptions of e pluribus unum in god we trust the year of minting or issuance and the mint mark will be inscribed on the edge of the coin instead of the face this feature similar to the edge inscriptions seen on the british coin is not usually associated with u s coin designs the inscription liberty has been eliminated with the statue of liberty serving as a sufficient replacement in addition due to the nature of u s coins this will be the first time there will be circulating u s coins of different denominations with the same president featured on the obverse heads side lincoln penny jefferson nickel franklin d roosevelt dime washington quarter kennedy half dollar and eisenhower dollar another unusual fact about the new $1 coin is grover cleveland will have two coins with two different portraits issued due to the fact he was the only u s president to be elected to two non consecutive terms 48 early releases of the washington coin included error coins shipped primarily from the philadelphia mint to florida and tennessee banks highly sought after by collectors and trading for as much as $850 each within a week of discovery the error coins were identified by the absence of the edge impressions e pluribus unum in god we trust 2007 p the mint of origin is generally accepted to be mostly philadelphia although identifying the source mint is impossible without opening a mint pack also containing marked units edge lettering is minted in both orientations with respect to heads some amateur collectors were initially duped into buying upside down lettering error coins 49 some cynics also erroneously point out that the federal reserve makes more profit from dollar bills than dollar coins because they wear out in a few years whereas coins are more permanent the fallacy of this argument arises because new notes printed to replace worn out notes which have been withdrawn from circulation bring in no net revenue to the government to offset the costs of printing new notes and destroying the old ones as most vending machines are incapable of making change in banknotes they commonly accept only $1 bills though a few will give change

except for the 2009 ultra high relief double eagle it is now the home of the nevada state museum which still strikes commemorative medallions with the cc mint mark most recently in 2014 commemorating the nevada sesquicentennial using former the original coin press although the mint mark d has been used by two separate mints it is easy to distinguish between the two as any coinage is dahlonega and any 20th or coins are denver during the period in which this mint branch was operational the philippines was an insular territory and then commonwealth of the u s it was the first and to date only u s

constitution provides that congress shall have the power to borrow money on the credit of the united states 50 congress has exercised that power by authorizing federal reserve banks to issue federal reserve notes those notes are obligations of the united states and shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the treasury department of the united states in the city of washington district of columbia or at any federal reserve bank 51 federal reserve notes are designated by law as legal tender for the payment of debts 52 congress has also authorized the issuance of more than 10 other types of banknotes including the united states note 53 and the federal reserve bank note the federal reserve note is the only type that remains in circulation since the 1970s currently printed denominations are $1 $2 $5 $10 $20 $50 and $100 notes above the $100 denomination stopped being printed in 1946 and were officially withdrawn from circulation in 1969 these notes were used primarily in inter bank transactions or by organized crime it was the latter usage that prompted president richard nixon to issue an executive order in 1969 halting their use with the advent of electronic banking they became less necessary notes in denominations of $500, $1,000, $5,000, $10,000, and $100,000 were all produced at one time see large denomination bills in u s currency for details with the exception of the $100,000 bill which was only issued as a series 1934 gold certificate and was never publicly circulated thus it is illegal to own these notes are now collectors items and are worth more than their face value to collectors though still predominantly green post 2004 series incorporate other colors to better distinguish different denominations as a result of a 2008 decision in an accessibility lawsuit filed by the american council of the blind the bureau of engraving and printing is planning to implement a raised tactile feature in the next redesign of each note except the $1 and the current version of the $100 bill it also plans larger higher contrast numerals more color differences and distribution of currency readers to assist the visually impaired during the transition period 54 means of issue edit the monetary base consists of coins and federal reserve notes in circulation outside the federal reserve banks and the u s treasury plus deposits held by depository institutions at federal reserve banks the adjusted monetary base has increased from approximately 400 billion dollars in 1994 to 800 billion in 2005 and over 3000 billion in 2013 55 the amount of cash in circulation is increased or decreased by the actions of the federal reserve system eight times a year the 12 person federal open market committee meets to determine u s monetary policy 56 every business day the federal reserve system engages in open market operations to carry out that monetary policy 57 if the federal reserve desires to increase the money supply it will buy securities such as u s treasury bonds anonymously from banks in exchange for dollars conversely it will sell securities to the banks in exchange for dollars to take dollars out of circulation 58 when the federal reserve makes a purchase it credits the reserve account with the federal reserve this money is not transferred from any existing is at this point that the federal reserve has created new high powered money commercial banks can freely withdraw in cash any excess reserves from their reserve account at the federal reserve to fulfill those requests the federal reserve places an order for printed money from the u s treasury department 59 the treasury department in turn sends these requests to the bureau of engraving and printing to print new dollar bills and the bureau of the mint to stamp the coins usually the short term goal of open market operations is to achieve a specific short term interest rate target in other instances monetary policy might instead entail the targeting of a specific exchange rate relative to some foreign currency or else relative to gold for example in the case of the united states the federal reserve targets the federal funds rate the rate at which member banks lend to one another overnight the other primary means of conducting monetary policy include i discount window lending as lender of last resort ii fractional deposit lending changes in the reserve

the value of domestic and foreign coins congress exercised those powers when it enacted the coinage act of 1792 that act provided for the minting of the first u s dollar and it declared that the u s dollar shall have the value of a spanish milled dollar as the same is now current 60 the table to the right shows the equivalent amount of goods that in a particular year could be purchased with $1. the table shows that from 1774 through 2012 the u s dollar has lost about 97.0% of its buying power 61 the decline in the value of the u s dollar corresponds to price inflation which is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time 62 a consumer price index cpi is a measure estimating the average price of consumer goods and services purchased by households the united states consumer price index published by the bureau of labor statistics is a measure estimating the average price of consumer goods and services in the united states 63 it reflects inflation as experienced by consumers in their day to day living expenses 64 a graph showing the u s cpi relative to and the annual year over year change in cpi is shown at right the value of the u s dollar declined significantly during wartime especially during the american civil war world war i and world war ii 65 the federal reserve which was established in 1913 was designed to furnish an elastic currency subject to substantial changes of quantity over short periods which differed significantly from previous forms of high powered money such as gold national bank notes and silver coins 66 over the very long run the prior gold standard kept prices instance the price level and the value of the u s dollar in 1914 was not very different from the price level in the 1880s the federal reserve initially succeeded in maintaining the value of the u s dollar and price stability reversing the inflation caused by the first world war and stabilizing the value of the dollar during the 1920s before presiding over a 30% deflation in u s prices in the 1930s 67 under the bretton woods system established after world war ii the value of gold was fixed to $35 per ounce and the value of the u s dollar was thus anchored to the value of gold rising government spending in the 1960s however led to doubts about the ability of the united states to maintain this convertibility gold stocks dwindled as banks and international investors began to convert dollars to gold and as a result the value of the dollar began to decline facing an emerging currency crisis and the imminent danger that the united states would no longer be able to redeem dollars for gold gold convertibility was finally terminated in 1971 by president nixon resulting in the nixon shock 68 the value of the u s dollar was therefore no longer anchored to gold and it fell upon the federal reserve to maintain the value of the u s currency the federal reserve however continued to increase the money supply resulting in stagflation and a rapidly declining value of the u s dollar in the 1970s this was largely due to the prevailing economic view at the time that inflation and real economic growth were linked the phillips curve and so inflation was regarded as relatively benign 68 between 1965 and 1981 the u s dollar lost two thirds of its value 61 in 1979 president carter appointed paul volcker chairman of the federal reserve the federal reserve tightened the money supply and inflation was substantially lower in the 1980s and hence the value of the u s dollar stabilized 68 over the thirty year period from 1981 to 2009 the u s dollar lost over half its value 61 this is because the federal reserve has targeted not zero inflation but a low stable rate of 1987 and 1997 the rate of inflation was approximately 3.5 and between 1997 and 2007 it was approximately 2 the so called great moderation of economic conditions since the 1970s is credited to monetary policy targeting price stability 69 there is ongoing debate about whether central banks should target zero inflation which would mean a constant value for the u s dollar over time or low stable inflation which would mean a continuously but slowly declining value of the dollar over time as is the case now although some economists are in favor of a zero inflation policy and therefore a constant value for the u s dollar 67 others contend that such a policy limits the ability of the central bank to control interest rates and stimulate the economy when needed 70 exchange rates edit historical exchange rates edit currency
