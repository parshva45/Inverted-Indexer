westward at approximately with no associated deep convection and a weak low level inverted v curvature 2 3 initially difficult to locate on satellites 4 the wave axis tracked through a moist environment 5 and developed an area of scattered thunderstorms by august 25 visible satellite imagery indicated broad cyclonic turning just north of the intertropical convergence zone 6 the wave continued to develop moderate to strong convection and on august 27 a 1012 mbar hpa 29.88 inhg low pressure area developed about 830 mi 1,340 km west southwest of praia cape verde 7 for the next several days the system failed to organize significantly 8 however on august 30 the wave became better defined with more representation of the cyclonic turning into the low 9 convection increased early the next day 10 and a hurricane hunters flight into the system reported the presence of a closed low level circulation accordingly the national hurricane center initiated advisories on tropical depression six at on august 31 while it was located about east southeast of the southern windward islands 11 upon becoming a tropical cyclone the depression was located to the south of a strong ridge resulting in a west northwest motion the system maintained curved rainbands with expanding outflow and with light wind shear and warm water temperatures the environment favored further development 11 its deep convection consolidated very near the center and shortly after passing over the island of grenada the depression intensified into tropical storm felix early at around on september 1 12 felix quickly strengthened as it developed a small inner core of convection with tightly wound bands around the center 13 and by late on september 1 an eye feature was observed on satellite imagery 14 based on reports from reconnaissance aircraft the national hurricane center estimated that felix attained hurricane status by early on september 2 while located about east northeast of bonaire 15 hurricane felix rapidly intensifying south of hispaniola on september 2 tracking through an area of extremely low wind shear and increasingly high oceanic heat content felix quickly developed a well defined eye a symmetric cloud structure and strong upper level outflow 16 consequently the hurricane commenced explosive intensification shortly afterward felix attained major hurricane status at around on september 2 while located about southeast of kingston jamaica 17 rapid strengthening continued and later that day the hurricane attained status on the saffir simpson hurricane scale with the pressure dropping to hpa this corresponded to a falling rate of hpa per hour which the national hurricane center described as one of the more rapid deepening rates we have observed a hurricane hunters flight reported a stadium effect in the eye and also reported the eye diameter shrank to 18 a subsequent hurricane hunters flight experienced flight level winds of with peak surface winds of reported in the southwest quadrant of the eyewall surface winds of were found in its northeastern quadrant although the national hurricane center reported the peak reading could have been contaminated due to graupel in the clouds based on the observations it is estimated felix attained winds of by on september 3 while located about southeast of kingston jamaica making felix a category 5 hurricane on the saffir simpson hurricane scale while investigating the hurricane hurricane hunters encountered extreme turbulence and potentially dangerous graupel which forced the flight to abort the mission 19 continuing quickly westward the diameter of the eye decreased to 20 and the national hurricane center estimates the hurricane attained a minimum central pressure of hpa about seven hours after it reached status 2 initially felix was predicted to track west northwestward striking belize before crossing the peninsula 20 however its path remained nearly due westward subsequently cloud tops near the center started to warm as the eye became less distinct 21 and by on september 3 felix weakened to status with winds of 22 on september 4 felix had completed an eyewall replacement cycle and began strengthening again during the day 23 felix was upgraded to a for the second time at 24 and made landfall in extreme north eastern nicaragua shortly thereafter with winds of 25 by nine hours after moving ashore the system maintained a well organized cloud pattern and intense rainbands although the winds rapidly decreased 26 early on september 5 felix weakened to a tropical storm as its upper level circulation became detached from the low level portion 27 the system deteriorated to a tropical depression as it crossed into southern honduras and at the national hurricane center issued the last advisory on felix as it began degenerating into a broad low pressure area 28 the remnants of felix tracked west northwestward over other portions of latin america and eventually dissipated over the mexican state of tabasco on september 7 2 preparations edit hurricane felix in the western caribbean sea nearing central america on september 3 upon becoming a tropical cyclone a tropical storm
