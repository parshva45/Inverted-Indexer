generation modular space station in low earth orbit the proposal would use opsek to assemble components of manned interplanetary spacecraft destined for mars the moon and possibly saturn the returning crew would also recover on the station before landing on earth this opsek could form part of a future network of stations supporting manned exploration of the solar system in early plans the station would at first consist of modules from the russian orbital segment of the international space station iss however in september 2017 the head of roscosmos igor komarov said that the technical feasibility of separating the station to form opsek had been studied and there were now no plans to separate the russian segment from the iss we keep the same position that we should work on the iss

edit around the predicted decommissioning of the international space station in the late 2020s the russian federal space agency roscosmos plans to construct a successor station in low earth orbit early proposals considered re using some iss modules to form the first parts of a new station which would late be replaced by new modules 4 on 17 june 2009 roscosmos officially informed its iss partner nasa about its intention to build and prepare for operation the first elements of the orbital assembly and experimental piloted space complex by the end of the iss life cycle 4 as of 2017 those plans had been abandoned and the new station was to be composed entirely of new purpose built modules 3 according to the russian manned spaceflight contractor rkk energia the new station must be able to perform the following tasks 5 large spacecraft assembly flight tests and launches creating servicing and completing inter orbital tugs providing medical and biological conditions required for the rehabilitation of interplanetary expedition crews after their return to earth orbit structure edit opsek will follow the salyut and almaz series cosmos 557 and mir as the 12th russian space station launched opsek is a third generation 6 modular space station 7 other examples of modular station projects include the soviet russian mir the international space station and the chinese space station the first space station salyut 1 and other one piece or monolithic first generation space stations such as salyut 2 3 4 5 dos 2 kosmos 557 almaz and skylab station were not designed for re supply 8 generally each crew had to depart the station to free the only docking port for the next crew to arrive skylab had more than one docking port but was not designed for resupply salyut 6 and 7 had more than one docking port and were designed to be resupplied routinely during crewed operation 9 modular stations can allow the mission to be changed over time and new modules can be added or removed from the existing structure allowing greater flexibility citation needed annotated image of the international space station s russian orbital segment configuration as of 2011 modules edit this section needs to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information october 2017 expected russian orbital segment modules around the time of opsek separation 2020 or later arranged by launch dates 2000 zvezda dos 8 potential part of opsek 10 2009 poisk mrm 2 potential part of opsek poisk russian lit search also known as the mini research module 2 mrm 2 2 or 2 poisk is a russian airlock module with two identical hatches its predecessor pirs is used to store service and refurbish russian orlan suits the outermost docking ports on both airlocks allow docking of soyuz and progress spacecraft and the automatic transfer of propellants to and from storage on the station 11 rassvet left of center with the russian science airlock temporarily stored on its side 2018 nauka fgb 2 to form part of opsek nauka russian lit science also known as the multipurpose laboratory module mlm or fgb 2 russian or is the major russian laboratory module this module will be separated from the iss before de orbit with support modules to become the opsek space station it contains an additional set of life support systems and orientation control mission has changed over time during the mid 1990s it was intended as a backup for the first fgb and later as a universal docking module udm its docking ports will be able to support automatic docking of both spacecraft additional modules and fuel transfer prior to the arrival of the mlm a progress robotic spacecraft will dock with the iss pirs module depart with that module and both will be discarded nauka will then use its own engines to attach itself to the ros after 2014 12 the european robotic arm which will service the russian orbital segment will be launched alongside the mlm 13 computer generated image of the ros after nauka docking 2018 uzlovoy module to form part of opsek node module um nm this 4 ton ball shaped module will support the docking of two scientific and power modules during the final stage of the station assembly and provide the russian segment additional docking ports to receive soyuz tma transportation modified anthropometric and progress m spacecraft nm is to be incorporated into the iss in 2016 it will be integrated with a special version of the progress cargo ship and launched by a standard soyuz rocket the progress would use its own propulsion and flight control system to deliver and dock the node module to the nadir earth facing docking port of the nauka mlm fgb 2 module one port is equipped with an active hybrid docking port which enables docking with the mlm module the remaining five ports are passive hybrids enabling docking of soyuz and progress vehicles as well as heavier modules and future spacecraft with modified docking systems more importantly the node module was conceived to serve as the only permanent element of opsek equipped with six docking ports the node module would serve as a single permanent core of the future station with all other modules coming and going as their life span and mission required 14 15 uzlovoy will be launched after nauka mlm launch dates will be 2017 or later 16 science and power module 1 nem 1 to form part of opsek 17 ros modules not utilized in opsek edit russian orbital segment modules scheduled for de orbiting 2014 pirs dc 1 to be de orbited before the launch of mlm nauka and that module will utilize the current pirs port at the iss russian orbital segment modules that are neither scheduled for de orbit nor included in the opsek proposals 1998 zarya fgb 1 owned by nasa 18 could be traded for soyuz progress flights after currently contracted flights 19 20 21 are exhausted 2010 rassvet mrm 1 currently docked at zarya 22 if zarya is not utilized in opsek it would have to be moved to another ros
