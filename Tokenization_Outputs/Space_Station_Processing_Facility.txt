space station processing facility wikipedia space station processing facility from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the space station processing facility sspf is a three story 42,500 m 2 457,000 square foot building located in the kennedy space center industrial area just east of the operations and checkout building 1 it was built for the processing of international space station flight hardware the sspf includes two processing bays an airlock operational control rooms laboratories logistics areas office space and a cafeteria the processing areas airlock and laboratories were designed to support non hazardous station and space shuttle payloads in 100,000 class clean work areas station integration testing edit regarding the launch of modules of the international space station iss there had been philosophical differences for years between designers and payload processors whether to ship and shoot or perform integration testing prior to launch the former involved building a station module and launching it without ever physically testing it with other modules the integration testing was not originally in the iss plan but in 1995 johnson space center designers began to consider it and embedding ksc personnel at module factories multi element integration testing meit of iss modules at ksc was officially in the books in 1997 2 3 4 three meit and one integration systems test ist tests were conducted for the iss taking about three years from planning to completion and closure 5 meit1 us lab z1 truss p6 truss and a node 1 emulator planning began in 1997 testing began january 1999 meit2 s0 truss mobile transporter mobile base system s1 truss p1 truss p3 truss p4 truss and a us lab emulator meit3 japanese experiment module node 2 and the us lab emulator completed in 2007 node2 ist node 2 and us lab and node 1 emulators as part of the iss flight emulator after the launch of the u s laboratory module an emulator was built for meit testing since the lab controlled many other modules among the items checked were mechanical connections the ability to flow power and fluids between modules and the flight software numerous issues were found from these on the ground tests many of which have been fixed in orbit many of the builders accompanied their modules from around the world and worked at ksc for months to years during testing many of the modules were renamed after successfully launching station components currently in the sspf edit tranquility in the sspf as of 6 april 2011 update multi purpose logistics modules
