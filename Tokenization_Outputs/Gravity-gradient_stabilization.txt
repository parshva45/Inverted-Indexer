gravity gradient stabilization wikipedia gravity gradient stabilization from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search gravity gradient stabilization a k a tidal stabilization is a method of stabilizing artificial satellites or space tethers in a fixed orientation using only the orbited mass distribution and gravitational field the main advantage over using active stabilization with propellants gyroscopes or reaction wheels is the low use of power and resources the idea is to use the earth s gravitational field and tidal forces to keep the spacecraft aligned in the desired orientation the gravity of the earth decreases according to the inverse square law and by extending the long axis perpendicular to the orbit the lower part of the orbiting structure will be more attracted to the earth the effect is that the satellite will tend to align its axis of minimum moment of inertia vertically the first experimental attempt to use the technique on a human spaceflight was performed on september 13 1966 on the us gemini 11 mission by attaching the gemini spacecraft to its agena target vehicle by a 100 feet tether the attempt was a failure as insufficient gradient was produced to keep the tether taut 1 the technique was first successfully used in a near geosynchronous orbit on the department of defense gravity experiment dodge satellite in july 1967 2 it was first used for low earth orbit and tested unsuccessfully for geosynchronous orbit in the applications technology satellites ats 2 ats 4 and ats 5 from 1966 until 1969 citation needed long duration exposure facility ldef used this method for 3 axis stabilization yaw about the vertical axis was stabilized 3 7 an example of gravity gradient stabilization was attempted during tss 1 mission in july 1992 the project failed because of tether deployment problems 4 in 1996 another mission tss 1r was attempted but failed when the tether broke just prior to tether separation the tension on the tether was about 65 n 5 see also edit gravity gradiometry space tether tidal locking external links edit nasa on ats 2 space page on ats 2 4 and 5 a new kind of earth sensor using a proof mass on a mems created by epfl students references edit gatland kenneth 1976 manned spacecraft second revision new york ny usa macmillan publishing co inc isbn 0-02-542820-9 space page dodge lesson learned from the long duration exposure facility stuckey 1993 https link springer com article 10 1007 2fbf02506678 nasa tss 1r mission failure investigation board final report may 31 1996 accessed 7 april 2011 this spacecraft or satellite related article is a stub you can help wikipedia by expanding it v t e retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title gravity gradient stabilization oldid 809309976 categories spacecraft attitude control spacecraft propulsion spacecraft components tidal forces spacecraft stubs hidden categories use american english from may 2017 all wikipedia articles written in american english all articles with unsourced statements articles with unsourced statements from december 2012 use british english oxford spelling from january 2014 all stub articles navigation menu personal tools not logged in talk contributions create account log in namespaces article talk variants views read edit view history more search navigation main page contents featured content current events random article donate to wikipedia wikipedia store interaction help about wikipedia community portal recent changes contact page tools what links here related changes upload file special pages permanent link page information wikidata item cite this page print export create a book download as pdf printable version languages add links this page was last edited on 8 november 2017 at 10 07 text is available under the creative commons attribution sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
