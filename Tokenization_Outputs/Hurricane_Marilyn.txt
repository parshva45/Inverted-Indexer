luis hurricane marilyn was the most powerful storm to hit the virgin islands since hurricane hugo of 1989 marilyn formed late in the utc day on september 13 and reached hurricane strength soon thereafter marilyn struck the lesser antilles on september 14 at strength and intensified to nearly strength by the time it reached the u s virgin islands a hurricane hunter reconnaissance flight reported hail which is unusual for tropical cyclones after heading north past bermuda marilyn weakened and became extratropical on september 22 the remnant circulation wandered the atlantic ocean from

meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the scale origins were from a tropical wave that formed off the african coast on september 7 large low level winds were included in the circulation but little convection existed 3 the system continued west for a few days at about next to an anticyclonic aloft on september 12 satellite pictures viewed the disorganized wave and declared it tropical depression fifteen after convection had increased tropical depression fifteen strengthened rapidly becoming tropical storm marilyn six hours later one day after being named marilyn was upgraded to hurricane status while turning on a more northwesterly track 3 4 for the next few days track took it towards the west northwest and to the northwest due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge marilyn was a category 1 hurricane it passed north of barbados and martinique 3 marilyn passed over dominica and just des saintes and southwest of guadeloupe on september 14 bringing heavy rains and strong winds with it marilyn continued on its northwesterly track making landfall in the u s virgin islands on september 15 packing winds of a strong strength hurricane the eyewall east southeast of the center of marilyn passed over saint thomas later that day after passing over puerto rico marilyn entered back into the atlantic ocean on september 16 3 hurricane marilyn near puerto rico a low had formed near marilyn which may have enhanced outflow from the system an eye formed in the center of marilyn and the storm reached a peak intensity of 949 millibars and winds of only a lower end hurricane at this time marilyn was predicted to peak in wind speeds of 5 6 7 8 reconnaissance data found a concentric pair of eyewall wind maxima marilyn started weakening rapidly falling from peak level winds of down to 3 the central pressure also rose up 20 mbars in only this rapid weakening was caused by westerly shear and dry air entrained in the system a decaying eyewall and especially cool waters upwelled from the previous powerful storm hurricane luis as marilyn weakened to category 1 hurricane status and moved north northwest it passed about west of bermuda on september 19 as marilyn encountered more westerly shear it weakened to below hurricane status and made its extratropical transition on september 20 centered in the northeastern atlantic 3 the remnant circulation continued to erratically move through the central atlantic ocean for another before being absorbed by a frontal low on september 30 a hurricane hunter reconnaissance flight reported hail which is unusual for tropical cyclones 3 preparations edit hurricane marilyn on crossing the virgin islands on september 15 1995 seventeen watches and or warnings

the exact figure for damages in the u s virgin islands and puerto rico is not available although the american insurance services group set the combined damage at aside from high winds and seas one possible explanation for the heavy damage may have been complacency on the part of local island populations marilyn followed on the heels of luis a more powerful category 4 hurricane initially predicted to pass very close to st thomas this prediction prompted locals to be particularly thorough in their pre storm preparations however luis passed further away from the island and caused relatively moderate damage virgin islanders questioned the accuracy of the national hurricane center wind advisories as hurricane marilyn caused significant damage for a mere category 2 storm damage on st thomas was remiscent of the damage seen on st croix in 1989 when hurricane hugo a category 4 storm caused catastrophic damage because st thomas is a very hilly island it is possible that sustained winds on exposed hills some of which have elevations that are thousands of feet above sea level were significantly stronger than the sea level wind speed estimates given by the hurricane center in its main advisory residents also reported tornado vortices in certain neighborhoods 3 martinique edit rainfalls in martinique peaked at in morne rouge in ajoupa bouillon in saint pierre
