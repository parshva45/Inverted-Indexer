spacesuit on mars a human mission to mars has been the subject of science fiction aerospace engineering and scientific proposals since the 19th century the plans comprise proposals to land on mars eventually settling on and terraforming the planet while utilizing its moons phobos and deimos the exploration of mars has been a goal of national space programs for decades preliminary work for missions that would involve human explorers has been undertaken since the 1950s with planned missions typically being stated as taking place 10 to 30 years in the future when they are drafted the list of manned mars mission plans in the 20th century shows the various mission proposals that have been put forth by multiple organizations and space agencies in this field of space exploration in the 2010s numerous chinese european and american agencies were developing proposals for human missions to mars none have moved past the planning stages mars in fiction is a frequent target of exploration

external links travel to mars edit three views of planet mars the red planet closest approaches of mars to earth 2014-2061 communication times are slightly shorter when it is closest the energy needed for transfer between planetary orbits or is lowest at intervals fixed by the synodic period for earth mars trips this is every 26 months 2 years and 2 months 1 so missions are typically planned to coincide with one of these launch windows the energy needed in the low energy windows varies on roughly a 15 year cycle 1 with the easiest windows needing only half the energy of the peaks 2 in the 20th century there was a minimum in the 1969 and 1971 launch windows and another low in 1986 and 1988 then the cycle repeated 1 several types of mission plans have been proposed such as the opposition class and conjunction class 2 or the crocco flyby 3 the lowest energy transfer to mars is a hohmann transfer orbit a mission to mars using hohmann transfer involves an approximately 9 month travel time from earth to mars about five hundred days at mars to wait for the transfer window to earth and a hohmann transfer of about 9 months to return to earth shorter mars mission plans have round trip flight times of 400 to 450 days 4 but requiring a higher energy a fast mars mission of 245 days round trip could be possible with on orbit staging 5 in 2014 ballistic capture was proposed which may reduce fuel cost and provide more flexible launch windows compared to the hohmann 6 in the crocco grand tour a crewed spacecraft would get a flyby of mars and venus for under a year in space 7 some flyby mission architectures can also be extended to include a style of mars landing with a flyby excursion lander spacecraft 8 proposed by r titus in 1966 it involved extending a flyby mission with a short stay lander 8 basically a short stay lander ascent vehicle would separate from a parent earth mars transfer prior to its flyby of mars 8 the ascent decent lander would arrive sooner and either go into orbit around mars or land and depending on the design offer perhaps days before it needed to launch itself back to the main transfer vehicle 8 see also mars flyby challenges edit logistical edit the estimated cost of sending humans to mars is roughly 500 billion u s dollars though the actual costs are likely to be more 9 the largest limiting factor for sending humans to mars is funding in the late 1950s rivalry between the soviet union and the united states stimulated a national priority to send humans to the moon under the current global geopolitical climate however government funding of these programs has decreased recent participation of private companies in space travel and participation by new nations such as india 10 may present new opportunities critics argue the immediate benefits of establishing a human presence on mars are more esoteric than practical yet proponents of human space exploration contend that while the short term benefits will be academic the symbolism of establishing a presence in space may garner public interest to join the cause and spark global cooperation furthermore experts maintain that a long term investment will be necessary for survival 9 physical edit in the artistic vision the spacecraft provides artificial gravity by spinning see also centrifugal force comparison of radiation doses includes the amount detected on the trip from earth to mars by the rad inside the msl 2011 2013 11 12 13 the vertical axis is in logarithmic scale so the dose over a mars year is about 15 times the doe limit not less than twice as a quick glance might suggest the actual dose would depend on a number of factors such as design of the spacecraft and natural events such as solar flares there are several key physical challenges for human missions to mars 14 health threats from exposure to high energy cosmic rays and other ionizing radiation 15 16 17 in may 2013 nasa scientists reported that a possible mission to mars may involve a great radiation risk based on the amount of energetic particle radiation detected by the rad on the mars science laboratory while traveling from the earth to mars in 2011-2012 the calculated radiation dose was 0.66 sieverts round trip the career radiation limit for astronauts is 1 sievert 11 12 13 18 in september 2017 nasa reported radiation levels on the surface of the planet mars were temporarily doubled and were associated with an aurora 25 times brighter than any observed earlier due to a massive and unexpected solar storm in the middle of the month 19 negative effects of a prolonged weightlessness environment on human health including eyesight visual impairment 20 21 22 depends on mission and spacecraft design psychological effects of isolation from earth and by extension the lack of community due to impossibility of real time connections with earth compare hermit social effects of several humans living under cramped conditions for more than one earth year possibly two or three years on the mission to mars and a comparable length of time on the return to earth depends on spacecraft and mission design inaccessibility of terrestrial medical facilities potential failure of propulsion or life support equipment some of these issues were estimated statistically in the humex study 23 ehlmann and others have reviewed political and economic concerns as well as technological and biological feasibility aspects 24 while fuel for roundtrip travel could be a challenge methane and oxygen can be produced using martian h 2 o preferably as water ice instead of liquid water and atmospheric co 2 with mature technology 25 planetary protection edit see also planetary protection robotic spacecraft to mars are required to be sterilized to have at most 300,000 spores on the exterior of the more thoroughly sterilized if they contact special regions containing water 26 27 as otherwise there is a risk of contaminating not only the life detection experiments but possibly the planet itself 28 it is impossible to sterilize human missions to this level as humans are host to typically a hundred trillion microorganisms of thousands of species of the human microbiome and these cannot be removed while preserving the life of the human containment seems the only option but it is a major challenge in the event of a hard landing i e crash 29 there have been several planetary workshops on this issue but with no final guidelines for a way forward yet 30 human explorers would also be vulnerable to back contamination to earth if they become carriers of microorganisms 31 mission proposals edit main article list of manned mars mission plans 20th century edit fuel is mined from phobos with the help of a nuclear reactor 32 over the last century a number of mission concepts for such an expedition have been proposed david history volume humans to mars fifty years of mission planning discusses many of these 1 wernher von braun proposal 1947 through 1950s edit wernher von braun was the first person to make a detailed technical study of a mars mission 1 33 details were published in his book das marsprojekt 1952 published in english as the mars project in 1962 34 and several subsequent works 35 and featured in magazine in a series of articles beginning march 1952 a variant of the von braun mission concept was popularized in english by willy ley in the book the conquest of space 1949 featuring illustrations by chesley bonestell citation needed von mars project envisioned nearly a thousand three stage vehicles launching from earth to ferry parts for the mars mission to be constructed at a space station in earth orbit 33 36 the mission itself featured a fleet of ten spacecraft with a combined crew of 70 heading to mars bringing three winged surface excursion ships that would land horizontally on the surface of mars winged landing was considered possible because at the time of his proposal the martian atmosphere was believed to be much denser than was later found to be the case in the 1956 revised vision of the mars project plan published in the book the exploration of mars by wernher von braun and willy ley the size of the mission was trimmed requiring only 400 launches to put together two ships still carrying a winged landing vehicle 37 later versions of the mission proposal featured in the disney man in space film series 38 showed nuclear powered ion propulsion vehicles for the interplanetary cruise u s proposals 1950s 1960s and 1970s edit conception of the mars excursion module mem proposed in a nasa study in 1963 in 1962 aeronutronic ford 39 general dynamics and the lockheed missiles and space company made studies of mars mission designs as part of nasa marshall spaceflight center project empire 33 these studies indicated that a mars mission possibly including a venus fly by could be done with a launch of eight saturn v boosters and assembly in low earth orbit or possibly with a single launch of a hypothetical post saturn heavy lift vehicle although the empire missions were only studies and never proposed as funded projects these were the first detailed analyses of what it would take to accomplish a human voyage to mars using data from actual nasa spaceflight and laid much of the basis for future studies including significant mission studies by trw north american philco lockheed douglas and general dynamics along with several in house nasa studies 33 following the success of the apollo program von braun advocated a manned mission to mars as a focus for manned space program 40 von proposal used saturn v boosters to launch nuclear powered nerva upper stages that would power two six crew spacecraft on a dual mission in the early 1980s the proposal was considered by then president richard nixon but passed over in favor of the space shuttle in 1975 von braun discussed the mission architecture that emerged from these apollo era studies in a recorded lecture and while doing so suggested that multiple shuttle launches could instead be configured to lift the two nuclear thermal rocket engine equipped spacecrafts in smaller parts for assembly in orbit 41 soviet mission proposals 1956 through 1969 edit main articles martian piloted complex and tmk the martian piloted complex or mpk was a proposal by mikhail tikhonravov of the soviet union for a manned mars expedition using the then proposed n 1 rocket in studies from 1956 to 1962 the soviets sent many probes to mars with some noted success stories including mars atmospheric entry but the ratio was low and their space program struggled through disasters like the lost salyut 1 crew and explosions of their n 1 rocket see mars 3 heavy interplanetary spacecraft known by the russian acronym tmk was the designation of a soviet union space exploration proposal in the 1960s to send a manned flight to mars and venus tmk mavr design without landing the tmk spacecraft was due to launch in 1971 and make a three year long flight including a mars fly by at which time probes would have been dropped the project was never completed because the required n1 rocket never flew successfully the mars expeditionary complex or mek 1969 was another soviet proposal for a mars expedition that would take a crew from three to six to mars and back with a total mission duration of 630 days case for mars edit following the viking missions to mars between 1981 and 1996 a series of conferences named the case for mars were held at the university of colorado at boulder these conferences advocated human exploration of mars presented concepts and technologies and held a series of workshops to develop a baseline concept for the mission the baseline concept was notable in that it proposed use of in situ resource utilization to manufacture rocket propellant for the return trip using the resources of mars the mission study was published in a series of proceedings volumes 42 43 published by the american astronautical society later conferences in the series presented a number of alternative concepts including the mars direct concept of robert zubrin and david baker the footsteps to mars proposal of geoffrey a landis 44 which proposed intermediate steps before the landing on mars including human missions to phobos and the great exploration proposal from lawrence livermore national laboratory among others nasa space exploration initiative 1989 edit main article space exploration initiative conception of a human mission on the surface of mars 1989 painting by les bossinas of lewis research center for nasa in response to a presidential initiative nasa made a study of a project for human lunar and mars exploration as a proposed follow on to the international space station project this resulted in a report called the 90 day study 45 in which the agency proposed a long term plan consisting of completing the space station as a critical next step in all our space endeavors returning to the moon and establishing a permanent base and then sending astronauts to mars this report was widely criticized as too elaborate and expensive and all funding for human exploration beyond earth orbit was canceled by congress 46 mars direct early 1990s edit main article mars direct because of the distance between mars and earth the mars mission would be much more risky and more expensive than past manned flights to the moon supplies and fuel would have to be prepared for a 2-3 year round trip and the spacecraft would have to be designed with at least partial shielding from intense solar radiation a 1990 paper by robert zubrin and david a baker then of martin marietta proposed reducing the mission mass and hence the cost with a mission design using in situ resource utilization to manufacture propellant from the martian atmosphere 47 48 this proposal drew on a number of concepts developed by the former case for mars conference series over the next decade this proposal was developed by zubrin into a mission concept mars direct which he developed in a book the case for mars 1996 the mission is advocated by the mars society which zubrin founded in 1998 as a practical and affordable plan for a manned mars mission international space university 1991 edit in 1991 in toulouse france the international space university studied an international human mars mission 49 they proposed a crew of 8 traveling to mars in a nuclear powered vessel with artificial gravity provided by rotation 49 on the surface 40 tonne habitats pressurized to were powered by a photovoltaic array 49 nasa design reference missions 1990s edit main article mars design reference mission nasa mars habitat concept for dra 1.0 derived from the mars direct architecture 1995 in the 1990s nasa developed several conceptual level human mars exploration architectures one of these was nasa design reference mission 3.0 drm 3.0 it was a study performed by the nasa mars exploration team at the johnson space center jsc in the 1990s personnel representing several nasa field centers formulated a reference mission addressing human exploration of mars the plan describes a human mission to mars with concepts of operations and technologies to be used as a first cut at an architecture the architecture for the mars reference mission builds on previous work principally on the work of the synthesis group 1991 and 1991 concepts for the use of propellants derived from the martian atmosphere the primary purpose of the reference mission was to stimulate further thought and development of alternative approaches which can improve effectiveness reduce risks and reduce cost improvements can be made at several levels for example in the architectural mission and system levels selected other us nasa plans 50 1988

orbital mission to mars using a nuclear reactor to run an electric rocket engine proposed in october 2000 by yuri karash from the russian academy of cosmonautics as the next step for russia in space along with the russian participation in the international space station a 30 volume draft project for marpost was confirmed as of 2005 53 design for the ship was proposed to be ready in 2012 and the ship itself in 2021 54 esa aurora programme 2001 edit main article aurora programme artwork featuring astronauts enduring a mars dust storm near a rover the european space agency had a long term vision of sending a human mission to mars in 2033 55 laid out in 2001 the proposed timeline would begin with robotic exploration a proof of concept simulation of sustaining humans on mars and eventually a manned mission however objections from the participating nations of esa and other delays have put the timeline into question nevertheless a spawn of this programme exomars delivered an orbiter to mars in 2016 esa russia plan 2002 edit another proposal for a joint esa mission with russia is based on two spacecraft being sent to mars one carrying a six person crew and the other the supplies the mission would take about 440 days to complete with three astronauts visiting the surface of the planet for a period of two months the entire project would cost $20 billion and russia would contribute 30% of these funds 56 usa vision for space exploration 2004 edit main article vision for space exploration project constellation included an orion mars mission then united states president george w bush announced an initiative of manned space exploration on january 14 2004 known as the vision for space exploration it included developing preliminary plans for a lunar outpost by 2012 57 and establishing an outpost by 2020 precursor missions that would help develop the needed technology during the 2010-2020 decade were tentatively outlined by adringa and others 58 on september 24 2007 michael griffin then nasa administrator hinted that nasa may be able to launch a human mission to mars by 2037 59 the needed funds were to be generated by diverting $11 billion 60 from space science missions to the vision for human exploration nasa has also discussed plans to launch mars missions from the moon to reduce traveling costs 61 mars society germany european mars mission emm 2005 edit the mars society germany proposed a manned mars mission using several launches of an improved heavy lift version of the ariane 5 roughly 5 launches would be required to send a crew of 5 on a 1200 days mission with a payload of total project was estimated to cost 10 to 15 billion euros 62 china national space administration cnsa 2006 edit main article chinese space program to mars and beyond sun laiyan administrator of the china national space administration said on july 20 2006 that china would start deep space exploration focusing on mars over the next five years during the eleventh five year plan program period 63 the first uncrewed mars exploration program could take place between followed by a crewed phase in 2040-2060 in which crew members would land on mars and return home 64 the mars 500 study of 2011 prepared for this manned mission the one way trip option 2006 mars to stay 2006 edit main article mars to stay the idea of a one way trip to mars has been proposed several times space activist bruce mackenzie for example proposed a one way trip to mars in a presentation one way to mars a permanent settlement on the first mission at the 1998 international space development conference 65 arguing that since the mission could be done with less difficulty and expense if the astronauts were not required to return to earth the first mission to mars should be a settlement not a visit in 2006 former nasa engineer james c mclane iii proposed a scheme to initially colonize mars via a one way trip by only one human papers discussing this concept appeared in the space review 66 magazine 67 search magazine 68 and the new york times 69 mars to stay proposes that astronauts sent to mars for the first time should stay there indefinitely both to reduce mission cost and to ensure permanent settlement of mars among many notable mars to stay advocates former apollo astronaut buzz aldrin is a particularly outspoken promoter who has suggested in numerous forums forget the moon head to mars 70 in june 2013 aldrin wrote an opinion published in the new york times supporting a manned mission to mars and which viewed the moon not as a destination but more a point of departure one that places humankind on a trajectory to homestead mars and become a two planet species 71 in august 2015 aldrin in association with the florida institute of technology presented a master plan for nasa consideration proposing astronauts with a tour of duty of ten years colonize mars before the year 2040 72 nasa design reference mission 5.0 2007 edit nasa

former u s president barack obama predicted a manned mars mission to orbit the planet by the mid 2030s followed by a landing by the mid 2030s i believe we can send humans to orbit mars and return them safely to earth and a landing on mars will follow and i expect to be around to see it the united states congress has mostly approved a new direction for nasa that includes canceling planned return to the moon by 2020 and instead proposes asteroid exploration in 2025 asteroid redirect mission and orbiting mars in the 2030s 74 martian frontier 2007 2011 edit mars 500 the longest high fidelity spaceflight simulation ran from 2007 to 2011 in russia and was an experiment to assess the feasibility of manned missions to mars 75 russian mission proposals 2011 edit a number of mars mission concepts and proposals have been put forth by russian scientists stated dates were for a launch sometime between 2016 and 2020 the mars probe would carry a crew of four to five cosmonauts who would spend close to two years in space citation needed in late 2011 russian and european space agencies successfully completed the ground based mars 500 76 the biomedical experiment simulating manned flight to mars was completed in russia in july 2000 77 2-4-2 concept edit in 2011 jean marc salotti published a new proposal for a manned mars mission with a release in 2012 78 79 the 2-4-2 concept is based on a reduction of the crew size to only 2 astronauts and the duplication of the entire mission there are 2 astronauts in each space vehicle there are 4 on the surface of mars and there are 2 once again in each return vehicle in addition at every step of the mission there are 2 astronauts ready to help the 2 others 2 for 2 this architecture simplifies the entry descent and landing procedures which are known to be very risky thanks to a significant reduction of the size of the landing vehicles it also avoids the assembly of huge vehicles in leo the author claims that his proposal is much cheaper than the nasa reference mission without compromising the risks and can be undertaken before 2030 conceptual space vehicle architecture for human exploration of mars 2012 edit in 2012 conceptual space vehicle architecture for human exploration of mars with artificial gravity and mini magnetosphere crew radiation shield was released laying out a possible design for a human mars mission 80 components of the architecture include various spacecraft for the earth to mars journey landing and surface stay as well as return 80 some features include a several unmanned cargo landers assembled into a base on the surface of mars 80 the crew would land at this base in the mars personnel lander which could also take them back into mars orbit 80 the design for the manned interplanetary spacecraft included artificial gravity and an artificial magnetic field 80 overall the architecture was modular and to allow for incremental r d 80 mars one 2012 edit main article mars one in 2012 a dutch entrepreneur group began raising funds for a human mars base to be established in 2023 81 one difference from many other humans to mars projects is that the mission is intended to be primarily a settlement mission with no return trip to earth planned astronaut applications were invited from the public all over the world the initial plan included that a telecom orbiter and isru demonstration lander would be sent in 2018 followed by a rover in 2020 and the base components in 2024 81 the base would be powered by 3,000 square meters of solar panels 82 mars one suggested it could use a spacex heavy rocket to launch flight hardware 81 the first crew of four astronauts were to land on mars in 2025 then every two years a new crew of four astronauts would arrive plans included selecting and training candidates and that the entire mission is to be filmed and broadcast back to earth as a media event revenues from broadcasting would help fund the program on top of private investments and monetizing ip rights in april 2015 lansdorp admitted that their 12 year plan for landing humans on mars by 2027 is mostly fiction 83 inspiration mars foundation 2013 edit main article inspiration mars foundation in 2013 the inspiration mars foundation founded by dennis tito revealed plans of a manned mission to fly by mars in 2018 with support from nasa 84 85 boeing affordable mission 2014 edit on december 2 2014 advanced human exploration systems and operations mission director jason crusan and deputy associate administrator for programs james reuthner announced tentative support for the boeing affordable mars mission design clarification needed including radiation shielding centrifugal artificial gravity in transit consumable resupply and a lander which can return 86 87 reuthner suggested that if adequate funding was forthcoming the proposed mission would be expected in the early 2030s 88 journey to mars pioneering next steps in space exploration 2015 edit rendering of a block 1 sls on october 8 2015 nasa published its official plan for human exploration and colonization of mars the plan operates through three distinct phases leading up to fully sustained colonization 89 the first stage already underway is the earth reliant phase this phase continues utilizing the international space station until 2024 validating deep space technologies and studying the effects of long duration space missions on the human body the second stage proving ground moves away from earth reliance and ventures into cislunar space for most of its tasks this is when nasa plans to capture an asteroid planned for 2020 test deep space habitation facilities and validate capabilities required for human exploration of mars finally phase three is the transition to independence from earth resources the earth independent phase includes long term missions on the lunar surface which leverage surface habitats that only require routine maintenance and the harvesting of martian resources for fuel water and building materials nasa is still aiming for human missions to mars in the 2030s though earth independence could take decades longer 90 bolden speech 2015 edit in november 2015 the administrator of nasa reaffirmed the goal of sending humans to mars 91 he laid out 2030 as the date of a manned surface landing and noted that planned 2020 mars rover would be in support of the human mission 91 also discussed was the use of robotics to prepare an underground habitat for the arriving people 91 he noted the advantages of living underground on mars especially that it eliminates the need to construct above ground shielding 91 top surface activity was not excluded however just that the crew would probably live underground for the most part 91 living underground on mars offered many advantages in regards to human survivability 91 the underground base would be prepared in advance by an armada of robots robotic precursors to human presence 91 interplanetary transport system 2016 edit main article interplanetary transport system in september 2016 spacex publicly announced a comprehensive vision to begin the colonization of mars called interplanetary transport system formerly mars colonial transporter including a number of high level design details for an its launch vehicle and the interplanetary spaceship and its tanker spacecraft that would provide the on orbit pieces of the transportation technology as well as a propellant plant to be built on mars at a base referred to as mars base alpha 92 the aspirational objective is to advance the technology and infrastructure such that the first humans to mars could potentially depart as early as 2024 93 94 95 96 97 98 mars base camp 2016 edit mars base camp mbc an american spacecraft concept that proposes to send astronauts to mars as early as 2028 the vehicle design developed by lockheed martin 99 would utilize both future and heritage concepts as well as the orion mpcv built by nasa deep space transport 2017 edit deep space transport main article deep space transport the deep space transport dst is a spacecraft meant to be launched on top of sls launch vehicle in 2027 it was announced by nasa in march 2017 100 plans at present predict it to dock with the deep space gateway dsg station which would be in cis lunar space after its construction from 2021 to 2026 as a manned lunar space station the first of its kind in 2027 current plans show it to be sent with a crew of 4 to mars in 2033 it would not however land but merely remain in martian orbit until there is a launch window for a return the mission is expected to take about 2 years if all missions in the dsg and dst from 2021-2030 are successful this mission would use only the sls rocket for launches with the orion mpcv to be used as a spacecraft to transport the crew to and from the earth and the dsg and dst 101 102 current intentions by nations and space agencies edit rendering of the planned orion dsh cryogenic propulsion module assembly a number of nations and organizations have long term intentions to send humans to mars the united states has a number of robotic missions currently exploring mars with a sample return planned for the future on december 5 2014 nasa successfully launched and tested the orion multi purpose crew vehicle mpcv the first component of planned mars mission program the orion mpcv will serve as the launch splashdown crew delivery vehicle in combination with a deep space habitat module which will provide additional living space for the crew on the 16 month long journey from earth to mars and back the first manned mars mission which will include sending astronauts to mars orbiting mars and a return to earth is currently scheduled for the 2030s 103 104 105 technology development to facilitate us government missions to mars is underway but the obama administration like several presidential administrations before has not left a well funded approach to actually bring the conceptual project to completion with human landings on mars by the mid 2030s the stated objective 106 nasa is currently under presidential orders to land humans on mars by 2033 and nasa funded engineers have discovered a way to build potential human habitats on that planet by producing bricks from pressurized martian soil with the iron oxide in the soil functioning as a binding agent 107 the european space agency has a long term goal to send humans but has not yet built a manned spacecraft it has sent robotic probes like exomars in 2016 and plans to send the next probe in 2020 a soyuz landing on earth in 2015 india successfully placed an unmanned mars orbiter mission also called mangalyaan satellite in mars orbit on 23 september 2014 108 isro plans to develop and launch a follow up mission called mangalyaan 2 with a greater scientific payload to mars between 2018 and 2020 109 110 this mission will likely consist of a lander and a mars rover 111 112 no plans for an indian human mission to mars have been made public japan has sent one robotic mission to mars in 1998 the nozomi but it failed to achieve mars orbit jaxa has proposed a rover mission called melos for an engineering demonstration of precision landing and to look for possible biosignatures on mars in 2020 or 2022 no plans for a japanese human mission to mars have been made public china s first attempted mission to mars the yinghuo 1 space probe was lost with sample return mission to phobos fobos grunt in 2011-2012 china plans to develop and launch an orbiter lander and rover to mars in july or august 2020 113 114 with a long march 5 heavy lift rocket 115 116 117 a crewed phase is planned for the 2040-2060 timeframe 118 russia plans to send humans in the 2040-2045 timeframe 119 technological innovations and hurdles edit depiction of plants growing in a mars base nasa plans to grow plants in space to help feed astronauts in support of pioneering space 120 nasa has stated that robots will prepare an underground base for a human surface mission 91 significant technological hurdles need to be overcome for human spaceflight to mars entry into the thin and shallow martian atmosphere will pose significant difficulties with re entry and for a spacecraft of the weight needed to carry humans along with life support supplies and other equipment should a heat shield be used it would need to be very large retro rockets could be used but would add significant further weight a return mission to mars will need to land a rocket to carry crew off the surface launch requirements mean that this rocket would be significantly smaller than an earth to orbit rocket mars to orbit launch can also be achieved in single stage despite this landing an ascent rocket on mars will be difficult reentry for a large rocket will be difficult one of the medical supplies that may be needed is intravenous fluid which is mostly water but contains other things so it can be added directly to the human blood stream if it can be created on the spot from existing water then it could spare the weight of hauling earth produced units whose weight is mostly water 121 a prototype for this capability was tested on the international space station in 2010 121 while it is possible for humans to breathe pure oxygen a pure oxygen atmosphere was implicated in the apollo 1 fire as such mars habitats may have a need for additional gases one possibility is to take nitrogen and argon from the atmosphere of mars however they are hard to separate from each other 122 as a result a mars habitat may use 40% argon 40% nitrogen and 20% oxygen 122 another concept for breathing air is to use re usable amine bead carbon dioxide scrubbers 123 while one carbon dioxide scrubber filters the air the other is vented to the mars atmosphere 123 precursor missions edit some missions may be considered a mission to mars in their own right or they may only be one step in a more in depth program an example of this is missions to mars moons or flyby missions manned flyby edit an example of this is inspiration mars which could be compared to the manned venus flyby nasa mission proposal of the 1970s but for mars missions to deimos or phobos edit many mars mission concepts propose precursor missions to the moons of mars for example a sample return mission to the mars moon phobos 124 not quite mars but perhaps a convenient stepping stone to an eventual martian surface mission lockheed martin as part of their stepping stones to mars project called the red rocks project proposed to explore mars robotically from deimos 44 125 126 use of fuel produced from water resources on phobos or deimos has also been proposed mars sample return missions edit artist concept of scim passing through the martian atmosphere this was a simpler sample return architecture that achieved being one of four semi finalists in the 2002 mars scout selection that mission slot was ultimately won by the phoenix lander sample return mission concept an unmanned mars sample return mission msr has sometimes been considered to be an essential precursor to crewed missions to mars surface by the 21st century 127 the esa noted that a sample return as being essential and could bridge the gap between robotic and human missions to mars 127 an example of a mars sample return mission is sample collection for investigation of mars 128 mars sample return was the highest priority flagship mission proposed for nasa by the planetary decadal survey 2013-2022 the future of planetary science 129 however such missions have been hampered by complexity and expense with one esa proposal involving no less than five different unmanned spacecraft 130 a difficulty in sample return plans is the concern that however remote something could be brought back that could infect life on the earth 130 regardless a basic set of guidelines for extraterrestrial sample return have been laid out depending on the source of sample e g asteroid moon mars surface etc 131 hardware and mission parameters are designed following planetary protection protocols so mission concepts can proceed forward in an orderly way without causing undue concern over remote chances 131 the issue of sample protection is another factor that increases the difficulty of sample return both to keep the sample from getting contaminated with earth material or life and achieving a rational approach to keeping the mars sample from contaminating earth 130 at the dawn of the 21st century nasa crafted four potential pathways to mars human missions 132 of those four three included a mars sample return as a prerequisite to human landing however one did not 132 crewed orbital missions edit landis 133 and lupisella proposed to explore mars via telepresence from human astronauts in orbit 134 a similar idea was the proposed human exploration using real time robotic operations herro mission 135 136 another proposed mission was the russian mars piloted orbital station see also edit mars portal spaceflight portal artificial gravity delta vs between earth moon and mars exploration of mars health threat from cosmic rays
