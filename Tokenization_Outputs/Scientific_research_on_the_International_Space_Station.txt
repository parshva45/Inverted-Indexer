scientific research on the international space station wikipedia scientific research on the international space station from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search expedition 8 commander and science officer michael foale conducts an inspection of the microgravity science glovebox esa astronaut thomas reiter sts 116 mission specialist works with the passive observatories for experimental microbial systems in micro g poems payload in the minus eighty degree laboratory freezer for iss melfi inside the destiny laboratory scientific research on the international space station is a collection of experiments that require one or more of the unusual conditions present in low earth orbit the primary fields of research include human research space medicine life sciences physical sciences astronomy and meteorology 1 2 3 the 2005 nasa authorization act designated the american segment of the international space station as a national laboratory with the goal of increasing the use of the iss by other federal agencies and the private sector 4 research on the iss improves knowledge about the effects of long term space exposure on the human body subjects currently under study include muscle atrophy bone loss and fluid shift the data will be used to determine whether space colonisation and lengthy human spaceflight are feasible as of 2006 data on bone loss and muscular atrophy suggest that there would be a significant risk of fractures and movement problems if astronauts landed on a planet after a lengthy interplanetary cruise such as the six month journey time required to fly to mars 5 6 large scale medical studies are conducted aboard the iss via the national space biomedical research institute nsbri prominent among these is the advanced diagnostic ultrasound in microgravity study in which astronauts including former iss commanders leroy chiao and gennady padalka perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts the study considers the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions in space usually there is no physician on board the iss and diagnosis of medical conditions is a challenge it is anticipated that remotely guided ultrasound scans will have application on earth in emergency and rural care situations where access to a trained physician is difficult 7 8 9 researchers are investigating the effect of the near weightless environment on the evolution development growth and internal processes of plants and animals in response to some of this data nasa wants to investigate microgravity s effects on the growth of three dimensional human like tissues and the unusual protein crystals that can be formed in space 2 the investigation of the physics of fluids in microgravity will allow researchers to model the behaviour of fluids better because fluids can be almost completely combined in microgravity physicists investigate fluids that do not mix well on earth in addition an examination of reactions that are slowed by low gravity and temperatures will give scientists a deeper understanding of superconductivity 2 the study of materials science is an important iss research activity with the objective of reaping economic benefits through the improvement of techniques used on the ground 10 other areas of interest include the effect of the low gravity environment on combustion through the study of the efficiency of burning and control of emissions and pollutants these findings may improve our knowledge about energy production and lead to economic and environmental benefits future plans are for the researchers aboard the iss to examine aerosols ozone water vapour and oxides in atmosphere as well as cosmic rays cosmic dust antimatter and dark matter in the universe 2 contents 1 iss science
