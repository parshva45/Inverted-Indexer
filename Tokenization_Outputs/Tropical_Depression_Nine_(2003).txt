late on august 22 south of the eastern tip of the dominican republic 1 the system retained a well defined cloud pattern with a vigorous mid level circulation and forecasters at the national hurricane center indicated regeneration could have occurred at any time 13 the wave axis moved over the dominican republic early on august 23 14 and became disorganized over the mountainous terrain of
