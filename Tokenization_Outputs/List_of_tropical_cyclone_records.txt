notes edit although luis produced the highest confirmed wave height for a tropical cyclone it is possible that hurricane ivan produced a wave measuring 131 feet 36 it is believed that reconnaissance aircraft overestimated wind speeds in tropical cyclones from the 1940s to the 1960s and data from this time period is generally considered unreliable consequently typhoon nancy may not have sustained category 5 winds for such a long duration references edit cerveny randall s jay lawrimore roger edwards christopher landsea june 2007 extreme weather records compilation adjudication and publication
