cyclone ever observed in the gulf of mexico part of the record breaking 2005 atlantic hurricane season which included three of the top ten most intense atlantic hurricanes ever recorded along with 1 wilma and 7 katrina rita was the seventeenth named storm tenth hurricane and fifth major hurricane of the 2005 season rita formed near the bahamas from a tropical wave on 2005 that originally developed off the coast of west africa it moved westward and after passing through the florida straits rita entered an environment of abnormally warm waters moving west northwest it rapidly intensified to reach peak winds of achieving category 5 status on however as rita approached land through september 24 it weakened to a category 3 and began to curve to the northwest making landfall in bayou louisiana between sabine pass texas and holly beach louisiana with winds of rapidly weakening over land rita degenerated into a large low pressure area over the lower mississippi valley by in louisiana storm surge inundated low lying communities along the entire coast worsening effects caused by hurricane katrina less than a month prior such as topping the hurriedly repaired katrina damaged levees at new orleans parishes in southwest louisiana and counties in southeast texas where rita made landfall suffered from catastrophic to severe flooding and wind damage according to an october 25 2005 disaster center report 4,526 single family dwellings were destroyed in orange and jefferson counties located in southeast texas major damage was sustained by 14,256 additional single family dwellings and another 26,211 single family dwellings received minor damage mobile homes and apartments also sustained significant damage or total destruction 1 in all nine texas counties and five louisiana parishes were declared disaster areas after the storm electric service was disrupted in some areas of both texas and louisiana for several weeks texas reported the most deaths from the hurricane where were reported 107 of which were associated with the evacuation of the houston metropolitan area moderate to severe damage was reported across the lower mississippi valley rainfall from

track and intensity of the storm according to the scale on 2005 a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of africa and moved westward into the atlantic ocean failing to produce organized deep atmospheric convection 2 the disturbance was not monitored by the national hurricane center nhc for tropical cyclogenesis 3 convection associated with the system increased briefly late on before dissipating shortly thereafter at roughly the same time a remnant surface trough had developed from a dissipating stationary front and began to drift westward north of the lesser antilles 2 meanwhile the tropical wave slowly became better organized and was first noted in the tropical weather outlooks on while northeast of puerto rico 4 the wave merged with the surface trough two days later triggering an increase in convective activity and organization a subsequent decrease in wind shear enabled for additional organization and at 0000 utc on the nhc estimated that the storm system had organized enough to be classified as a tropical depression 2 the eighteenth disturbance during the hurricane season to do so at the time the disturbance classified as tropical depression eighteen 5 was roughly east of grand turk island in the turks and caicos and had developed banding features 2 6 in generally favorable conditions for tropical development the depression quickly organized and attained tropical storm strength at that day based on data from reconnaissance flights and nearby ships and weather buoys as a result the tropical storm was named rita 2 7 however an increase in moderate southerly vertical wind shear as the result of a nearby upper level low subdued continued intensification and displaced convective activity to the north of center of circulation once the upper level low weakened center of circulation reformed to the north compensating for the disorganization that resulted from the wind shear consequently the tropical storm resumed its previous strengthening trend as it was steered westward across the bahamas along the south periphery of a ridge 2 8 upon entering the straits of florida on rita strengthened into a hurricane by 9 while maintaining a minimum barometric pressure of 985 mbar hpa 29.09 inhg six hours later rita intensified further into before subsequently passing approximately south of key west florida 2 aided by a favorable outflow pattern and anomalously warm sea surface temperatures ssts the trend of rapid deepening continued 9 and rita reached status upon entering the gulf of mexico by on making it a major hurricane 2 8 infrared image of hurricane rita at peak intensity on once in the gulf of mexico rita passed over the extremely warm loop current during the midday hours of enabling continued strengthening as a result the wind field significantly expanded and the barometric pressure quickly fell 2 by that day rita attained hurricane intensity 10 the highest category on the hurricane wind scale 11 favorable conditions allowed for additional development and at on rita reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of hpa making it the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the gulf of mexico at the time it was located south of the mississippi river delta rita maintained hurricane intensity for before an eyewall replacement cycle took place weakening the hurricane to intensity by on at the same time the tropical cyclone began to curve northwestward around the southwestern periphery of a ridge of high pressure over the southeastern united states as a result of the cycle a new larger eyewall consolidated resulting in wind field expanding due to wind shear and cooler continental shelf waters the hurricane continued to weaken contrary to typical tropical cyclone processes that occur after eyewall replacement cycles rita weakened to strength before making landfall at on in extreme southwestern louisiana between johnson bayou and sabine pass at the time of landfall rita was a with winds of and a barometric pressure of hpa 2 once inland on rita began to rapidly weaken 12 the tropical cyclone had been downgraded to tropical storm intensity nearly after landfall proceeding northward roughly parallel to the state border between louisiana and texas 2 radar imagery indicated that the storm soon lacked winds of tropical storm force therefore the nhc classified the system as a tropical depression while it was over arkansas by on 13 shortly before it turned northeastward ahead of an approaching frontal boundary early the next day the depression lost much of its convection over southeastern illinois and degenerated into a remnant low by that day the frontal boundary subsequently absorbed the remaining system six hours later over the southern great lakes region 2 preparations edit bahamas edit tropical storm rita over the eastern bahamas on at 0300 utc on a tropical storm warning was issued for the turks and caicos and the southeast and central bahamas at the same time a hurricane watch was also issued for the northwest bahamas by the following day the hurricane watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning for the northwest bahamas excluding grand bahama and the abaco islands which were later put under a tropical storm warning several hours later a hurricane warning was issued for exuma and andros island at the tropical storm warning for the turks and caicos was discontinued as the threat from rita diminished this discontinuation later included the southeast bahamas by on all watches and warnings for the islands were discontinued as rita moved into the gulf of mexico 2 residents in the bahamas were urged to board up their homes and stock up on emergency supplies 14 at least one shelter was opened and schools throughout the country were closed 15 the nassau international airport was also closed due to the storm on and would remain closed until the evening of 16 cuba edit officials in cuba warned residents of possible impacts from rita and closed public facilities in northern areas some evacuations took place in villages near the northern coastline and several shelters were opened 17 an estimated 150,000 people were evacuated in northern cuba ahead of the storm about 600 shelters were opened in havana which could house a total of 120,000 people in western cuba more than 42,000 were given shelter in matanzas 31,000 in villa claro and 6,300 in sancti spiritus 18 in havana power was turned off at noon on to protect transformers this also led to the disruption of natural gas lines 19 a large scale preparation was put in place by the ministry of health in cuba a total of 14,859 medical personnel were mobilized to quickly assist residents impacted by rita the personnel consisted of 3,767 doctors 5,143 nurses 2,139 specialists 1,072 health officials and 2,738 other staff members a total of 519 vehicles were also mobilized it included 241 ambulances 36 trucks 21 panels and 221 other vehicles throughout northern cuba a total of 1,486 shelters were opened most of which were filled during the evacuation 20 florida edit hurricane rita as a category 2 hurricane crossing the florida straits on when rita was declared a tropical storm phased evacuations began in the florida keys all tourists were told to evacuate the lower keys immediately and residents in mobile homes were told to prepare to evacuate 21 by mandatory evacuations were in place for the 80,000 residents of the keys both lanes on route 1 were directed northbound to speed up evacuations city busses picked up those who did not have transportation out of the keys an estimated people in miami dade county were warned about the possibility of a direct hit on miami and told to prepare to evacuate 22 a state of emergency was declared ahead of rita later that day by president george w bush this would allow federal assistance to aid the affected areas in the wake of the storm 23 throughout florida a total of 340,000 people were placed under mandatory or voluntary evacuation orders 24 five shelters were opened in southern florida with a total capacity of 4,335 people tolls

black hawk helicopters two chinook helicopters three kiowa helicopters one huron aircraft one short 360 aircraft one hercules aircraft and one metroliner aircraft was provided a task force was put on standby in homestead joint air reserve base to quickly deploy in affected areas 25 the united states department of agriculture prepared food to deliver to affected areas after rita the united states department of defense deployed personnel to coordinate evacuations the united states department of health and human services sent fully equipped medical teams and supplies if needed the united states department of homeland security pre positioned over 100 trucks of ice and packed food to deliver following rita two helicopters and one cheyenne aircraft were also provided to assist with recovery efforts the united states department of the interior shut down all national parks in florida and evacuated workers in low lying areas 26 military cargo planes evacuated hospital patients from three acute care hospitals in the keys 27 louisiana edit on tuesday sept 20th louisiana governor kathleen blanco issued a state of emergency for all parishes in the southwestern region of louisiana and

as a precaution and national guard troops and other emergency personnel in for the hurricane katrina aftermath were being mobilized to evacuate 28 select military personnel stayed in new orleans for hurricane rita including task force california 2-185 armor and 1-184 infantry 29 30 by the morning of wednesday sept 21st as strength course and speed became clearer officials of cameron parish calcasieu parish and parts of jefferson davis parish acadia parish iberia parish beauregard parish and vermillion parish began to strongly encourage residents to evacuate ahead of the storm with a 6 00 pm thursday deadline set most residents followed the recommendations of their respective officials hitting the road by the deadline though many returned home and waited until early the next morning after encountering severe traffic delays southern cameron parish residents used to frequent evacuations were gone by noon on thursday when parish officials returned to the hwy 27 gibbstown bridge that crosses the intracoastal canal into lower cameron parish two days later in preparation of damage inspection and rescue of any stranded and or injured residents no one was known to have remained 29 texas edit motorists stranded on highway 60 during hurricane rita evacuation texas governor rick perry recalled all emergency personnel including almost 1,200 texas national guard 1,100 texas state guard and several hundred texas game wardens from katrina recovery efforts in anticipation of hurricane arrival in addition the federal government deployed 11 disaster medical assistance teams dmats 31 staging them in mobile field hospitals across eastern texas the teams treated 7500 patients during the response 32 33 on september 22 governor perry and the texas department of transportation implemented a contraflow lane reversal on interstate 45 north towards dallas on interstate 10 west towards san antonio u s highway 290 northwest to austin 34 as part of the evacuation johnson space center in houston handed off control of the international space station to their russian counterparts 35 concerns had been raised over the state of the oil industry in response to rita the storm threatened a large amount of oil infrastructure that was left undamaged by katrina 36 the texas gulf coast is home to 23% of the united states refining capacity and numerous offshore production platforms were in path 37 a direct strike on houston could disable more than a quarter of the united states fuel making capacity 38 valero energy corp the largest refiner stated on september 21 that rita could have caused gasoline prices to rise well above 3 per us gallon 0 79 l at a time when the u s average price was 2 77 gal 39 mass evacuation edit just three weeks after hurricane katrina devastated the northern gulf coast the threat of yet another major hurricane prompted mass evacuations in coastal texas an estimated people fled prior to landfall 40 41 making it one of the largest evacuations in united states history 2 officials in galveston county which includes the city of galveston which was devastated by the galveston hurricane of 1900 ordered mandatory evacuations effective september 21 at 6 p m in a staggered sequence officials designated geographical zones in the area to facilitate an orderly evacuation people were scheduled to leave at different times over a 24 hour period depending on the zone in which the people were located the scheduled times were set well in advance of the possible landfall later in the week but not soon enough to ensure that all residents could evacuate safely in advance of the storm 42 nonetheless many residents remained in the county because they were either unaware of the danger of the storm or believed that it was more important to protect their belongings particularly in the wake of looting following hurricane katrina 43 the evacuation included transfer of all inpatients from the university of texas medical branch hospital to other regional hospitals 44 400 patients were prisoners under the ward of the texas department of criminal justice 45 these patients were systematically transferred to the university of texas health center at tyler 46 officials of harris county hoped that the designation of zones a b and c would help prevent bottlenecks in traffic leaving the area similar to those seen at new orleans prior to katrina and hurricane dennis earlier that year 47 also people in certain zones were to be forced to go to certain cities in texas and were not allowed to exit their designated routes except for food and another feature of the evacuation plan which officials hoped would keep traffic flow orderly the evacuation destination cities included austin college station san antonio dallas huntsville and lufkin texas evacuees were asked to try hotels in the midland odessa area when hotels began to sell out in other areas 48 on wednesday houston mayor bill white urged residents to evacuate the city telling residents wait the time for waiting is over reminding residents of the disaster in new orleans 49 after heavy traffic snarled roads leading out of town and gas shortages left numerous vehicles stranded mayor white backed off his earlier statement with if not in the evacuation zone follow the news advising people to use common sense 49 however by that afternoon the freeway system in houston was at a stand still 50 to the east of houston officials had set up evacuation routes in response to the slow evacuation of residents prior to hurricane lili 51 during the rita evacuation these preparations and their execution were overwhelmed by the enormous and unprecedented number of people fleeing from the houston area prior to the departure of local residents 42 by the time jefferson county began their mandatory evacuation local roads were already full of houstonians 52 traffic on designated evacuation routes was forced to go far slower than the speeds experienced with any previous hurricane 53 54 by late thursday 22nd morning the contraflow lanes had been ordered opened after officials determined that the highway system had become gridlocked 55 the texas department of transportation was unprepared to execute such a large scale evacuation 56 coordination and implementation of the contraflow plan took 8 to 10 hours as inbound traffic was forced to exit police were stationed to assist with traffic flow evacuees fought traffic wednesday afternoon through mid day friday moving only a fraction of the normal distance expected 42 average travel times to dallas were hours travel times to austin were hours and travel times to san antonio were hours depending on the point of departure in houston 57 many motorists ran out of gas or experienced breakdowns in temperatures that neared traffic volumes did not ease for nearly 48 hours as more than three million residents evacuated the area in advance of the storm 42 evacuation deaths edit as an estimated people evacuated the texas coastline a significant heat wave affected the region the combination of severe gridlock and excessive heat led to between 90 and 118 deaths even before the storm arrived 40 41 reports from the houston chronicle indicated 107 evacuation related fatalities texas representative garnet coleman criticized the downplay of the deaths in the evacuation and questioned whether the storm would be deadlier than the preparations 58 according to local officials the traffic reached a point where residents felt safer riding out the storm at home rather than being stuck in traffic when rita struck 40 many evacuees periodically turned off their air conditioning to reduce fuel consumption as well as drank less water to limit the number of restroom stops according to a post storm study which reported 90 evacuation related deaths nine people perished solely as a result of hyperthermia however it was suspected that most of the 67 deaths attributed to heat stress were a combination of hyperthermia and chronic health conditions 41 in addition to the heat related deaths 23 nursing home evacuees were killed after a bus caught fire on interstate 45 near wilmer 41 the bus erupted into flames after the rear axle overheated due to insufficient lubrication and ignited therapeutic oxygen tanks on board 59 according to a resident near the site of the accident there were three explosions 60 many of the passengers were mobility impaired making escape difficult or impossible 61 in june 2009 nearly four years after the fire families of those who died in the accident won an settlement against the manufacturer of the bus and the company that provided the nursing home with it 59 impact edit see also hurricane rita tornado outbreak hurricane rita rainfall in some areas the effects of hurricane rita were not nearly as severe as anticipated the storm surge feared in galveston and houston struck farther east as the center came ashore at the louisiana border winds blowing offshore in texas actually flattened the surge which was only 7 feet in galveston well below the height of the seawall the 5 inches of rain expected to fall overnight in new orleans as rita came ashore also did not happen and the pressure on the levee system was eased still a storm surge of up to 18 feet struck southwestern louisiana and coastal parishes experienced extensive damage in cameron parish the communities of holly beach hackberry cameron creole and grand chenier were essentially destroyed 62 there were also severe impacts mainly due to wind in inland parishes and counties across southwest louisiana and southeast texas respectively cities such as beaumont texas and lake charles louisiana as well as surrounding communities suffered extensive wind damage an estimated two

resulted in significant structural damage but no loss of life 19 78 in the bay shore area of havana water levels rose and inundated 20 blocks of the city 19 an estimated 400,000 people in the city lost power a result of the storm 79 in a two hour span more than 8.2 inches of rain fell in bauta 80 the torrential rains led to 34 homes collapsing in havana storm surge produced by rita penetrated an estimated inland flooding several towns 79 florida edit rita produced moderate rains across southern florida peaking at 5.13 inches in tenraw 2 a band of rain estimated to be wide produced heavier

people were without power 81 one funnel cloud was reported along interstate 95 in lake worth winds were estimated at 83 high seas from rita on flooded parts of coastal walton county moderate beach erosion also occurred as a result of the high seas damages from the flooding estimated at $200,000. 84 damages in southern florida were minimal 2 on strong rip currents produced by the remnants of rita resulted in the death of one person near miramar beach 85 louisiana edit holly beach a town along the gulf coast completely destroyed by rita with an estimated cost of in damages hurricane impact across louisiana varied one person is known to have drowned during the event 2 86 due to the storm surge which topped levees and inundated low lying coastal communities the greatest amount of damage extended across most of southern louisiana from the mississippi river delta to the sabine river widespread power outages affected roughly customers with entergy louisiana reporting the largest outage of 601,183 customers losing power 87 in southeast terrebonne parish storm surge reached flooding an estimated 10,000 homes virtually every levee was breached 88 some people were stranded in flooded communities and had to be rescued by boat at least 100 people were reported rescued from rooftops 89 already devastated by hurricane katrina the industrial canal in new orleans was again flooded by hurricane rita as the recently and hurriedly repaired levees were breached once more in south central vermilion parish storm surge reached all the way up to the communities of abbeville gueydan and lake arthur the surge completely flooded pecan island intracoastal city and delcambre 86 nearly all of the structures on pecan island were destroyed 2 rescue efforts were undertaken for up to 1,000 people stranded by local flooding on saturday september 24 alone 250 people were rescued 90 however the southwestern region of the state near where rita made landfall was undeniably the worst impacted region in louisiana 2 in cameron parish the damage was catastrophic particularly along the coastline and north to the intracoastal waterway coastal storm surge was estimated around with lower levels farther inland from the coast yet much of north western and north central cameron parish experienced significant flooding the southern cameron parish communities of cameron creole grand chenier holly beach johnson bayou little chenier and oak grove were either heavily devastated or entirely wiped out by the storm surge with nearly 95 percent of homes businesses and infrastructure completely destroyed closer to the intracoastal waterway communities shared a similar fate big lake deatonville gibbstown and hackberry were all devastated or heavily damaged in hackberry an unofficial wind gust of was recorded on a boat tied up to a local dock above the intracoastal waterway in northern cameron parish damage was devastating with the communities of grand lake camp lowry pelican point and sweetlake suffering from extensive flooding and wind damage over a decade later many communities south of the intracoastal waterway are still recovering with their populations significantly lower than pre rita levels to the north in calcasieu parish the cities and communities of iowa lake charles moss bluff sulphur and westlake suffered severe wind damage and some areas also received flooding due to both storm surge and heavy rain in lake charles the storm surge that traveled up the calcasieu ship channel from the coast was estimated to be up to a casino boat secured at the north end of the lake and several barges secured at the port of lake charles broke free from their moorings floating loose until running into the interstate 10 bridge over the calcasieu river causing minor damage other areas of lake charles also experienced severe flooding with reports of water rising at one point inundating the lower floors of the lake charles civic center at a hotel on a section of the contraband bayou near interstate 210 and prien lake road water reportedly rose as high as the second floor there was extensive minor to major structural wind damage across the entire area including the near devastation of the lake charles regional airport south of the city 91 damage to the entire electrical and communications infrastructure was severe and authorities warned returning residents that restoration of services to some areas would take weeks to months holly beach was almost completely leveled by storm surge in the western calcasieu parish communities of vinton and starks wind damage was also severe the roof was torn off of the vinton recreation center and many homes were damaged by fallen trees and utility poles damaged utility towers made power restoration problematic with much of the area waiting months for utilities to be restored allen beauregard jeff davis and vernon parishes suffered lesser yet still significant degrees of wind damage and flooding damage due to heavy rain after weakening to a tropical storm rita entered desoto and caddo parishes the center passed just west of downtown shreveport before crossing the arkansas border at the height of the storm over 175,000 people had lost power in the national weather service forecast area mainly across deep east texas into northwest louisiana two fatalities occurred in the ark la tex a tree fell on
