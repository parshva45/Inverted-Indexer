december 2006 at 20 47 35 est a previous launch attempt on 7 december had been canceled due to cloud cover it was the first night launch of a space shuttle since sts 113 in november 2002 4 the mission is also referred to as iss 12a 1 by the iss program the main goals of the mission were delivery and attachment of the international space p5 truss segment a major rewiring of the power system and exchange of iss expedition 14 personnel the shuttle landed at 17 32 est on 22 december 2006 at kennedy space center 98 minutes off schedule due to unfavorable weather conditions this mission was particularly notable to sweden being the first spaceflight of a scandinavian astronaut christer fuglesang sts 116 was the final scheduled space shuttle launch from pad 39b as nasa reconfigured it for ares i launches 5 the only remaining use of pad 39b by the shuttle was as a reserve for the sts 400 launch on need mission to rescue the crew of sts 125 the final hubble space telescope servicing

115 to rotate and track the sun sts 116 was the last sts mission scheduled for launch from pad 39b the pad will be refitted for upcoming ares i launches 5 the crew of sts 116 consisted of five rookie astronauts only mission commander mark polansky 2 and mission specialist robert curbeam 3 had previously flown in space robert curbeam became the first astronaut to make four evas during the same mission 11 this was the first mission with two african american crewmembers mission notes edit as one of the main goals of sts 116 was to exchange iss expedition 14 crew members the crew of sts 116 changed mid flight iss flight engineer sunita suni williams was part of the sts 116 crew for the first portion of the mission she then replaced iss flight engineer thomas reiter on the expedition 14 crew and reiter joined the sts 116 crew for the return to earth final assembly power converter unit mission for discovery edit during planned orbiter upgrades that took place subsequent to this mission discovery s assembly power converter units apcus were removed and replaced with the shuttle side components of the station shuttle power transfer system sspts the apcus converted 28vdc orbiter main bus power to 124vdc compatible with the 120vdc main bus power during initial station assembly missions orbiter apcu power was used to augment the power available from the russian service segment with the operation of permanent main electrical systems e g p4 array and sarj mbsus ddcus ammonia cooling systems orbiter power was no longer needed by the iss after sts 118 discovery and endeavour drew power from the iss although atlantis was never upgraded with the sspts this system slowed the orbiters consumption of hydrogen and oxygen used by their onboard electricity generating fuel cells the hydrogen and oxygen supplies stored cryogenically in tanks aboard the orbiter limited the duration of space shuttle missions as a result of the changeover to sspts discovery and endeavour gained approximately 50% of the time that would have been spent docked otherwise this resulted in extra days for each iss docked mission 12 13 14 15 16 17 mission payloads edit in the space station

november 2006 nasa announced that the launch team had been asked to aim for a launch on 7 december 2006 rather than the original target date of 14 december the launch window for the sts 116 mission opened on 7 december and extended through 17 december the seven member flight crew arrived for launch at shuttle landing facility on 3 december 2006 in the afternoon 18 primary payloads on the 13 day mission were the p5 integrated truss segment spacehab single logistics module and an integrated cargo carrier the sts 116 mission was the 20th shuttle flight to the station launch on the new earlier date required a night time launch subsequent to the columbia disaster nasa had imposed rules requiring shuttle launches to be conducted during the day when light would be sufficient for cameras to observe falling debris with the redesign of shuttle tank foam having minimized the amount of falling debris and the availability of in orbit inspection procedures the daylight launch requirement was relaxed 19 rollover of discovery to the vehicle assembly building vab occurred on 31 october and on 1 november the orbiter was raised into a vertical orientation and moved into high bay 3 to be mated with the external tank and solid rocket boosters rollout to launch complex 39b was completed on thursday 11 november the crew for the mission arrived at kennedy space center on 13 november to begin their final four day prelaunch training for the mission which included familiarization activities rehearsal of emergency procedures and practice on shuttle training aircraft along with a simulated countdown which took place on the morning of 16 november 2006 the astronauts then traveled to johnson space center in houston texas and returned to kennedy space center on 3 december 2006 four days before the planned launch date the payloads for the mission including a spacehab module and the p5 truss were loaded from the payload canister into payload bay on 16 november and with the sealing of the payload bay doors all that remained was to fill the external fuel tank before the discovery shuttle stack was in full launch configuration with the completion of the flight readiness review over november which evaluated all activities and elements necessary for the safe and successful performance of the shuttle during the mission including the orbiter itself the payload and flight crew discovery was given her certificate of flight readiness the launch date was officially set to 7 december 2006 and the mission officially given the go for launch mission timeline edit 7 december launch attempt 1 edit sts 116 crew about to board the astrovan for the trip to pad 39b following the completion of the pre launch preparations all eyes were on the florida skies due to a forecast low cloud ceiling for the night of the launch the seven astronauts were loaded into discovery ready for the scheduled launch at 21 37 est with hopes high for a break in the clouds but as the scheduled launch time approached it became apparent that the cloud would not break and the launch attempt was scrubbed with the next attempt scheduled for 9 december 2006 20 prior to the initial attempt on 7 december

positively in the hours approaching the launch window saturday night the fueling process for external tanks began at 12 46 est 17 46 utc and was completed at approximately 15 45 est 20 45 utc if a transatlantic abort landing tal had been required during ascent the shuttle had three possible landing sites zaragoza or air base in spain or istres france 23 the launch was the third shuttle mission in five months being preceded by sts 121 in july and sts 115 in september and was the first night launch in four years since sts 113 and first night launch following the columbia accident during sts 107 10 december flight day 2 edit flight day 2 began for the astronauts at 15 47 utc the first order of business for the day was a thorough inspection of the shuttle using sensors and cameras attached to a fifty foot boom which was in turn connected to a fifty foot robotic arm nicholas patrick inspected the leading edge of the wings and the nose cap the process which took five and a half hours suffered a minor glitch that required patrick to order the arm to manually grab the boom during this time the crew also inspected the upper surface of the orbiter 24 astronauts also completed a check of the spacesuits to be used during the mission along with preparation for docking with the international space station as seen through windows on the aft flight deck of space shuttle discovery the payload bay is featured in this image photographed by a sts 116 crewmember 11 december flight day 3 docking to iss edit flight day 3 began for the astronauts at 15 18 utc following the rendezvous pitch maneuver docking to the international space station occurred at 22 12 utc the hatch between the international space station and discovery was opened at 23 54 utc 25 the joint iss shuttle crew then worked to undertake some further detailed inspection of the orbiter and unloaded the p5 truss segment from the payload bay handing it off successfully from the shuttle robotic arm to the station arm the astronauts scheduled for day eva robert curbeam and christer fuglesang ended their day by entering the airlock for a campout sleep session to prepare for the eva by purging their bodies of nitrogen in a lower pressure environment 26 such a practice is common in order for the astronauts to avoid getting decompression sickness 12 december flight day 4 eva 1 edit space shuttle discovery s canadarm 1 robotic arm hands off the p5 truss section to the international space canadarm 2 during shuttle mission sts 116 in december 2006 while flying over new zealand robert l curbeam jr and christer fuglesang participate in the first spacewalk flight day 4 began for the astronauts at 15 47 utc 27 during the first eva of the mission the astronauts of sts 116 brought the iss one step closer to completion with the addition of the p5 truss segment the eva began at 20 31 utc with curbeam and fuglesang removing launch restraints from the p5 truss and mission specialist joan higginbotham making use of the robotic arm the canadarm2 to move the truss segment to within inches of its new position on the p4 truss the spacewalkers then guided higginbotham with visual cues as the precise operation to finalize the attachment of the truss was completed 28 after the attachment curbeam and fuglesang finalized the installation with power data and heater cable connections they also replaced a faulty video camera attached to the s1 truss since they worked ahead of the time line the two astronauts were also able to complete some get ahead tasks at the end of the spacewalk curbeam congratulated the nobel prize winners including scientist dr john c mather at goddard space flight center in greenbelt maryland 29 mather was honored for his work on the big bang theory christer fuglesang also held a short speech in swedish encouraging swedes and others to aspire to become future astronauts the eva concluded at 03 07 utc on the morning of 13 december and lasted for 6 hours and 36 minutes in total 29 during the spacewalk after taking a close look at imagery gathered on the first three days of the flight mission managers determined that the heat shield would support a safe return to earth they also decided a more detailed inspection that had been scheduled for later in the mission would not be necessary three more spacewalks one of which was unplanned were required to reconfigure and redistribute power on the station so that the solar arrays installed during sts 115 could be used the first step of reconfiguring the power took place wednesday when the port solar array on the p6 truss will be retracted which allowed the activation and rotation of the solar alpha rotary joint on the p4 the rotary joint allows the solar arrays on the p4 to track the sun the astronauts were required to spend the night sleeping in protected areas in order to avoid radiation from a solar flare eruption 30 13 december flight day 5 solar array reorganization edit a kink that occurred in the port side p6 solar array during the first attempt to retract that array on 13 december flight day 5 began for the astronauts at 15 21 utc 31 the most high profile activity was the attempted retraction of the p6 port side solar array the process began at 18 28 utc but problems with the array folding due to kinks and billows led the controllers to redeploy the array from about 40% retracted there then followed a series of more than 40 commands to furl and unfurl the arrays in an effort to get them properly aligned and folded at 00 50 utc the retraction efforts were abandoned for the day the problems which appear to have been caused by a loss of tension in the solar array guide wires 32 had still not been solved although 14 of the 31 bays on the array had been retracted leaving 17 bays extended this was enough to leave the port side arrays in a safe position to commence the activation of the solar alpha rotary joint sarj at 01 00 utc allowing the solar arrays on the p3 p4 truss to rotate to follow the sun 33 14 december flight day 6 eva 2 edit christer fuglesang participates in the second session of extravehicular activity flight day 6 began for the astronauts at 15 19 utc the primary activity eva no 2 began rewiring work to bring the permanent electrical power systems into use to allow this changeover station controllers had to power down about half the systems on the iss the eva started at 19 41 utc with bob curbeam and christer fuglesang exiting the quest airlock 30 minutes early eva no 2 was planned to activate channels 2 and 3 of the four channel electrical system and the work progressed smoothly about two hours into the spacewalk the first current was flowing through the reconfigured system using the power from the p4 solar arrays for the first time the eva was completed in exactly 5 hours finishing at 00 41 utc 34 15 december flight day 7 edit crew photo flight day 7 was a light work day for the crews of discovery and the iss after the previous days activities spacewalkers bob curbeam and christer fuglesang enjoyed some r r while the rest of the crew performed cleanup and preparatory tasks for flight day planned eva 3 the traditional joint photo session and joint news conference were held by the crews 35 during this event swedish first time astronaut christer fuglesang was interviewed by crown princess victoria and also set a 20 second frisbee world record in space broadcast live on swedish tv4 36 37 in an attempt to free a stuck solar panel thomas reiter exercised vigorously on a machine which is known to cause oscillations in the solar arrays it was not successful mission controllers continued to look at other solutions to the solar panel folding problem so as to enable complete retraction including an extended or additional eva 38 16 december flight day 8 eva 3 edit astronaut robert l curbeam jr sts 116 mission specialist works with the port overhead solar array wing on the international space p6 truss during the fourth session of extravehicular activity flight day 8 began for the astronauts at 14 48 utc astronauts bob curbeam and suni williams completed the rewiring work on the international space station the eva began at 19 25 utc and proceeded normally as an add on task to the eva astronauts curbeam and williams also continued work on the retraction of a sticking solar array enabling the retraction of another six sections of the p6 array at the end of the eva there were another 11 bays or 35% left to retract upon completion of the eva the astronauts returned to the iss via the quest airlock 39 another significant event during the eva was the loss of suni williams digital camera at the post eva press conference it was suggested that a tether got snagged and caused the camera release button to break off allowing the camera to fall out of its holder images were lost but it was determined there was no need to retake them curbeam later said to the mcc got the bracket and the tether looks like the screws on the bracket came loose we have the screws and the bracket and the tether 40 17 december flight day 9 edit flight deck of discovery flight day 9 was mainly spent preparing for eva 4 the space suits were prepared adjusting sizes and replacing lioh canisters and the crew went through the new procedures which had been developed for attempting to enable the solar array retraction various tools were to be coated in kapton tape to protect the array from coming into direct contact with sharp metallic objects and to provide electrical insulation if they are used to manipulate the arrays during the eva 40 41 18 december flight day 10 eva 4 edit flight day 10 began for the astronauts at 14 17 utc 39 bob curbeam and christer fuglesang embarked on an added eva at 17 12 utc to try to fully close the last eleven bays of the balky p6 port solar array wing 42 the rapidly planned eva was successfully completed after a 6 hour 38 minute spacewalk 43 at the end of eva no 4 curbeam ranked fifth in total eva time for u s astronauts and 14th overall 44 19 december flight day 11 undocking edit as seen through windows on

measure the density and composition of the low earth orbit atmosphere in order to help better predict the movements of objects in orbit but one of the satellites failed to emerge from its launch canister ande is currently transmitting data and emerged from the canister approximately 30 minutes after its launch according to satellite tracking data 22 december flight day 14 landing edit sts 116 landing at ksc discovery following the landing chute deployment flight day 14 began for the astronauts at 12 17 utc preparations for landing were complete high cross winds precluded a landing at edwards air force base while clouds and showers were an issue at kennedy space center shuttle landing facility on the first orbit that combination raised the possibility of the first landing at white sands space harbor since sts 3 in 1982 39 had landing taken place at white sands it could have taken as long as 60 days to return the orbiter to kennedy space center the first landing opportunity at kennedy space center was abandoned due to unfavorable weather conditions however at 21 00 utc coordinates were sent to the shuttle to re attempt a landing at kennedy along runway 15 as the first contingency landing attempt at edwards had been scrubbed due to high cross winds the de orbit burn for kennedy occurred at 21 27 utc having been authorized at 21 23 utc and was finished at 21 31 utc
