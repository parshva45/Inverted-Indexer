last day of the atlantic hurricane season a stationary front extended across eastern cuba into the southwestern caribbean sea on december 1 a low pressure area developed within the frontal zone just north of panama 1 and an anticyclone aloft produced good outflow over the low level center 2 the low remained nearly stationary for the next several days and it gradually became separated from the stationary front 1 convection increased across the area due to moisture from the eastern pacific ocean and moderate divergence 3 increased wind shear deteriorated the system on december 2 4 though convection redeveloped as the system started a northeast drift 5 on december 3 a mid level circulation developed about north of the surface center convection increased and became better organized as a weak tropical wave reached the area and it is estimated the system developed into tropical depression twenty at around 1200 utc on december 4 while located about south of kingston jamaica 1 initially the depression was forecast to track north northeastward and pass over western haiti 6 tropical storm odette shortly after being named on december 4 upon being classified as a tropical cyclone the depression was embedded within the southwesterly flow between a ridge over the eastern caribbean sea and a mid latitude trough which caused a steady east northeast motion 6 the convection organized into a central dense overcast with a well defined cloud band wrapping partially around the center and based on satellite imagery estimates the depression was upgraded to tropical storm status late on december 4 the national hurricane center named the storm odette 7 after being named the storm intensified despite moderate southwesterly wind shear and an eye feature became evident on microwave satellite imagery 1 additionally about of a mid level eyewall developed 8 the storm was assessed with winds of though the national hurricane center remarked the winds could have been stronger due to lack of structural data the eye feature diminished as the convective structure deteriorated slightly and hurricane hunters first flew into the storm at around on december 5 1 odette tracked over an area of warm sea surface temperatures 8 and the overall cloud pattern gradually improved 9 the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory predicted the storm to attain hurricane status 10 early on december 6 a trmm overpass showed an 80% closed eyewall 11 and at odette attained peak winds of while located about southwest of santo domingo dominican republic 1 upon reaching peak intensity odette had begun accelerating northeastward which decreased wind shear and slightly increased its southwesterly outflow 11 the low level center decelerated as it approached hispaniola though the convection continued quickly northeastward failing to maintain vertical organization odette weakened slightly and made landfall on jaragua national park in the pedernales province of the dominican republic around on december 6 with winds of the circulation became disrupted as it crossed the country and on december 7 it emerged into the atlantic ocean with winds of 1 it accelerated to the northeast ahead of an approaching cold front and late on december 7 odette transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as its center became embedded within the front the remnants continued quickly northeastward before losing its identity within the frontal zone on december 9 1 the frontal zone that absorbed odette also absorbed tropical storm peter a few days later 12 preparations edit prior to predicted arrival
