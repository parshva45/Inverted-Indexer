upper class achaot middle class and lower class 13 the matua were located in the coastal villages which meant they had the best access to fishing grounds whereas the were located in the interior of the island matua and rarely communicated with each other and matua often used achaot as intermediaries there were also similar to shamans skilled in healing and medicine belief in spirits of ancient chamorros called taotao still persists as a remnant of pre european culture their society was organized along matrilineal clans 13 21 latte stones are stone pillars that are found only in the mariana islands they are a recent development in pre contact chamorro society the latte stone was used as a foundation on which thatched huts were built 13 26 latte stones consist of a base shaped from

his circumnavigation of the globe 13 when magellan arrived on guam he was greeted by hundreds of small outrigger canoes that appeared to be flying over the water due to their considerable speed these outrigger canoes were called proas and resulted in magellan naming guam islas de las velas latinas islands of the lateen sails antonio pigafetta one of original 18 said that the name was island of sails but he also writes that the inhabitants entered the ships and stole whatever they could lay their hands on including the small boat that was fastened to the poop of the flagship 14 129 those

both guam and the northern marianas have many similarities with spanish culture due to three centuries of spanish rule 5 internal conflicts edit intermittent warfare lasting from july 23 1670 until july 1695 plus the typhoons of 1671 and 1693 and in particular the smallpox epidemic of 1688 reduced the chamorro population from 50,000 to 10,000 to less than 5,000 13 86 precipitated by the death of quipuha and the murder of father san vitores and pedro calungsod by local rebel chief matapang tensions led to a number of conflicts captain juan de santiago started a campaign to conquer the island which was continued by the successive commanders of the spanish forces 13 after his arrival in 1674 captain damian de esplana ordered the arrest of rebels who attacked the population of certain towns hostilities eventually led to the destruction of villages such as chochogo pepura tumon sidia aty sagua nagan and ninca 13 starting in june 1676 the first spanish governor of guam capt francisco de

culture is a combination of american spanish filipino other micronesian islander and mexican traditions few indigenous pre hispanic customs remained following spanish contact hispanic influences are manifested in the local language music dance sea navigation cuisine fishing games such as batu chonka estuleks and bayogu songs and fashion during spanish colonial rule the majority of the population was converted to roman catholicism and religious festivities such as easter and christmas became widespread post contact chamorro cuisine is largely based on corn and includes tortillas tamales atole and chilaquiles which are a clear influence from mesoamerica principally mexico from spanish trade with asia the modern chamorro language has many historical parallels to modern philippine languages in that it is an austronesian language which has absorbed much spanish vocabulary it is a malayo polynesian language along with such languages as tagalog indonesian hawaiian and even maori despite being spoken in the mid pacific ocean which is geographically closer to speakers of the polynesian islands chamorro is actually an outlier of the languages subgroup chamorro is thus more closely related to and a part of the languages of the malay archipelago rather than its neighbours in polynesia among the languages of malay archipelago chamorro is most closely related to the languages in the south of the chain of islands within indonesia rather than the languages of the north in the philippines with which it shares linguistic spanish colonial influence also like filipinos many chamorros possess spanish surnames despite few of the inhabitants actually descending from the spanish colonisers spanish names and surnames were adopted after their conversion to roman catholic christianity in a phenomenon prompted by the imposition of the de apellidos in guam and other territories of the spanish east indies most notably the philippines due to foreign cultural influence from spain most aspects of the early indigenous culture have been lost though there has been a resurgence in preserving any remaining pre hispanic culture in the last few decades some scholars have traveled throughout the pacific islands conducting research to study what the original chamorro cultural practices such as dance language and canoe building may have been like puntan dos amantes two

system of reciprocity at the heart of chamorro society it is rooted in the core value of historian lawrence cunningham in 1992 wrote in a chamorro sense the land and its produce belong to everyone or interdependence is the key or central value in chamorro depends on a spirit of cooperation and sharing this is the armature or core that everything in chamorro culture revolves around it is a powerful concern for mutuality rather than individualism and private property rights the core culture or pengngan chamorro is based on complex social protocol centered upon respect from sniffing over the hands of the elders called mangnginge in chamorro the passing down of legends chants and courtship rituals to a person asking for permission from spiritual ancestors before entering a jungle or ancient battle grounds other practices predating spanish conquest include galaide canoe making making of the belembaotuyan a string musical instrument made from a gourd fashioning of atupat slings and

combs made from tortoise shells and spondylus the cosmopolitan and multicultural nature of modern guam poses challenges for chamorros struggling to preserve their culture and identity amidst forces of acculturation the increasing numbers of chamorros especially chamorro youth relocating to the u s mainland has further complicated both definition and preservation of chamorro identity citation needed

political status edit in the 1980s and early 1990s there was a significant movement in favor of this u s territory becoming a commonwealth which would give it a level of self government similar to puerto rico and the northern mariana islands however the federal government rejected the version of a commonwealth that the government of guam proposed because its clauses were incompatible with the territorial clause art iv sec 3 cl 2 of the u s constitution other movements advocate u s statehood for guam union with the state of hawaii or union with the northern mariana islands as a single territory or independence 42 in a 1982 plebiscite voters indicated interest in seeking commonwealth status citation needed the island has been considering another non binding plebiscite on

seminar in may 2016 we are hopeful that this might indicate a shift in united states policy to its non self governing territories such as guam where they will be more willing to engage in discussions

and moving 8,600 marines and 9,000 of their dependents to guam from okinawa japan including the required construction workers this buildup would increase population by 45 in a february 2010 letter the united states environmental protection agency sharply criticized these plans because of a water shortfall sewage problems and the impact on coral reefs 48 by 2012 these plans had been cut to have only a maximum of 4,800 marines stationed on the island two thirds of whom would be there on a rotational basis without their dependents 49 with the proposed increased military presence stemming from the upcoming preparation efforts and relocation efforts of u s marines from okinawa japan to guam slated to begin in 2010 and last for the next several years thereafter the amount of total land that the military will control or tenant may grow to or surpass 40% of the entire landmass of guam in january 2011 the ike skelton national defense authorization act for fy2011 indicated that recent

and the united states october 1935 in 1899 the local postage stamps were overprinted guam as was done for the other former spanish colonies but this was discontinued shortly thereafter and regular u s postage stamps have been used ever since because guam is also part of the u s postal system postal abbreviation gu zip code range mail to guam from the u s mainland is considered domestic and no additional charges are required private shipping companies such as fedex ups and dhl however have no obligation to do so and do not regard guam as domestic the speed of mail traveling between guam and the states varies depending on size and time of year light first class items generally take less than a week to or from the mainland but larger first class or priority items can take a week or two fourth class mail such as magazines are transported by sea after reaching hawaii most residents use post office boxes or private mail boxes although residential delivery is becoming increasingly available incoming mail not from the americas should be addressed to guam instead of usa to avoid being routed the long way through the u s mainland and possibly charged a higher rate especially from asia the commercial port of guam is the lifeline because most products must be shipped into guam for consumers it receives the weekly calls of the hawaii based shipping line matson inc whose container ships connect guam with honolulu hawaii los angeles california oakland california and seattle washington the port is also the regional transhipment hub for over 500,000 customers throughout the

and eventually the third marine expeditionary force guam is served by the antonio b won pat international airport which is a hub for united airlines the island is outside the united states customs

due to the guam and cnmi visa waiver program for certain countries an eligibility pre clearance check is carried on guam for flights to the states for travel from the northern mariana islands to guam

system guam regional transit authority and some commercial companies operate buses between tourist frequented locations ecology edit brown tree snake edit brown tree snake believed to be a stowaway on a u s military transport near the end of world war ii the brown tree snake boiga irregularis was accidentally introduced to guam which previously had no native species of snake it nearly eliminated the native bird population the problem was exacerbated because the snake has no natural predators on the island the brown tree snake known locally as the kulebla is native to northern and eastern coasts of australia papua new guinea and the solomon islands it is slightly venomous but relatively harmless to human beings it is nocturnal although some studies have suggested a high density of these serpents on guam residents rarely see them the united states department of agriculture has trained detector dogs to keep the snakes out of the cargo flow the united states geological survey also has dogs that can detect snakes in forested environments around the islands 51 52 before the introduction of the brown tree snake guam was home to several endemic bird species among them were the guam rail or bird in chamorro and the guam flycatcher both common throughout the island today the flycatcher is entirely extinct and the guam rail is extinct in the wild but bred in captivity by the division of aquatic and wildlife resources the devastation caused by the snake has been significant over the past several decades as many as twelve bird species are believed to have been driven to extinction 53 according to many elders birds were common in guam before world war ii 54 other bird species threatened by the brown tree snake include the mariana crow the mariana swiftlet and the micronesian starling though populations are present on other islands including rota 53 guam is said to have many more insects and 40 times more spiders than neighboring islands because their natural predators birds are severely diminished and the forests are almost completely silent due to lack of birdsong 55 56 1 2 forest on guam swathed in spider webs coconut rhinoceros beetle edit coconut

carabao obstruct military base operations and harm native ecosystems after birth control and adoption efforts were ineffective the u s military began culling the herds in 2002 leading to organized protests from island residents 57 other introduced species include cane toads imported in 1937 the giant african snail an agricultural pest introduced during world by japanese occupation troops and more recently frog species which could threaten crops in addition to providing additional food for the brown tree snake population reports of loud chirping frogs native to puerto rico and known as that may have arrived from hawaii have led to fears that the noise could threaten tourism 58 guam has no native amphibian species but now a total of eight amphibian species has been established in guam litoria fallax native to the eastern coast of australia has been present in guam since 1968 and rhinella marina the cane toad was brought to the island in 1937 the other 6 amphibian species namely hylarana guentheri native to mainland asia microhyla pulchra native to mainland asia polypedates braueri endemic to taiwan eleutherodactylus planirostris native to the caribbean fejervarya cancrivora the guam variety being most closely related to f cancrivora found in taiwan and fejervarya limnocharis native to southeast asia have been in guam since 2003 59 many species were likely inadvertently introduced via shipping cargo especially from taiwan mainland china and southeast asia introduced feral pigs and deer over hunting and habitat loss from human development are also major factors in the decline and loss of native plants and animals threats to indigenous plants edit invading animal species are not the only threat to native flora tinangaja a virus affecting coconut palms was first observed on the island in 1917 when copra production was still a major part of economy though coconut plantations no longer exist on the island the dead and infected trees that have resulted from the epidemic are seen throughout the forests of guam 60 during the past century the dense forests of northern guam have been largely replaced by thick tangan tangan brush leucaena leucocephala much of foliage was lost during world war ii in 1947 the u s military is thought to have planted tangan tangan by seeding the island from the air to prevent erosion tangan tangan was present on the island before 1905 61 in southern guam non native grass species dominate much of the landscape although the colorful and impressive flame tree delonix regia is found throughout the marianas the tree on guam has been largely decimated wildfires edit grassland wildfires plague the forested areas of guam every dry season despite the humid climate most fires are caused by humans with 80% resulting from arson 62 poachers often start fires to attract deer to the new growth invasive grass species that rely on fire as part of their natural life cycle grow in many regularly burned areas grasslands and barrens have replaced previously forested areas leading to greater soil erosion during the rainy season sediment is carried by the heavy rains into the fena lake reservoir and ugum river leading to water quality problems for southern guam eroded silt also destroys the marine life in reefs around the island soil stabilization efforts by volunteers and forestry workers planting trees have had little success in preserving natural habitats 63 aquatic preserves edit having previously experienced extensive dredging tumon bay is now a marine wildlife preserve efforts have been made to protect coral reef habitats from pollution eroded silt and overfishing problems that have led to decreased fish populations since guam is a significant vacation spot for scuba divers this is important in recent years the department of agriculture division of aquatic and wildlife resources has established several new marine preserves where fish populations are monitored by biologists 64 before adopting u s environmental protection agency standards portions of tumon bay were dredged by the hotel chains to provide a better experience for hotel guests 65 66 tumon bay has since been made into a preserve a federal guam national wildlife refuge in northern guam protects the decimated sea turtle population in addition to a small colony of mariana fruit bats 67 harvest of sea turtle eggs was a common occurrence on guam before world war ii the green sea turtle chelonia mydas was harvested legally on guam before august 1978 when it was listed as threatened under the endangered species act the hawksbill sea turtle eretmochelys imbricata has been on the endangered list since 1970 in an effort to ensure protection of sea turtles on guam routine sightings are counted during aerial surveys and
