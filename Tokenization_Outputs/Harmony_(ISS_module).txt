harmony iss module wikipedia harmony iss module from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search node 2 shown connected to columbus jem pma 2 and destiny the nadir and zenith locations are open harmony also known as node 2 is the utility hub of the international space station the hub contains four racks that provide electrical power plus electronic data and act as a central connecting point for several other components via its six common berthing mechanisms cbms harmony added 2,666 cubic feet 3 to the living volume an increase of almost 20 percent from 3 to 3 the successful installation of harmony meant that from nasa s perspective the station was u s core complete harmony was successfully launched into space aboard space shuttle flight sts 120 on october 23 2007 1 2 after temporarily being attached to the port side of the unity node 3 4 it was moved to its permanent location on the forward end of the destiny laboratory on november 14 2007 5 contents 1

known as node 2 was renamed harmony in march 2007 6 the name was chosen from a competition involving more than 2,200 kindergarten through high school students from 32 us states 7 8 the node 2 challenge required students to learn about the space station build a scale model and write an essay explaining their proposed name for the module which will serve as a central hub for science labs specifications edit crew members hanging out of the usos crew quarters harmony under assembly weighing approximately 14,288 kilograms harmony is the second of three node module on usos 7 the design is based on the existing multi purpose logistics module as well as the european space agency s columbus module 7 there are six common berthing mechanisms cbms on harmony the one that connects it to destiny is passive the rest are active 9 harmony is managed by marshall space flight center in huntsville alabama its deployment expanded the space station allowing it to grow from the size of a three bedroom house to the space equivalent of a typical five bedroom house once the japanese and european columbus laboratories are attached the space station robotic arm canadarm2 is able to operate from a powered grapple fixture on the exterior of harmony 10 after the cancellation of the habitation module harmony was chosen to house the american crew quarters 11 12 the first two were delivered on sts 126 and the second two on sts 128 13 14 the node measures 7.2 metres in length and it has a diameter of 4.4 metres construction agreement edit in an agreement between nasa and the european space agency the rome based company thales alenia space built harmony at its facility in turin italy 10 harmony arrived on june 1 2003 at the kennedy space center in florida after its flight in an airbus beluga oversize cargo vehicle following post transportation inspection the italian space agency formally handed over harmony to the european space agency esa from there esa formally transferred ownership of harmony to nasa on june 18 2003 taking place in the space station processing facility of the kennedy space center 15 the handover of harmony completed a major element of the barter agreement between esa and nasa that was signed in turin on october 8 1997 15 paolo a nespoli an esa astronaut born in milan italy accompanied the harmony module aboard sts 120 as a mission specialist launch edit graphic showing the six cbms on harmony harmony was launched october 23 2007 aboard sts 120 as the primary component of assembly mission iss 10a 16 17 18 on october 26 the space station remote manipulator system ssrms removed harmony from the shuttle cargo bay and temporarily mated it to the port side of unity and on october 27 the crew entered harmony 3 19 after the space shuttle departed harmony was relocated to the forward dock of the destiny laboratory it required three evas by the station crew to complete the installation 19 20 connecting modules and visiting vehicles edit harmony inside the payload bay of space shuttle discovery while on its way to the iss harmony was the first permanent living space enlargement to the iss after the pirs docking compartment was added in 2001 the expedition 16 crew moved the pressurized mating adapter pma 2 on november 12 2007 from the destiny laboratory to the forward berth of harmony the combined pma 2 harmony unit was subsequently berthed to its final destination at the forward end of the destiny laboratory on november 14 2007 5 all the following space shuttle missions would be docked to this location on february 11 2008 columbus laboratory was attached to the starboard hatch of the harmony module during space shuttle mission sts 122 on march 14 2008 the experiment logistics module pressurized section elm ps of was attached to its interim location the zenith hatch of harmony during sts 124 a space shuttle mission flown by space shuttle discovery the pressurized module of was added to the port side of harmony and the elm ps was moved leaving the zenith hatch empty the zenith hatch was originally intended to be the permanent docking connector for the now canceled centrifuge accommodations module cam when the space shuttle flew the multi purpose logistics modules mplms to the station the mplm would be temporarily berthed to the nadir mechanism of harmony 21 the japanese h ii transfer vehicle and
