international docking adapter wikipedia international docking adapter from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search ida 2 upright ida 1 upright the international docking adapter ida is a spacecraft docking system adapter being developed to convert apas 95 to the nasa docking system nds international docking system standard idss an ida will be placed on each of the international space iss two open pressurized mating adapters pma both of which will be connected to node 2 harmony module contents 1 history 1.1 apas to lids adaptor system 1.2 common docking adapter 2 design 3 deployment of ida modules 3.1 ida 1 3.2 ida 2 3.3 ida 3 4 gallery 5 see also 6 references history edit prior to ida there were several different iterations of docking adapters that were meant to fill a similar role but were ultimately canceled apas to lids adaptor system edit the apas to lids adaptor system atlas was announced in 2008 1 it would have been placed on the open pmas and converted apas 95 to the low impact docking system lids 1 atlas was planned to be launched on first two missions to the international space station 1 missions to the iss were later canceled altogether and its role as a crew transporter was replaced by the commercial crew program 2 common docking adapter edit rendering of the now cancelled common docking adapter the common docking adapter cda was announced in 2009 3 it was planned to be used to convert the common berthing mechanism to the nasa docking system 4 the cdas would have been attached directly to node 2 forward and node 2 zenith 4 they would have been delivered on the japanese htv cargo spacecraft 4 design edit ida converts apas 95 to the nasa docking system which complies with the international docking system standard and allows the transfer of crew cargo power and data 5 ida has a mass of a height of and a width of 5 6 when including the docking targets laser retro reflectors and related systems that are arrayed around the outer perimeters the outer diameter is about 5 boeing is the primary contractor for the idas and the adapters were assembled at their houston product support center 7 8 parts from subcontractors came from 25 american states and the primary structure is from russian company rsc energia 5 8 deployment of ida modules edit when each ida arrives dextre removes it from trunk and moves it to about from the front of the pma it then moves the ida carefully into position until it is seated on the pma and holds it there 8 astronauts during an extravehicular activity then complete the electrical connections and permanently connect it to the pma 8 ida 1 was planned to be attached to forward pma 9 ida 2 was originally planned to be attached to zenith pma 9 10 but following the loss of ida 1 ida 2 was instead attached to forward pma pma 2 11 12 ida 3 a replacement for ida 1 is planned to be installed at zenith pma pma 3 11 ida 1 edit ida 1 with micrometeorite cover in feb 2015 ida 1 had been transported to the kennedy space center while ida 2 was still at houston facility 8 the systems and targets for ida 1 were put through about a month of tests at the space station processing facility before being loaded for launch 5 ida 1 was lost during the launch failure of spacex crs 7 on june 28 2015 9 10 13 ida 2 edit ida 2 without micrometeorite cover ida 2 was launched on spacex crs 9 on 18 july 2016 14 it was attached and connected to pma 2 during a spacewalk on 19 august 2016 12 ida 3 edit ida 3 is scheduled to be launched on the spacex crs 16 mission during summer 2018 11 15 ida 3 is being built mostly from spare parts to speed construction 15 gallery edit rendering of ida connected to a pma pre ida 1 loss planned locations of the idas post ida 1 loss planned locations of the idas
