was a promotions officer for the charity the family lived at 40 stansfield road near the border of the south london areas of brixton and stockwell bowie attended stockwell infants school until he was six years old acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single minded a defiant brawler 8 in 1953 bowie moved with his family to the suburb of bromley where two years later he started attending burnt ash junior school his voice was considered adequate by the school choir and he demonstrated above average abilities in playing the recorder 9 at the age of nine his dancing during the newly introduced music and movement classes was strikingly imaginative teachers called his interpretations vividly artistic and his poise astonishing for a child 9 the same year his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of american 45s by artists including the teenagers the platters fats domino elvis presley and little richard 10 11 upon listening to little song tutti frutti bowie would later say i had heard god 12 impact on him was likewise emphatic i saw a cousin of mine dance hound dog and i had never seen her get up and be moved so much by anything it really impressed me the power of the music i started getting records immediately after that 11 by the end of the following year he had taken up the ukulele and tea chest bass begun to participate in skiffle sessions with friends and had started to play the piano meanwhile his stage presentation of numbers by both presley and chuck berry with gyrations in tribute to the original his local wolf cub group was described as like someone from another planet 11 after taking his eleven plus exam at the conclusion of his burnt ash junior education bowie went to bromley technical high school 13 it was an unusual technical school as biographer christopher sandford wrote despite its status it was by the time david arrived in 1958 as rich in arcane ritual as any english public school there were houses named after eighteenth century statesmen like pitt and wilberforce there was a uniform and an elaborate system of rewards and punishments there was also an accent on languages science and particularly design where a collegiate atmosphere flourished under the tutorship of owen frampton in account frampton led through force of personality not intellect his colleagues at bromley tech were famous for neither and yielded the most gifted pupils to the arts a regime so liberal that frampton actively encouraged his own son peter to pursue a musical career with david a partnership briefly intact thirty years later 13 bowie studied art music and design including layout and typesetting after terry burns his half brother introduced him to modern jazz his enthusiasm for players like charles mingus and john coltrane led his mother to give him a grafton saxophone in 1961 he was soon receiving lessons from a local musician 14 bowie received a serious injury at school in 1962 when his friend george underwood punched him in the left eye during a fight over a girl after a series of operations during a four month hospitalisation 15 his doctors determined that the damage could not be fully repaired and bowie was left with faulty depth perception and a permanently dilated pupil which gave a false impression of a change in the iris colour 16 despite their altercation underwood and bowie remained good friends and underwood went on to create the artwork for early albums 17 career edit early career to debut album edit a trade ad of bowie in 1967 in 1962 bowie formed his first band at the age of 15 playing guitar based rock and roll at local youth gatherings and weddings the konrads had a varying line up of between four and eight members underwood among them 18 when bowie left the technical school the following year he informed his parents of his intention to become a pop star his mother promptly arranged his employment as an mate frustrated by his bandmates limited aspirations bowie left the konrads and joined another band the king bees he wrote to the newly successful washing machine entrepreneur john bloom inviting him to do for us what brian epstein has done for the make another million bloom did not respond to the offer but his referral to dick james s partner leslie conn led to first personal management contract 19 conn quickly began to promote bowie the debut single liza jane credited to davie jones and the king bees had no commercial success dissatisfied with the king bees and their repertoire of howlin wolf and willie dixon blues numbers bowie quit the band less than a month later to join the manish boys another blues outfit who incorporated folk and used to dream of being their mick jagger bowie was to recall 19 their cover of bobby bland s i pity the fool was no more successful than liza jane and bowie soon moved on again to join the lower third a blues trio strongly influenced by the who got a habit of leaving fared no better signalling the end of contract declaring that he would exit the pop world to study mime at wells bowie nevertheless remained with the lower third his new manager ralph horton later instrumental in his transition to solo artist soon witnessed move to yet another group the buzz yielding the fifth unsuccessful single release do anything you say while with the buzz bowie also joined the riot squad their recordings which included a bowie number and the velvet underground material went unreleased ken pitt introduced by horton took over as manager 20 dissatisfied with his stage name as davy and davie jones which in the mid 1960s invited confusion with davy jones of the monkees bowie renamed himself after the 19th century american pioneer james bowie and the knife he had popularised 21 his april 1967 solo single the laughing gnome using speeded up thus high pitched vocals failed to chart released six weeks later his album debut david bowie an amalgam of pop psychedelia and music hall met the same fate it was his last release for two years 22 space oddity to hunky dory edit bowie met dancer lindsay kemp in 1967 and enrolled in his dance class at the london dance centre 23 he commented in 1972 that meeting kemp was when his interest in image really blossomed 23 he lived on his emotions he was a wonderful influence his day to day life was the most theatrical thing i had ever seen ever it was everything i thought bohemia probably was i joined the circus 24 studying the dramatic arts under kemp from avant garde theatre and mime to commedia bowie became immersed in the creation of personae to present to the world satirising life in a british prison meanwhile the bowie penned over the wall we go became a 1967 single for oscar another bowie composition silly boy blue was released by billy fury the following year 25 in january 1968 kemp choreographed a dance scene for a bbc play the pistol shot in the theatre 625 series and used bowie with a dancer hermione farthingale 26 27 the pair began dating and moved into a london flat together playing acoustic guitar farthingale formed a group with bowie and guitarist john hutchinson between september 1968 and early 1969 the trio gave a small number of concerts combining folk merseybeat poetry and mime 28 bowie and farthingale broke up in early 1969 when she went to norway to take part in a film song of norway 29 this affected him and several songs such as letter to hermione and life on mars reference her 30 31 and for the video accompanying where are we now he wore a t shirt with the words m s song of norway 32 they were last together in january 1969 for the filming of love you till tuesday a 30 minute film that was not released until 1984 intended as a promotional vehicle it featured performances from repertoire including space oddity which had not been released when the film was made 33 after the break up with farthingale bowie moved in with mary finnigan as her lodger 34 during this period he appeared in a lyons maid ice cream commercial and was rejected for another by kit kat 33 in february and march 1969 he undertook a short tour with marc bolan s duo tyrannosaurus rex as third on the bill performing a mime act 35 on 11 july 1969 space oddity was released five days ahead of the apollo 11 launch and reached the top five in the uk 33 continuing the divergence from rock and roll and blues begun by his work with farthingale bowie joined forces with finnigan christina ostrom and barrie jackson to run a folk club on sunday nights at the three tuns pub in beckenham high street 34 influenced by the arts lab movement this developed into the beckenham arts lab and became extremely popular the arts lab hosted a free festival in a local park the subject of his song memory of a free festival 36 second album followed in november originally issued in the uk as david bowie it caused some confusion with its predecessor of the same name and the early us release was instead titled man of words man of music it was reissued internationally in 1972 by rca records as space oddity featuring philosophical post hippie lyrics on peace love and morality its acoustic folk rock occasionally fortified by harder rock the album was not a commercial success at the time of its release 37 bowie met angela barnett in april 1969 they married within a year her impact on him was immediate and her involvement in his career far reaching leaving manager ken pitt with limited influence which he found frustrating 38 having established himself as a solo artist with space oddity bowie began to sense a lacking a full time band for gigs and he could relate to personally 39 the shortcoming was underlined by his artistic rivalry with marc bolan who was at the time acting as his session guitarist 39 a band was duly assembled john cambridge a drummer bowie met at the arts lab was joined by tony visconti on bass and mick ronson on electric guitar known as the hype the bandmates created characters for themselves and wore elaborate costumes that prefigured the glam style of the spiders from mars after a disastrous opening gig at the london roundhouse they reverted to a configuration presenting bowie as a solo artist 39 40 their initial studio work was marred by a heated disagreement between bowie and cambridge over the drumming style matters came to a head when an enraged bowie accused the drummer of the disturbance exclaiming fucking up my album cambridge summarily quit and was replaced by mick woodmansey 41 not long after the singer fired his manager and replaced him with tony defries this resulted in years of litigation that concluded with bowie having to pay pitt compensation 41 the studio sessions continued and resulted in third album the man who sold the world 1970 which contained references to schizophrenia paranoia and delusion 42 characterised by the heavy rock sound of his new backing band it was a marked departure from the acoustic guitar and folk rock style established by space oddity to promote it in the us mercury records financed a coast to coast publicity tour across america in which bowie between january and february 1971 was interviewed by radio stations and the media exploiting his androgynous appearance the original cover of the uk version unveiled two months later depicted the singer wearing a dress taking the garment with him he wore it during the approval of critics including rolling stone s john mendelsohn who described him as ravishing almost disconcertingly reminiscent of lauren bacall and in the street to mixed reaction including laughter and in the case of one male pedestrian producing a gun and telling bowie to kiss my ass 43 44 during the tour observation of two seminal american proto punk artists led him to develop a concept that eventually found form in the ziggy stardust character a melding of the persona of iggy pop with the music of lou reed producing the ultimate pop idol 43 a girlfriend recalled his scrawling notes on a cocktail napkin about a crazy rock star named iggy or ziggy and on his return to england he declared his intention to create a character who looks like landed from mars 43 the stardust surname was a tribute to the legendary stardust cowboy whose record he was given during the tour bowie would later cover i took a trip on a gemini space ship on heathen 45 hunky dory 1971 found visconti producer and bassist supplanted in both roles by ken scott and trevor bolder respectively the album saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of space oddity with light fare such as kooks a song written for his son duncan zowie haywood jones born on 30 may 46 his parents chose his kooky was known as zowie for the next 12 the greek word zoe life 47 elsewhere the album explored more serious subjects and found bowie paying unusually direct homage to his influences with song for bob dylan andy warhol and queen bitch a velvet underground pastiche it was not a significant commercial success at the time 48 ziggy stardust edit bowie during the ziggy stardust tour from dressed in a striking costume his hair dyed reddish brown bowie launched his ziggy stardust stage show with the spiders from mars bolder and the toby jug pub in tolworth on 10 february 1972 49 the show was hugely popular catapulting him to stardom as he toured the uk over the next six months and creating as described by buckley a cult of bowie that was influence lasted longer and has been more creative than perhaps almost any other force within pop fandom 49 the rise and fall of ziggy stardust and the spiders from mars 1972 combining the hard rock elements of the man who sold the world with the lighter experimental rock and pop of hunky dory was released in june starman issued as an april single ahead of the album was to

tour continued to the united states 50 bowie contributed backing vocals to lou reed s 1972 solo breakthrough transformer co producing the album with mick ronson 51 his own aladdin sane 1973 topped the uk chart his first number one album described by bowie as ziggy goes to america it contained songs he wrote while travelling to and across the us during the earlier part of the ziggy tour which now continued to japan to promote the new album aladdin sane spawned the uk top five singles the jean genie and drive in saturday 52 53 love of acting led his total immersion in the characters he created for his music offstage a robot onstage i achieve emotion probably why i prefer dressing up as ziggy to being david with satisfaction came severe personal difficulties acting the same role over an extended period it became impossible for him to separate ziggy later the thin white his own character offstage ziggy bowie said leave me alone for years that was when it all started to go my whole personality was affected it became very dangerous i really did have doubts about my sanity 54 his later ziggy shows which included songs from both ziggy stardust and aladdin sane were ultra theatrical affairs filled with shocking stage moments such as bowie stripping down to a sumo wrestling loincloth or simulating oral sex with guitar 55 bowie toured and gave press conferences as ziggy before a dramatic and abrupt on stage retirement at hammersmith odeon on 3 july 1973 footage from the final show was released the same year for the film ziggy stardust and the spiders from mars 56 ziggy

bowie moved to the us in 1974 initially staying in new york city before settling in los angeles 59 diamond dogs 1974 parts of which found him heading towards soul and funk was the product of two distinct ideas a musical based on a wild future in a post apocalyptic city and setting george orwell s 1984 to music 60 the album went to number one in the uk spawning the hits rebel rebel and diamond dogs and no 5 in the us to promote it bowie launched the diamond dogs tour visiting cities in north america between june and december 1974 choreographed by toni basil and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects the high budget stage production was filmed by alan yentob the resulting documentary cracked actor featured a pasty and emaciated bowie the tour coincided with the slide from heavy cocaine use into addiction producing severe physical debilitation paranoia and emotional problems 61 he later commented that the accompanying live album david live ought to have been titled david bowie is alive and well and living only in theory david live nevertheless solidified status as a superstar charting at no 2 in the uk and no 8 in the us it also spawned a uk no 10 hit in cover of eddie floyd s knock on wood after a break in philadelphia where bowie recorded new material the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul 62 bowie performing during diamond dogs tour 1974 the fruit of the philadelphia recording sessions was young americans 1975 biographer christopher sandford writes over the years most british rockers had tried one way or another to become black by extension few had succeeded as bowie did now 63 the sound which the singer identified as plastic soul constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his uk devotees 64 young americans yielded first us number one fame co written with john lennon who contributed backing vocals and carlos alomar lennon called work great but just with lipstick on 65 earning the distinction of being one of the first white artists to appear on the us variety show soul train bowie mimed fame as well as golden years his november single 66 which was originally offered to elvis presley who declined it 66 young americans was a commercial success in both the us and the uk and a re issue of the 1969 single space oddity became first number one hit in the uk a few months after fame achieved the same in the us 67 despite his by now well established superstardom bowie in the words of sandford for all his record sales over a million copies of ziggy stardust alone existed essentially on loose change 68 in 1975 in a move echoing ken acrimonious dismissal five years earlier bowie fired his manager at the culmination of the ensuing months long legal dispute he watched as described by sandford millions of dollars of his future earnings being surrendered in what were uniquely generous terms for defries then shut himself up in west 20th street where for a week his howls could be heard through the locked attic door 68 michael lippman lawyer during the negotiations became his new manager lippman in turn was awarded substantial compensation when bowie fired him the following year 69 bowie performing with cher on the variety show cher 1975 station to station 1976 produced by bowie and harry maslin 70 introduced a new bowie persona the thin white duke of its title track visually the character was an extension of thomas jerome newton the extraterrestrial being he portrayed in the film the man who fell to earth the same year 71 developing the funk and soul of young americans station to station s synthesizer heavy arrangements prefigured the krautrock influenced music of his next releases the extent to which drug addiction was now affecting bowie was made public when russell harty interviewed the singer for his london weekend television talk show in anticipation of the supporting tour shortly before the satellite linked interview was scheduled to commence the death of the spanish dictator francisco franco was announced bowie was asked to relinquish the satellite booking to allow the spanish government to put out a live newsfeed this he refused to do and his interview went ahead in the ensuing lengthy conversation with harty bowie was incoherent and looked disconnected 72 his his own later become twisted from cocaine he overdosed several times during the year and was withering physically to an alarming degree 61 73 positive comments about adolf hitler and eric clapton s about immigration restrictions in 1976 led to the establishment of rock against racism 74 station to station s january 1976 release was followed in february by a concert tour of europe and north america featuring a starkly lit set the isolar 1976 tour highlighted songs from the album including the dramatic and lengthy title track the ballads wild is the wind and word on a wing and the funkier tvc 15 and stay the core band that coalesced to record this album and guitarist carlos alomar bassist george murray and drummer dennis davis as a stable unit for the remainder of the 1970s the tour was highly successful but mired in political controversy bowie was quoted in stockholm as saying that britain could benefit from a fascist leader and was detained by customs on the russian polish border for possessing nazi paraphernalia 75 bowie as the thin white duke at maple leaf gardens toronto 1976 matters came to a head in london in may in what became known as the victoria station incident arriving in an open top mercedes convertible bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a nazi salute which was captured on camera and published in nme bowie said the photographer simply caught him in mid wave 76 he later blamed his pro fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the thin white duke 77 i was out of my mind totally crazed the main thing i was functioning on was that whole thing about hitler and discovered king arthur 73 according to playwright alan franks writing later in the times he was indeed deranged he had some very bad experiences with hard drugs 78 cocaine addiction which had caused these controversies had much to do with his time living in los angeles a city which alienated him hugely discussing his flirtations with fascism in a 1980 interview with nme bowie explained that los angeles was where it had all happened the fucking place should be wiped off the face of the earth to be anything to do with rock and roll and go and live in los angeles is i think just heading for disaster it really is 79 berlin era edit main article berlin trilogy bowie moved to switzerland in 1976 purchasing a chalet in the hills to the north of lake geneva in the new environment his cocaine use decreased and he found time for other pursuits outside his musical career 80 he devoted more time to his painting and produced a number of post modernist pieces when on tour he took to sketching in a notebook and photographing scenes for later reference visiting galleries in geneva and the museum in berlin bowie became in the words of biographer christopher sandford a prolific producer and collector of contemporary not only did he become a well known patron of expressionist art locked in clos des he began an intensive self improvement course in classical music and literature and started work on an autobiography 81 apartment building on 155 in berlin where bowie lived from 1976 to 1978 before the end of 1976 interest in the burgeoning german music scene as well as his drug addiction prompted him to move to west berlin to clean up and revitalise his career there he was often seen riding a bicycle between his apartment on in and hansa tonstudio the recording studio he used located on in kreuzberg near the berlin wall 82 while working with brian eno and sharing an apartment with iggy pop he began to focus on minimalist ambient music for the first of three albums co produced with tony visconti that became known as his berlin trilogy 83 during the same period iggy pop with bowie as a co writer and musician completed his solo album debut the idiot and its follow up lust for life touring the uk europe and the us in march and april 1977 84 bowie performing in oslo norway 1978 the album low 1977 partly influenced by the krautrock sound of kraftwerk and neu evinced a move away from narration in songwriting to a more abstract musical form in which lyrics were sporadic and optional although he completed the album in november 1976 it took his unsettled record company another three months to release it 82 it received considerable negative criticism upon its release which rca anxious to maintain the established commercial momentum did not welcome and which former manager tony defries who still maintained a significant financial interest in the affairs tried to prevent despite these forebodings low yielded the uk no 3 single sound and vision and its own performance surpassed that of station to station in the uk chart where it reached no 2 leading contemporary composer philip glass described low as a work of genius in 1992 when he used it as the basis for his symphony no 1 low subsequently glass used next album as the basis for his 1996 symphony no 4 heroes 85 86 glass has praised gift for creating fairly complex pieces of music masquerading as simple

and heroes bowie spent much of 1978 on the isolar ii world tour bringing the music of the first two berlin trilogy albums to almost a million people during 70 concerts in 12 countries by now he had broken his drug addiction biographer david buckley writes that isolar ii was first tour for five years in which he had probably not anaesthetised himself with copious quantities of cocaine before taking the without the oblivion that drugs had brought he was now in a healthy enough mental condition to want to make friends 91 recordings from the tour made up the live album stage released the same year 92 the final piece in what bowie called his triptych lodger 1979 eschewed the minimalist ambient nature of the other two making a partial return to the drum and guitar based rock and pop of his pre berlin era the result was a complex mixture of new wave and world music in places incorporating hijaz non western scales some tracks were composed using eno and peter schmidt s oblique strategies cards boys keep swinging entailed band members swapping instruments move on used the chords from early composition all the young dudes played backwards and red money took backing tracks from sister midnight a piece previously composed with iggy pop 93 the album was recorded in switzerland ahead of its release mel ilberman stated it would be fair to call it sergeant pepper a concept

visage to act in the accompanying video renowned as one of the most innovative of all time 97 while scary monsters used principles established by the berlin albums it was considered by critics to be

america i think it stood in the way of so much i wanted to do 268 buckley wrote that bowie mined sexual intrigue for its ability to shock 269 and was probably never gay nor even consistently actively

notes edit in 1993 bowie recalled having read city of night in the 1960s and it connected with his loneliness and that led me a merry dance in the early seventies when gay clubs really became my lifestyle and all my friends were gay 267 asked why he knelt and prayed bowie said he had a friend who was dying of aids he was just dropping into a coma that day and just before i went on stage something just told me to say the prayer the great irony is that he died two days after the show 267 he later said he was influenced by his cocaine addiction and the psychological terror from making the man who fell to earth marking the first time really seriously thought about christ and i very nearly got suckered into that narrow view of finding the cross as the salvation of mankind 278
