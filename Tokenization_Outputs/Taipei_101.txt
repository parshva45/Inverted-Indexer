metres per second or as well as the strongest earthquakes in a 2 500 year cycle 25 taipei 101 was designed to be flexible as well as structurally resistant because while flexibility prevents structural damage resistance ensures comfort for the occupants and for the protection of glass curtain walls and other features 26 most designs achieve the necessary strength by enlarging critical structural elements such as bracing because of the height of taipei 101 combined with the surrounding building is located just away from a major fault line 27 101 used high performance steel construction and 36 columns including eight mega columns packed with concrete 28 outrigger trusses located at eight floor intervals connect the columns in the core to those on the exterior 29 these features combined with the solidity of its foundation made taipei 101 one of the most stable buildings ever constructed 30 the foundation is reinforced by 380 piles driven into the ground extending as far as into the bedrock each pile is in diameter and can bear a load of tonnes short tons 28 during construction on 31 march 2002 a 6 8 magnitude earthquake rocked taipei two construction cranes from

101 taipei characteristic blue green glass curtain walls are double paned and glazed offer heat and uv protection sufficient to block external heat by 50 percent and can sustain impacts of 7 tonnes 8 short tons 25 the system of glass and aluminum panels installed into an inclined moment resisting lattices contributes to overall lateral rigidity by tying back to the mega columns with one story high trusses at every eighth floor this system is therefore able to withstand up to of seismic lateral displacements without damage 40 the original corners of the were tested at rwdi in ontario a simulation of a 100 year storm at rwdi revealed a vortex that formed during a 3 second 105 miles per hour wind at a height of 10 meters or equivalent to the lateral tower sway rate causing large crosswind oscillations a double chamfered step design was found to dramatically reduce this crosswind oscillation resulting in the final double stairstep corner 41 architect c y lee also used extensive elements to represent the symbolic identity he pursued these elements included the green tinted glass for the indigenous slender bamboo look eight upper outwards inclined tiers of pagoda each with eight floors a ruyi and a money box symbol between the two sections among others 42 taipei own roof and recycled water system meets 20 to 30 percent of the water needs in july 2011 taipei

numeral system used in digital technology 28 the main tower features a series of eight segments of eight floors each in chinese speaking cultures the number eight is associated with abundance prosperity and good fortune 44 45 the repeated segments simultaneously recall the rhythms of an asian pagoda a tower linking earth and sky also evoked in the petronas towers a stalk of bamboo an icon of learning and growth and a stack of ancient chinese ingots or money boxes a symbol of abundance popular humor sometimes likens the shape to a stack of take out boxes as used in western style chinese food of course the stackable shape of such boxes is likewise derived from that of ancient money boxes 46 the four discs mounted on each face of the building where the pedestal meets the tower represent coins the emblem placed over entrances shows three gold coins of ancient design with central holes shaped to imply the arabic numerals 1-0-1 28 the structure incorporates many shapes of squares and circles to reach a balance between yin and yang curled ruyi figures appear throughout the structure as a design motif though the shape of each ruyi at taipei 101 is traditional its rendering in industrial metal is plainly modern the ruyi is a talisman of ancient origin associated in art with heavenly clouds it connotes healing protection and fulfillment it appears in

orange yellow green blue violet purple the adjoining taipei 101 on the east side connects the landmark further with the symbolism of time the design of the circular park doubles as the face of a giant sundial the tower itself casts the shadow to mark afternoon hours for the occupants the design is echoed in a clock that stands at its entrance the clock runs on energy drawn from the wind shear 52 taipei 101 like many of its neighbours shows the influence of feng shui philosophy an example appears in the form of a large granite fountain at the intersection of songlian road and xinyi road near the east entrance 53 a ball at the top spins toward the tower as a work of public art the fountain offers a contrast to the tower in texture even as its design echoes the rhythms the fountain also serves a practical function in feng shui philosophy a t intersection near the entrance of a building represents a potential drain of positive energy or from a structure and its occupants 54 55 placing flowing water at such spots is thought to help redirect the flow of 56 57 interior edit taipei 101 is the first record setting skyscraper to be constructed in the 21st century it exhibits a number of
