which can often result in a cyclone having two names the japan meteorological agency jma will name a tropical cyclone should it be judged to have 10 minute sustained wind speeds of at least anywhere in the basin pagasa assigns unofficial names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between and between regardless of whether or not a tropical cyclone has already been given a name by the jma tropical depressions that are monitored by the united states joint typhoon warning center jtwc are given a numerical designation with a
