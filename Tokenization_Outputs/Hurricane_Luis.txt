westward until it developed a weak surface low on august 27 consequently a tropical depression was designated at 1200 utc that day the depression attained 36 hours later into a tropical storm named luis on august 29 though convective activity fluctuated for the next two days as a result of nearby wind shear the storm slowly intensified while pressure rose the shear relented the next day allowing an eye to gradually form and the system attained hurricane status thereafter on early august 31 then a category 3 major hurricane 18 hours later 1 tropical storms karen left and luis right on
