configuration as of may 2011 the us orbital segment consists of 11 pressurized modules of these eight are habitable and three are connecting nodes with large ports the ports are used to connect the modules together or provide berths and docks for spacecraft nodes edit each of the nodes has ports called common berthing mechanisms cbm all three nodes have 4 ports around their exterior and 1 port on each end 6 ports in total in addition to the 18 ports on the nodes there are additional ports on the modules most of these are used for mating modules together while unused cbm ports can berth one of the re supply spacecraft mplm htv dragon cargo or cygnus there are two pma adapters that change cbm ports to docking ports the type used by soyuz progress and automated transfer vehicle spacecraft this is the same port the former space shuttle used a flexible system where the layout is changed as needed unity edit the first component of the usos pressurized segment is the unity node on the aft end of unity is the pressurized mating adapter pma 1 the pma 1 connects unity with the russian segment unity is also connected to the quest airlock on the starboard side tranquility on the port side and the z1 truss on the zenith the destiny lab connects to the forward end leading to the rest of the usos unity is also used by the crews on board the iss to eat meals and share some downtime together the unity node was delivered to the station by sts 88 on december 6 1998 1 harmony edit the harmony node is the central connecting node of the usos harmony connects to the destiny lab aft end kibo lab to the port side and columbus lab to the starboard side the harmony nadir and zenith ports also serves as the berthing port for h ii transfer vehicle htv dragon and cygnus resupply vehicles on the forward end of harmony is pma 2 which was used by visiting space shuttles as a mating adapter and by future manned missions to the iss harmony was delivered by the sts 120 mission on october 23 2007 2 tranquility and cupola edit the tranquility node houses the usos life support systems 3 tranquility also hosts the seven windowed cupola module and the leonardo modile on its forward port the cupola is used for earth observation and robotic operations 4 the forward facing port of tranquility is blocked by the truss structure while the aft facing port is free for use while the nadir port is used by the cupola the zenith port is used by some exercise equipment inside the node the port side port is occupied by the pma 3 and the starboard port is connected to node 1 the cupola and tranquility modules were delivered by sts 130 in february 2010 5 laboratories edit destiny edit the destiny laboratory is the american built laboratory module it is used for medical engineering

permanent multipurpose module pmm is a module used for stowage space on the iss leonardo is attached to the forward facing side of the tranquility node the pmm was delivered to the iss by the sts 133 mission in early 2011 originally the multi purpose logistics module mplm leonardo it was converted to stay on orbit for an extended period of time prior to being installed on the iss pressurized mating adapter edit the pressurized mating adapters pma serve as docking ports on the usos portion of the iss currently pma 1 is used to connect the unity node with the zarya module on the iss pressurized mating adapter 2 is located on the forward end of harmony and was used by the space shuttle to dock with the iss any future manned american spaceflights to the iss will use pma 2 the third pressurized mating adapter is located on the aft end of the tranquility node currently pma 3 serves only as a storage location and serves as a back up to pma 2 pma 1 and pma 2 were delivered with the unity node on sts 88 in december 1998 1 the third pma was delivered by sts 92 on october 11 2000 14 external elements edit integrated truss structure edit image taken during sts 113 in 2002 showing a portion of the its image taken during sts 122 in 2008 showing an its segment with solar array attached at one end the integrated truss structure its houses vital equipment on the exterior of the iss 15 each segment of truss is given a designation of p or s indicating whether the segment is on the port or starboard side and a number which indicates its position on its respective side the truss system itself consists of 12 total on each side and one central are connected to the iss by attachment points on the destiny module 16 the thirteenth piece known as the zenith 1 z1 truss segment is attached to the unity module and was originally used to hold the p6 solar arrays to provide power to the usos the z1 segment now houses the k u band antennas and serves as a routing point for power and data cables on the exterior of the iss the integrated truss structure houses four sets of solar arrays each set of solar arrays contains four arrays for a total of 16 solar arrays each of the four sets of arrays also has an associated cooling system and radiator for cooling the power supply equipment the integrated truss structure also houses the main cooling system for the iss which consists of two pumps two radiator arrays and two ammonia and two nitrogen tank assemblies there are also several payload attachment points located on the integrated truss structure these points host the external stowage platforms external logistics carriers alpha magnetic spectrometer and the mobile base system for the canadarm2 the z1 truss was delivered by the sts 92 mission in october 2000 14 the
