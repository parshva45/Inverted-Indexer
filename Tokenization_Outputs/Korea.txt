korea emerged as a singular political entity in 676ce after centuries of conflict among the three kingdoms of korea which were unified as unified silla to the south and balhae to the north unified silla divided into three separate states during the later three kingdoms period goryeo which had succeeded goguryeo defeated the two other states and united the korean peninsula around the same time balhae collapsed and its last crown prince fled south to goryeo goryeo also spelled as whose name developed into the modern exonym korea was a highly cultured state that created the first metal movable type in 1234 4 5 6 7 8 9 however multiple invasions by the mongol yuan dynasty during the 13th century greatly weakened the nation which eventually agreed to become a vassal state after decades of fighting following the yuan collapse severe political strife followed and goryeo eventually fell to a coup led by general yi seong gye who established joseon in 1392 the first 200 years of joseon were marked by relative peace during this period the korean alphabet was created by sejong the great in the 15th century and there was increasing influence of confucianism during the later part of the dynasty isolationist policy earned it the western nickname of the hermit kingdom by the late 19th century the country became the object of imperial design by the empire of japan after the first sino japanese war despite the korean empire s effort to modernize it was annexed by japan in 1910 and ruled by imperial japan until the end of world war ii in august 1945 in 1945 the soviet union and the united states agreed on the surrender of japanese forces in korea in the aftermath of world war ii leaving korea partitioned along the 38th parallel the north was under soviet occupation and the south under u s occupation these circumstances soon became the basis for the division of korea by the two superpowers exacerbated by their incapability to agree on the terms of korean independence the communist inspired government in the north received backing from the soviet union in opposition to the pro western government in the south leading to division into two political entities north korea formally the democratic republic of korea and south korea formally the republic of korea tensions between the two resulted in the outbreak of the korean war in 1950 with involvement by foreign troops the war ended in a stalemate in 1953 but without a formalized peace treaty this status contributes to the high tensions that continue to divide the peninsula to date each country contends that it is
