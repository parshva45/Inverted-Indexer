edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the scale a tropical wave developed scattered convection in the central caribbean sea on june 24 while interacting with an upper level low it moved slowly northwestward 1 and remained disorganized due to strong upper level wind shear 2 late on june 27 the convection became slightly better organized around a broad low pressure area though land interaction prevented further development as it moved towards the peninsula 3 the area of low pressure became better defined over the central peninsula and after the system turned to the northwest convection quickly organized while located over the warm waters of the gulf of mexico on june 29 following the development of a closed circulation the system organized into tropical depression three while located about 40 miles north of progreso 4 radar image of tropical storm landfall in louisiana the depression quickly strengthened to become tropical storm bill later on june 29

deep convection located far from the center though it was classified tropical due to its tropical origins 5 the storm steadily intensified as wind shear decreased 4 and early forecasts from the national hurricane center mentioned the possibility of bill intensifying to hurricane status if the low level circulation organized beneath the area of deepest convection bill turned to the north
