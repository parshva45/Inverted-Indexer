various tribes of the algonquian speaking piscataway people also known as the conoy inhabited the lands around the potomac river when europeans first visited the area in the early 17th century one group known as the nacotchtank also called the nacostines by catholic missionaries maintained settlements around the anacostia river within the present day district of columbia conflicts with european colonists and neighboring tribes forced the relocation of the piscataway people some of whom established a new settlement in 1699 near point of rocks maryland 5 in his federalist no 43 published january 23 1788 james madison argued that the new federal government would need authority over a national capital to provide for its own maintenance and safety 6 five years earlier a band of unpaid soldiers besieged congress while its members were meeting in philadelphia known as the pennsylvania mutiny of 1783 the event emphasized the need for the national government not to rely on any state for its own security 7 article one section eight of the constitution permits the establishment of a district not exceeding as may by cession of particular states and the acceptance of congress become the seat of the government of the united states 8 however the constitution does not specify a location for the capital in what is now known as the compromise of 1790 madison alexander hamilton and thomas jefferson came to an agreement that the federal government would pay each remaining revolutionary war debts in exchange for establishing the new national capital in the southern united states 9 a foundation map of the district of columbia in 1835 prior to the retrocession on july 9 1790 congress passed the residence act which approved the creation of a national capital on the potomac river the exact location was to be selected by president george washington who signed the bill into law on july 16 formed from land donated by the states of maryland and virginia the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring 10 miles on each side totaling 100 square miles 2 10 b two pre existing settlements were included in the territory the port of georgetown maryland founded in 1751 11 and the city of alexandria virginia founded in 1749 12 during andrew ellicott and several assistants including a free african american astronomer named benjamin banneker surveyed the borders of the federal district and placed boundary stones at every mile point 13 many of the stones are still standing 14 a new federal city was then constructed on the north bank of the potomac to the east of georgetown on september 9 1791 the three commissioners overseeing the construction named the city in honor of president washington the federal district was named columbia which was a poetic name for the united states commonly in use at that time 15 16 congress held its first session in washington on november 17 1800 17 congress passed the organic act of 1801 which officially organized the district and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government further the unincorporated area within the district was organized into two counties the county of washington to the east of the potomac and the county of alexandria to the west 18 after the passage of this act citizens living in the district were no longer considered residents of maryland or virginia which therefore ended their representation in congress 19 theatre in the 19th century site of the 1865 assassination of president lincoln on august 1814 in a raid known as the burning of washington british forces invaded the capital during the war of 1812 the capitol treasury and white house were burned and gutted during the attack 20 most government buildings were repaired quickly however the capitol was largely under construction at the time and was not completed in its current form until 1868 21 retrocession and the civil war see also district of columbia retrocession and washington d c in the american civil war in the 1830s the southern territory of alexandria went into economic decline partly due to neglect by congress 22 the city of alexandria was a major market in the american slave trade and pro slavery residents feared that abolitionists in congress would end slavery in the district further depressing the economy citizens petitioned virginia to take back the land it had donated to form the district through a process known as retrocession 23 the virginia general assembly voted in february 1846 to accept the return of alexandria and on july 9 1846 congress agreed to return all the territory that had been ceded by virginia therefore the current area consists only of the portion originally donated by maryland 22 confirming the fears of pro slavery alexandrians the compromise of 1850 outlawed the slave trade in the district although not slavery itself 24 the outbreak of the american civil war in 1861 led to expansion of the federal government and notable growth in the population including a large influx of freed slaves 25 president abraham lincoln signed the compensated emancipation act in 1862 which ended slavery in the district of columbia and freed about 3,100 enslaved persons nine months prior to the emancipation proclamation 26 in 1868 congress granted the african american male residents the right to vote in municipal elections 25 growth and redevelopment crowds surrounding the reflecting pool during the 1963 march on washington by 1870 the population had grown 75% from the previous census to nearly 132,000 residents 27 despite the growth washington still had dirt roads and lacked basic sanitation some members of congress suggested moving the capital further west but president ulysses s grant refused to consider such a proposal 28 congress passed the organic act of 1871 which repealed the individual charters of the cities of washington and georgetown and created a new territorial government for the whole district of columbia 29 president grant appointed alexander robey shepherd to the position of governor in 1873 shepherd authorized large scale projects that greatly modernized washington but ultimately bankrupted the district government in 1874 congress replaced the territorial government with an appointed three member board of commissioners 30 the first motorized streetcars began service in 1888 and generated growth in areas of the district beyond the city of original boundaries urban plan was expanded throughout the district in the following decades 31 georgetown was formally annexed by the city of washington in 1895 32 however the city had poor housing conditions and strained public works washington was the first city in the nation to undergo urban renewal projects as part of the city beautiful movement in the early 1900s 33 increased federal spending as a result of the new deal in the 1930s led to the construction of new government buildings memorials and museums in washington 34 world war ii further increased government activity adding to the number of federal employees in the capital 35 by 1950 the population reached its peak of 802,178 residents 27 civil rights and home rule era the twenty third amendment to the united states constitution was ratified in 1961 granting the district three votes in the electoral college for the election of president and vice president but still no voting representation in congress 36 after the assassination of civil rights leader dr martin luther king jr on april 4 1968 riots broke out in the district primarily in the and corridors centers of black residential and commercial areas the riots raged for three days until more than 13,600 federal troops stopped the violence many stores and other buildings were burned rebuilding was not completed until the late 1990s 37 in 1973 congress enacted the district of columbia home rule act providing for an elected mayor and 13 member council for the district 38 in 1975 walter washington became the first elected and first black mayor of the district 39 on september 11 2001 terrorists hijacked american airlines flight 77 and deliberately crashed the plane into

neighborhoods in washington d c and list of tallest buildings in washington d c plan for the federal capital city washington d c is a planned city in 1791 president washington commissioned pierre peter charles a french born architect and city planner to design the new capital he enlisted scottish surveyor alexander ralston helped layout the city plan 75 the plan featured broad streets and avenues radiating out from rectangles providing room for open space and landscaping 76 he based his design on plans of cities such as paris amsterdam karlsruhe and milan that thomas jefferson had sent to him 77 design also envisioned a garden lined grand avenue approximately 1 mile in length and 400 feet wide in the area that is now the national mall 78 plan for washington d c as revised by andrew ellicott in 1792 president washington dismissed in march 1792 due to conflicts with the three commissioners appointed to supervise the construction andrew ellicott who had worked with surveying the city was then tasked with completing the design though ellicott made revisions to the original plans including changes to some street patterns is still credited with the overall design of the city 79 by the early 1900s vision of a grand national capital had become marred by slums and randomly placed buildings including a railroad station on the national mall congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying ceremonial core 33 what became known as the mcmillan plan was finalized in 1901 and included re landscaping the capitol grounds and the national mall clearing slums and establishing a new citywide park system the plan is thought to have largely preserved intended design 76 the construction of the 12 story cairo apartment building in 1894 spurred the first building height restrictions by law skyline is low and sprawling the federal heights of buildings act of 1910 allows buildings that are no taller than the width of the adjacent street plus 20 feet 80 despite popular belief no law has ever limited buildings to the height of the united states capitol or the 555 foot washington monument 52 which remains the tallest structure city leaders have criticized the height restriction as a primary reason why the district has limited affordable housing and traffic problems caused by urban sprawl 80 the district is divided into four quadrants of unequal area northwest nw northeast ne southeast se and southwest sw the axes bounding the quadrants radiate from the u s capitol building 81 all road names include the quadrant abbreviation to indicate their
