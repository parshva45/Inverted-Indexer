center winds near the landfall point were unofficially estimated as high as 2 on this basis the hurricane is believed to have made landfall in puerto rico as a category 5 hurricane on the saffir

drove this 10 foot piece of 2x4 lumber through a palm tree in puerto rico while the storm was passing near dominica the san juan puerto rico weather bureau warned about the threat of the hurricane which would strike the island within a day or two the advisory was sent via telegraph to districts and was broadcast from the naval radio station every two hours 12 this was the first hurricane warning broadcast by radio 5 warnings were also posted for along the southern coast causing ships to avoid the island or remain at port effective preparation is credited for the relatively low death toll of 312 and not a single ship was lost at sea in the vicinity of puerto rico by comparison the weaker 1899 san ciriaco hurricane killed approximately 12 according to the san juan national weather service office the storm was up to this time the greatest and more sic intense and destructive hurricane of record in puerto rico 5 along the storm path the eye passed over guayama cayey and aibonito resulting in a period of calm lasting 12 the island of puerto rico received the worst of the winds when the hurricane moved directly across the island at category 5 strength 12 the hurricane was extremely large as it crossed puerto rico hurricane force winds were measured in guayama for since the storm is estimated to have been moving at the diameter of the hurricane winds was estimated very roughly to be 12 the storm was named the san felipe ii hurricane because the eye of the cyclone made landfall on the christian feast day of saint philip 13 it was named segundo spanish for the second because of another destructive san felipe hurricane which struck puerto rico on that same day in 1876 since european arrival in the americas in 1492 all storms and hurricanes were named after the name

hurricanes stopped being officially named after saints 13 the rainfall recorded on september 1928 remains the record for the maximum rainfall associated with a hurricane in puerto rico within a period of forty eight hours in those regions where precipitation is more common place as in adjuntas in the cordillera central and in the sierra de luquillo the rain was over 25 inches with 29.60 inches recorded in adjuntas the anemometer located in puerta de tierra lost one of its cups at on september 13 just when it had registered a maximum speed of 150 miles per speed that was sustained for five consecutive minutes previously the same instrument had measured 160 miles per hour for one minute because these measurements were taken 30 miles from san eye at the time it seemed possible that some estimates of 200 miles per hour near the center of the storm were not overdrawn 13 there was general destruction through the island with the towns where the eye passed being swept away 13 property damage on the island from winds and rain was catastrophic the northeast portion of the island received winds in excess of strength with hurricane force winds lasting as long as official reports stated several hundred thousand people were left homeless and property damages were estimated at 12 14 on the island there was no building that was not affected some sugar mills centrales that had cost millions of dollars to build were reduced to rubble reports say that 24,728 homes were destroyed and 192,444 were partially destroyed 13 most of the sugarcane fields were flooded ruining the crops half of the coffee plants and half of the shade trees that covered these were destroyed almost all of the coffee harvest was lost the coffee industry would take years to recover since coffee needs shade trees to grow the tobacco farms also had great losses after this hurricane puerto rico never regained its position as a major coffee exporter 15 communications were impacted by fallen trees landslides and damaged bridges of the school buildings destroyed or damaged according to some estimates of the day excluding personal losses the damages reached and over were left homeless san felipe

the hurricane was passing nearby grand turk reported winds of according to a ship report in the region the force of the could only be judged by the noise made by the storm which reminded me of the new york subway going full speed passing switches winds approached at nassau before the anemometer failed 1 in addition to the winds the storm dropped heavy rainfall in the region totaling in nassau 2 as

lighthouse the mortar was reportedly like toothpaste between the bricks during the storm swaying the tower off the base 23 the lighthouse keeper captain seabrook and his son franklin worked to keep the light on during the storm after the electricity went out after the generator failed to work they hand cranked the mantle 24 the building formerly used as a weather bureau office was destroyed nearby six people died after a house was demolished six other fatalities occurred west of jupiter after a school where people sought shelter collapsed 7 lake okeechobee and everglades edit inland the hurricane wreaked much more widespread destruction along the more heavily populated coast of lake okeechobee residents had been warned to evacuate the low ground earlier in the day but after the hurricane did not arrive on schedule many thought it had missed and returned to their homes in the weeks prior to storm heavy rainfall caused the lake to rise between and and filled nearby canals and ditches precipitation from the hurricane itself caused lake okeechobee to rise further 23 when the worst of the storm crossed the lake the south blowing wind caused a storm surge to overflow the small dike that had been built at the south end of the lake the resulting flood covered an area of hundreds of square miles with water that in some places was over deep houses were floated off of their foundations and dashed to pieces against any obstacle they encountered 25 most survivors and bodies were washed out into the everglades where many of the bodies were never found 26 agricultural losses in the area surrounding lake okeechobee were also significant with virtually all crops destroyed and over suffering damage 7 storm total precipitation for 1928 as the rear eyewall passed over the area the flood reversed itself breaking the dikes along the northern coast of the lake and causing similar but smaller flooding 26 route 98 then known as highway was closed until january when the bridge across the onosohatchee river at taylor creek was replaced after the original bridge was carried about upstream during the storm 27 in okeechobee county homes along the lake were destroyed by the storm surge while dwellings within the city of okeechobee were severely impacted or demolished by winds of at least however brick and concrete structured dwellings received little damage a number of three story business buildings collapsed during the storm 28 almost all roads were left impassable while communications were nearly wiped out 29 overall occurred in okeechobee county along the southwestern shore of lake okeechobee the towns of clewiston and moore haven were both flooded but much of the damage to houses was due to strong winds 28 on kreamer island many residents received information about the storm when it was too late to evacuate in some homes sought shelter inside and later stood on tables and chairs to remain above the water most of the homes were swept away into rows of pine trees and others more than half a mile away despite this only one person drowned on the island residents of torry island also did not have ample time to prepare for the storm they attempted to evacuate but the causeway was already inundated forcing twenty three people to seek refuge in a packinghouse floodwaters entered the building forcing the occupants into the rafters however the building was eventually pushed into a nearby canal ten people drowned but thirteen others survived by clinging to a barge or tree tops while one woman tied herself to a telegraph pole others that survived were swept far away from where the building once stood or the barge a teenage boy was carried from the packinghouse to the everglades experiment station in belle glade a distance of about 23 on ritta island a number who successfully climbed to the roof of their houses were struck by trees or received fatal bites from water moccasin 30 in south bay nearly all houses were destroyed and several buildings were unroofed at least occurred in the city 18 the future first mayor of south bay aubrey a k a orb or a o walker along with his brother haughty d walker a k a haught survived the great hurricane of 1928 by gathering family members and joining a number of other south bay citizens on a barge in the canal which allowed them to survive the flood waters that swept over south bay and ultimately engulfed okeelanta 31 throughout the 1920s okeelanta suffered several floods and muck fires finally the town was flooded severely during the storm and was subsequently abandoned 32 bean city was also destroyed during the hurricane but it was eventually rebuilt by arthur wells 33 sebring farms was reduced to piles of rubber with only four tall royal palm trees left standing 7 only the hotel at miami locks survived the storm 7 ninety nine people died in that town 7 in chosen only two people managed to escape a house that sheltered nineteen people twenty other residents took refuge in a building which lost its roof during the storm forcing the occupants to move into the restroom a house that was full of people floated about half a mile from its original location the refugees were unaware that the house was moving until it collided with a railroad embankment 23 burial of victims in west palm beach floodwaters persisted for several weeks greatly impeding attempts to clean up the devastation burial services were quickly overwhelmed and many of the bodies were placed into mass graves around 75% of the fatalities were migrant farm workers making identification of both dead and missing bodies very difficult as a result of this the count of the dead is not very accurate the red cross estimated the number of fatalities as 1,836 which was taken as the official count by the national weather service for many years and exactly equal to the official count for hurricane katrina older sources usually list 3,411 as the total count of fatalities including the caribbean however in 2003 the u s death count was revised to at least 2,500 making the okeechobee hurricane the second deadliest natural disaster in united states history behind the 1900 galveston hurricane a mass grave at the port mayaca cemetery east of port mayaca contains the bodies of 1,600 victims of the hurricane 26 central and north florida edit in fort myers property damage was slight limited mostly to scores of small boats and fishing shacks along the waterfront 34 nearly all cigar factories in tampa were closed after wind and rain drove too much moisture into the buildings 35 offshore the fishing smack wallace a mcdonnell was beached near piney point though all of the crew survived additionally the cuban schooner isabel alvado sank offshore boca grande the crew who were immigrants were rescued by the coast guard and later deported 36 in martin county a bridge connecting stuart and palm city was severely damaged and closed to traffic as a result a temporary ferry service across the st lucie river was established and operated until repairs to the bridge were complete in the summer of 1929 37 in fort pierce most of the impact was confined to the waterfront areas a warehouse fish houses docks and a bridge across the indian river were destroyed while several other buildings were unroofed damage in the city totaled about $150,000. 18 in the interior areas of central and north florida impact was mainly confined to agricultural losses particularly citrus though wind damage occurred to structures between sebring and lake wales poles were toppled in bartow business building windows were shattered and signs were knocked down while several roofs and chimneys also suffered damage winds gusting up to lashed lakeland many trees were uprooted and several buildings were impacted including the hospital and a number of businesses at florida southern college fsc the north side of the gymnasium collapsed while other buildings on campus were damaged to a lesser degree the trees in the citrus grove surrounding fsc lost much of their fruit overall lakeland suffered about $50,000 in damage 38 in orlando impact to properties was described as slight 34 winds up to impacted the jacksonville area resulting in minor damage at jacksonville beach 39 elsewhere edit outside of florida damage in the united states was minor from the hurricane 2 in georgia low lying streets were flooded or washed out in the savannah area additionally winds downed trees and power lines 1 heavy rainfall occurred from eastern florida through coastal georgia the carolinas and southeast virginia the highest rainfall total was 12.53 inches at darlington south carolina 40 the storm caused flooding in north carolina and brought near hurricane force

everything in its path the death toll was by far highest and the aftermath the worst in the economically poor areas in the low lying ground right around lake okeechobee such as belle glade chosen pahokee south bay and bean city 45 around 75% of the fatalities were among migrant farm workers most of whom were black the black workers did most of the post hurricane cleanup work and the few caskets available for burials were mostly used for the bodies of whites 46 additionally the white victims received a proper burial at woodlawn cemetery in downtown west palm beach 45 which was the only mass gravesite to receive a timely memorial 46 in contrast the bodies of black victims were burned in funeral pyres or thrown into mass burial sites such as the ones in west palm beach and port

with shutters had suffered practically no damage from winds that caused serious structural problems to lesser buildings buildings with well constructed frames and those made of steel concrete brick or stone were largely immune to winds and the use of shutters prevented damage to windows and the interior of the buildings coming on the heels of the 1926 miami hurricane where a similar pattern had been noticed one lasting result of the 1928 storm was improved building codes 49 flood control edit a sign advertising the completion of the hoover dike to prevent a recurrence of disasters like this one and the great miami hurricane of 1926 the florida state legislature created the okeechobee flood control district which was authorized to cooperate with the u s army corps of engineers in flood control undertakings 50 after a personal inspection of the area by president herbert hoover the corps drafted a new plan which provided for the construction of floodway channels control gates and major levees along lake shores a long term system was designed for the purpose of flood control water conservation prevention of saltwater intrusion and preservation of fish and wildlife populations 50 one of the solutions was the construction of the herbert hoover dike today concerns related to the stability have grown in response to studies indicating long term problems with piping and erosion leaks have been reported after several heavy rain events proposed solutions to the problems have included the construction of a seepage berm on the landward side of the dike with the first stage
