term ray is a historical accident as cosmic rays were at first and wrongly thought to be mostly electromagnetic radiation in common scientific usage 6 high energy particles with intrinsic mass are known as cosmic rays while photons which are quanta of electromagnetic radiation and so have no intrinsic mass are known by their common names such as gamma rays or x rays depending on their photon energy massive cosmic rays compared to photons edit in current usage the term cosmic ray almost exclusively refers to massive particles as opposed to photons massive particles those that have rest mass gain additional kinetic mass energy when they are moving due to relativistic effects through this process some particles acquire tremendously high mass energies these are significantly higher than the photon energy of even the highest energy photons detected to date the energy of the massless photon depends solely on frequency not speed as photons always travel at the same speed at the higher end of the energy spectrum relativistic kinetic energy is the main source of the mass energy of cosmic rays the oh my god particle the highest energy fermionic cosmic ray detected to date had an energy of about 3 10 20 ev while the highest energy gamma rays to be observed very high energy gamma rays are photons with energies of up to 10 14 ev hence the highest energy detected fermionic cosmic ray was around 3 10 6 times more energetic than the highest energy detected cosmic photons composition edit of primary cosmic rays which originate outside of atmosphere about 99% are the nuclei of well known atoms stripped of their electron shells and about 1% are solitary electrons similar to beta particles of the nuclei about 90% are simple protons i e hydrogen nuclei 9% are alpha particles identical to helium nuclei and 1% are the nuclei of heavier elements called hze ions 7 a very small fraction are stable particles of antimatter such as positrons or antiprotons the precise nature of this remaining fraction is an area of active research an active search from earth orbit for anti alpha particles has failed to detect them energy edit cosmic rays attract great interest practically due to the damage they inflict on microelectronics and life outside the protection of an atmosphere and magnetic field and scientifically because the energies of the most energetic ultra high energy cosmic rays uhecrs have been observed to approach 3 10 20 ev 8 about 40 million times the energy of particles accelerated by the large hadron collider 9 one can show that such enormous energies might be achieved by means of the centrifugal mechanism of acceleration in active galactic nuclei at 50 j 10 the highest energy ultra high energy cosmic rays have energies comparable to the kinetic energy of a 90 kilometre per hour baseball as a result of these discoveries there has been interest in investigating cosmic rays of even greater energies 11 most cosmic rays however do not have such extreme energies the energy distribution of cosmic rays peaks at 0.3 gigaelectronvolts 4.8 10 j 12 history edit after the discovery of radioactivity by henri becquerel in 1896 it was generally believed that atmospheric electricity ionization of the air was caused only by radiation from radioactive elements in the ground or the radioactive gases or isotopes of radon they produce 13 measurements of ionization rates at increasing heights above the ground during the decade from 1900 to 1910 showed a decrease that could be explained as due to absorption of the ionizing radiation by the intervening air 14 discovery edit in 1909 theodor wulf developed an electrometer a device to measure the rate of ion production inside a hermetically sealed container and used it to show higher levels of radiation at the top of the eiffel tower than at its base however his paper published in physikalische zeitschrift was not widely accepted in 1911 domenico pacini observed simultaneous variations of the rate of ionization over a lake over the sea and at a depth of 3 meters from the surface pacini concluded from the decrease of radioactivity underwater that a certain part of the ionization must be due to sources other than the radioactivity of the earth 15 pacini makes a measurement in 1910 in 1912 victor hess carried three enhanced accuracy wulf electrometers 16 to an altitude of 5300 meters in a free balloon flight he found the ionization rate increased approximately fourfold over the rate at ground level 16 hess ruled out the sun as the source by making a balloon ascent during a near total eclipse with the moon blocking much of the visible radiation hess still measured rising radiation at rising altitudes 16 he concluded the results of my observation are best explained by the assumption that a radiation of very great penetrating power enters our atmosphere from above in werner confirmed victor hess earlier results by measuring the increased ionization rate at an altitude of increase of ionization with altitude as measured by hess in 1912 left and by right hess received the nobel prize in physics in 1936 for his discovery 17 18 the hess balloon flight took place on 7 august 1912 by sheer coincidence exactly 100 years later on 7 august 2012 the mars science laboratory rover used its radiation assessment detector rad instrument to begin measuring the radiation levels on another planet for the first time on 31 may 2013 nasa scientists reported that a possible manned mission to mars may involve a greater radiation risk than previously believed based on the amount of energetic particle radiation detected by the rad on the mars science laboratory while traveling from the earth to mars in 19 20 21 hess lands after his balloon flight in 1912 identification edit bruno rossi wrote that in the late 1920s and early 1930s the technique of self recording electroscopes carried by balloons into the highest layers of the atmosphere or sunk to great depths under water was brought to an unprecedented degree of perfection by the german physicist erich regener and his group to these scientists we owe some of the most accurate measurements ever made of cosmic ray ionization as a function of altitude and depth 22 ernest rutherford stated in 1931 that thanks to the fine experiments of professor millikan and the even more far reaching experiments of professor regener we have now got for the first time a curve of absorption of these radiations in water which we may safely rely upon 23 in the 1920s the term cosmic rays was coined by robert millikan who made measurements of ionization due to cosmic rays from deep under water to high altitudes and around the globe millikan believed that his measurements proved that the primary cosmic rays were gamma rays i e energetic photons and he proposed a theory that they were produced in interstellar space as by products of the fusion of hydrogen atoms into the heavier elements and that secondary electrons were produced in the atmosphere by compton scattering of gamma rays but then sailing from java to the netherlands in 1927 jacob clay found evidence 24 later confirmed in many experiments of a variation of cosmic ray intensity with latitude which indicated that the primary cosmic rays are deflected by the geomagnetic field and must therefore be charged particles not photons in 1929 bothe and discovered charged cosmic ray particles that could penetrate of gold 25 charged particles of such high energy could not possibly be produced by photons from proposed interstellar fusion process citation needed in 1930 bruno rossi predicted a difference between the intensities of cosmic rays arriving from the east and the west that depends upon the charge of the primary particles the so called east west effect 26 three independent experiments 27 28 29 found that the intensity is in fact greater from the west proving that most primaries are positive during the years from 1930 to 1945 a wide variety of investigations confirmed that the primary cosmic rays are mostly protons and the secondary radiation produced in the atmosphere is primarily electrons photons and muons in 1948 observations with nuclear emulsions carried by balloons to near the top of the atmosphere showed that approximately 10% of the primaries are helium nuclei alpha particles and 1% are heavier nuclei of the elements such as carbon iron and lead 30 31 during a test of his equipment for measuring the east west effect rossi observed that the rate of near simultaneous discharges of two widely separated geiger counters was larger than the expected accidental rate in his report on the experiment rossi wrote seems that once in a while the recording equipment is struck by very extensive showers of particles which causes coincidences between the counters even placed at large distances from one another 32 in 1937 pierre auger unaware of earlier report detected the same phenomenon and investigated it in some detail he concluded that high energy primary cosmic ray particles interact with air nuclei high in the atmosphere initiating a cascade of secondary interactions that ultimately yield a shower of electrons and photons that reach ground level 33 soviet physicist sergey vernov was the first to use radiosondes to perform cosmic ray readings with an instrument carried to high altitude by a balloon on 1 april 1935 he took measurements at heights up to 13.6 kilometers using a pair of geiger counters in an anti coincidence circuit to avoid counting secondary ray showers 34 35 homi j bhabha derived an expression for the probability of scattering positrons by electrons a process now known as bhabha scattering his classic paper jointly with walter heitler published in 1937 described how primary cosmic rays from space interact with the upper atmosphere to produce particles observed at the ground level bhabha and heitler explained the cosmic ray shower formation by the cascade production of gamma rays and positive and negative electron pairs 36 citation needed energy distribution edit measurements of the energy and arrival directions of the ultra high energy primary cosmic rays by the techniques of density sampling and fast timing of extensive air showers were first carried out in 1954 by members of the rossi cosmic ray group at the massachusetts institute of technology 37 the experiment employed eleven scintillation detectors arranged within a circle 460 meters in diameter on the grounds of the agassiz station of the harvard college observatory from that work and from many other experiments carried out all over the world the energy spectrum of the primary cosmic rays is now known to extend beyond 10 20 ev a huge air shower experiment called the auger project is currently operated at a site on the pampas of argentina by an international consortium of physicists led by james cronin winner of the 1980 nobel prize in physics from the university of chicago and alan watson of the university of leeds their aim is to explore the properties and arrival directions of the very highest energy primary cosmic rays 38 the results are expected to have important implications for particle physics and cosmology due to a theoretical limit to the energies of cosmic rays from long distances about 160 million light years which occurs above 10 20 ev because of interactions with the remnant photons from the big bang origin of the universe high energy gamma rays 50 mev photons were finally discovered in the primary cosmic radiation by an mit experiment carried on the oso 3 satellite in 1967 39 components of both galactic and extra galactic origins were separately identified at intensities much less than 1% of the primary charged particles since then numerous satellite gamma ray observatories have mapped the gamma ray sky the most recent is the fermi observatory which has produced a map showing a narrow band of gamma ray intensity produced in discrete and diffuse sources in our galaxy and numerous point like extra galactic sources distributed over the celestial sphere sources of cosmic rays edit early speculation on the sources of cosmic rays included a 1934 proposal by baade and zwicky suggesting cosmic rays originated from supernovae 40 a 1948 proposal by horace w babcock suggested that magnetic variable stars could be a source of cosmic rays 41 subsequently in 1951 y sekido et al identified the crab nebula as a source of cosmic rays 42 since then a wide variety of potential sources for cosmic rays began to surface including supernovae active galactic nuclei quasars and gamma ray bursts 43 sources of ionizing radiation in interplanetary space later experiments have helped to identify the sources of cosmic rays with greater certainty in 2009 a paper presented at the international cosmic ray conference icrc by scientists at the pierre auger observatory showed ultra high energy cosmic rays uhecrs originating from a location in the sky very close to the radio galaxy centaurus a although the authors specifically stated that further investigation would be required to confirm cen a as a source of cosmic rays 44 however no correlation was found between the incidence of gamma ray bursts and cosmic rays causing the authors to set upper limits as low as erg on the flux of 1 gev 1 tev cosmic rays from gamma ray bursts 45 in 2009 supernovae were said to have been pinned down as a source of cosmic rays a discovery made by a group using data from the very large telescope 46 this analysis however was disputed in 2011 with data from pamela which revealed that spectral shapes of hydrogen and helium nuclei are different and cannot be described well by a single power law suggesting a more complex process of cosmic ray formation 47 in february 2013 though research analyzing data from fermi revealed through an observation of neutral pion decay that supernovae were indeed a source of cosmic rays with each explosion producing roughly 42 43 j of cosmic rays 3 4 however supernovae do not produce all cosmic rays and the proportion of cosmic rays that they do produce is a question which cannot be answered without further study 48 in 2017 a research paper used data from the international space station identified a possible source as dark matter being a self annihilating wimp 49 types edit cosmic rays can be divided into two types galactic cosmic rays gcr high energy particles originating outside the solar system and solar energetic particles high energy particles predominantly protons emitted by the sun primarily in solar particle events however the term cosmic ray is often used to refer to only the gcr flux despite the nomenclature galactic gcrs may originate within or outside the galaxy as discussed in the source section above primary cosmic particle collides with a molecule of atmosphere cosmic rays originate as primary cosmic rays which are those originally produced in various astrophysical processes primary cosmic rays are composed primarily of protons and alpha particles 99 with a small amount of heavier nuclei 1 and an extremely minute proportion of positrons and antiprotons 7 secondary cosmic rays caused by a decay of primary cosmic rays as they impact an atmosphere include neutrons pions positrons and muons of these four the latter three were first detected in cosmic rays primary cosmic rays edit primary cosmic rays primarily originate from outside the solar system and sometimes even the milky way when they interact with atmosphere they are converted to secondary particles the mass ratio of helium to hydrogen nuclei 28 is similar to the primordial elemental abundance ratio of these elements 24 50 the remaining fraction is made up of the other heavier nuclei that are typical nucleosynthesis end products primarily lithium beryllium and boron these nuclei appear in cosmic rays in much greater abundance 1 than in the solar atmosphere where they are only about 10 as abundant as helium cosmic rays made up of charged nuclei heavier than helium are called hze ions due to the high charge and heavy nature of hze ions their contribution to an radiation dose in space is significant even though they are relatively scarce this abundance difference is a result of the way secondary cosmic rays are formed carbon and oxygen nuclei collide with interstellar matter to form lithium beryllium and boron in a process termed cosmic ray spallation spallation is also responsible for the abundances of scandium titanium vanadium and manganese ions in cosmic rays produced by collisions of iron and nickel nuclei with interstellar matter 51 primary cosmic ray antimatter edit see also alpha magnetic spectrometer satellite experiments have found evidence of positrons and a few antiprotons in primary cosmic rays amounting to less than 1% of the particles in primary cosmic rays these do not appear to be the products of large amounts of antimatter from the big bang or indeed complex antimatter in the universe rather they appear to consist of only these two elementary particles newly made in energetic processes preliminary results from the presently operating alpha magnetic spectrometer ams 02 on board the international space station show that positrons in the cosmic rays arrive with no directionality and with energies that range from 10 gev to 250 gev in september 2014 new results with almost twice as much data were presented in a talk at cern and published in physical review letters 52 53 a new measurement of positron fraction up to 500 gev was reported showing that positron fraction peaks at a maximum of about 16% of total electron positron events around an energy of gev at higher energies up to 500 gev the ratio of positrons to electrons begins to fall again the absolute flux of positrons also begins to fall before 500 gev but peaks at energies far higher than electron energies which peak about 10 gev 54 these results on interpretation have been suggested to be due to positron production in annihilation events of massive dark matter particles 55 cosmic ray antiprotons also have a much higher average energy than their normal matter counterparts protons they arrive at earth with a characteristic energy maximum of indicating their production in a fundamentally different process from cosmic ray protons which on average have only one sixth of the energy 56 there is no evidence of complex antimatter atomic nuclei such as antihelium nuclei i e anti alpha particles in cosmic rays these are actively being searched for a prototype of the ams 02 designated ams 01 was flown into space aboard the space shuttle discovery on sts 91 in june 1998 by not detecting any antihelium at all the ams 01 established an upper limit of 1.1 10 for the antihelium to helium flux ratio 57 the moon in cosmic rays the moon s cosmic ray shadow as seen in secondary muons detected 700 m below ground at the detector the moon as seen by the compton gamma ray observatory in gamma rays with energies greater than these are produced by cosmic ray bombardment on its surface 58 secondary cosmic rays edit when cosmic rays enter the atmosphere they collide with atoms and molecules mainly oxygen and nitrogen the interaction produces a cascade of lighter particles a so called air shower secondary radiation that rains down including x rays muons protons alpha particles pions electrons and neutrons 59 all of the produced particles stay within about one degree of the primary path typical particles produced in such collisions are neutrons and charged mesons such as positive or negative pions and kaons some of these subsequently decay into muons which are able to reach the surface of the earth and even penetrate for some distance into shallow mines the muons can be easily detected by many types of particle detectors such as cloud chambers bubble chambers or scintillation detectors the observation of a secondary shower of particles in multiple detectors at the same time is an indication that all of the particles came from that event cosmic rays impacting other planetary bodies in the solar system are detected indirectly by observing high energy gamma ray emissions by gamma ray telescope these are distinguished from radioactive decay processes by their higher energies above cosmic ray flux edit an overview of the space environment shows the relationship between the solar activity and galactic cosmic rays 60 the flux of incoming cosmic rays at the upper atmosphere is dependent on the solar wind the magnetic field and the energy of the cosmic rays at distances of 94 au from the sun the solar wind undergoes a transition called the termination shock from supersonic to subsonic speeds the region between the termination shock and the heliopause acts as a barrier to cosmic rays decreasing the flux at lower energies by however the strength of the solar wind is not constant and hence it has been observed that cosmic ray flux is correlated with solar activity in addition the magnetic field acts to deflect cosmic rays from its surface giving rise to the observation that the flux is apparently dependent on latitude longitude and azimuth angle the combined effects of all of the factors mentioned contribute to the flux of cosmic rays at surface the following table of participial frequencies reach the planet 61 and are inferred from lower energy radiation reaching the ground 62 particle energy ev particle rate m s 1 10 9 gev 1 10 4 1 10 12 tev 1 1 10 16 10 pev 1 10 a few times a year 1 10 20 100 eev 1 10 once a century in the past it was believed that the cosmic ray flux remained fairly constant over time however recent research suggests 1.5 to 2 fold millennium timescale changes in the cosmic ray flux in the past forty thousand years 63 the magnitude of the energy of cosmic ray flux in interstellar space is very comparable to that of other deep space energies cosmic ray energy density averages about one electron volt per cubic centimeter of interstellar space or 1 ev cm 3 which is comparable to the energy density of visible starlight at 0.3 ev cm 3 the galactic magnetic field energy density assumed 3 microgauss which is 0.25 ev cm 3 or the cosmic microwave background cmb radiation energy density at 0.25 ev cm 3 64 detection methods edit the veritas array of air cherenkov telescopes there are several ground based methods of detecting cosmic rays currently in use the first detection method is called the air cherenkov telescope designed to detect low energy cosmic rays by means of analyzing their cherenkov radiation which for cosmic rays are gamma rays emitted as they travel faster than the speed of light in their medium the atmosphere 65 while these telescopes are extremely good at distinguishing between background radiation and that of cosmic ray origin they can only function well on clear nights without the moon shining and have very small fields of view and are only active for a few percent of the time another cherenkov telescope uses water as a medium through which particles pass and produce cherenkov radiation to make them detectable 66 comparison of radiation doses including the amount detected on the trip from earth to mars by the rad on the msl 2011 2013 19 20 21 extensive air shower eas arrays a second detection method measure the charged particles which pass through them eas arrays measure much higher energy cosmic rays than air cherenkov telescopes and can observe a broad area of the sky and can be active about 90% of the time however they are less able to segregate background effects from cosmic rays than can air cherenkov telescopes eas arrays employ plastic scintillators in order to detect particles another method was developed by robert fleischer price and walker for use in high altitude balloons 67 in this method sheets of clear plastic like 0.25 mm lexan polycarbonate are stacked together and exposed directly to cosmic rays in space or high altitude the nuclear charge causes chemical bond breaking or ionization in the plastic at the top of the plastic stack the ionization is less due to the high cosmic ray speed as the cosmic ray speed decreases due to deceleration in the stack the ionization increases along the path the resulting plastic sheets are etched or slowly dissolved in warm caustic sodium hydroxide solution that removes the surface material at a slow known rate the caustic sodium hydroxide dissolves the plastic at a faster rate along the path of the ionized plastic the net result is a conical etch pit in the plastic the etch pits are measured under a high power microscope typically oil immersion and the etch rate is plotted as a function of the depth in the stacked plastic this technique yields a unique curve for each atomic nucleus from 1 allowing identification of both the charge and energy of the cosmic ray that traverses the plastic stack the more extensive the ionization along the path the higher the charge in addition to its uses for cosmic ray detection the technique is also used to detect nuclei created as products of nuclear fission a fourth method involves the use of cloud chambers 68 to detect the secondary muons created when a pion decays cloud chambers in particular can be built from widely available materials and can be constructed even in a high school laboratory a fifth method involving bubble chambers can be used to detect cosmic ray particles 69 another method detects the light from nitrogen fluorescence caused by the excitation of nitrogen in the atmosphere by the shower of particles moving through the atmosphere this method allows for accurate detection of the direction from which the cosmic ray came 70 finally the cmos devices in pervasive smartphone cameras have been proposed as a practical distributed network to detect air showers from ultra high energy cosmic rays uhecrs which is at least comparable with that of conventional cosmic ray detectors 71 the app which is currently in beta and accepting applications is crayfis cosmic rays found in smartphones 72 73 effects edit changes in atmospheric chemistry edit cosmic rays ionize the nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the atmosphere which leads to a number of chemical reactions one of the reactions results in ozone depletion cosmic rays are also responsible for the continuous production of a number of unstable isotopes in the atmosphere such as carbon 14 via the reaction n 14 n p 14 c cosmic rays kept the level of carbon 14 74 in the atmosphere roughly constant 70 tons for at least the past 100,000 years citation needed until the beginning of above ground nuclear weapons testing in the early 1950s this is an important fact used in radiocarbon dating

years role in ambient radiation edit cosmic rays constitute a fraction of the annual radiation exposure of human beings on the earth averaging 0.39 msv out of a total of 3 msv per year 13 of total background for the population however the background radiation from cosmic rays increases with altitude from 0.3 msv per year for sea level areas to 1.0 msv per year for higher altitude cities raising cosmic radiation exposure to a quarter of total background radiation exposure for populations of said cities airline crews flying long distance high altitude routes can be exposed to 2.2 msv of extra

to alter the states of circuit components in electronic integrated circuits causing transient errors to occur such as corrupted data in electronic memory devices or incorrect performance of cpus often referred to as soft errors this has been a problem in electronics at extremely high altitude such as in satellites but with transistors becoming smaller and smaller this is becoming an increasing concern in ground level electronics as well 81 studies by ibm in the 1990s suggest that computers typically experience about one cosmic ray induced error per 256 megabytes of ram per month 82 to alleviate this problem the intel corporation has proposed a cosmic ray detector that could be integrated into future high density microprocessors allowing the processor to repeat the last command following a cosmic ray event 83 cosmic rays were suspected as a possible cause of an in flight incident in 2008 where an airbus a330 airliner of qantas twice plunged hundreds of feet after an unexplained malfunction in its flight control system many passengers and crew members were injured some seriously after this incident the accident investigators for nw australia gave the ruling that there was a design flaw in the air data inertial reference unit and a limitation of the computer software the serious qantas a330 upset was caused by a long dormant computer flaw triggered by chance 84 this has prompted a software upgrade to all a330 and a340 airliners worldwide so that any data spikes in this system are filtered out electronically 85 see also radiation hardening see also ecc memory significance to aerospace travel edit main article health threat from cosmic rays galactic cosmic rays are one of the most important barriers standing in the way of plans for interplanetary travel by crewed spacecraft cosmic rays also pose a threat to electronics placed aboard outgoing probes in 2010 a malfunction aboard the voyager 2 space probe was credited to a single flipped bit probably caused by a cosmic ray strategies such as physical or magnetic shielding for spacecraft have been considered in order to minimize the damage to electronics and human beings caused by cosmic rays 86 87 flying 12 kilometres high passengers and crews of jet airliners are exposed to at least 10 times the cosmic ray dose that people at sea level receive aircraft flying polar routes near the geomagnetic poles are at particular risk 88 89 90 91 role in lightning edit cosmic rays have been implicated in the triggering of electrical breakdown in lightning it has been proposed that essentially all lightning is triggered through a relativistic process runaway breakdown seeded by cosmic ray secondaries subsequent development of the lightning discharge then occurs through conventional breakdown mechanisms 92 postulated role in climate change edit a role of cosmic rays directly or via solar induced modulations in climate change was suggested by edward p ney in 1959 93 and by robert e dickinson in 1975 94 the idea has been revived in recent years most notably by henrik svensmark who has argued that because solar variation modulates the cosmic ray flux on earth they would consequently affect the rate of cloud formation and hence the climate 95 96 however other scientists have vigorously criticized svensmark for sloppy and inconsistent work one example is adjustment of cloud data that understates error in lower cloud data but not in high cloud data 97 another example is incorrect handling of the physical data resulting in graphs that do not show the correlations they claim to show 98 in any case 97% of climate scientists 99 support the conclusions in the 2007 ipcc synthesis report which strongly attributes a major role in the ongoing global warming to human produced gases such as carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide and halocarbons and has stated that models including natural forcings only including aerosol forcings which cosmic rays are considered by some to contribute to would result in far less warming than has actually been observed or predicted in models including anthropogenic forcings 100 svensmark is one of several scientists outspokenly opposed to the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming his estimates on the magnitude of the effect of gcr galactic cosmic rays on global warming continue to be refuted in the mainstream scientific press 101 for instance a november 2013 study showed that less than 14 percent of global warming since the 1950s could be attributed to cosmic ray rate and while the models showed a small correlation every 22 years the cosmic ray rate did not match the changes in temperature indicating that it was not a causal relationship 102 another 2013 study found contrary to claims no statistically significant correlations between cosmic rays and global albedo or globally averaged cloud height 103 it has also been postulated that cosmic rays may have been responsible for major climatic change and mass extinction in the past according to adrian mellott and mikhail medvedev 62 million year cycles in biological marine populations correlate with the motion of the earth relative to the galactic plane and increases in exposure to cosmic rays 104 the researchers suggest that this and gamma ray bombardments deriving from local supernovae could have affected cancer and mutation rates and might be linked to decisive alterations in the climate and to the mass extinctions of the ordovician 105 106 research and experiments edit see also cosmic ray observatory there are a number
