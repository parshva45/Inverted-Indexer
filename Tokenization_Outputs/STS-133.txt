discovery docked with the international space station it was discovery s 39th and final mission the mission launched on 24 february 2011 and landed on 9 march 2011 the crew consisted of six american astronauts all of whom had been on prior spaceflights headed by commander steven lindsey the crew joined the long duration six person crew of expedition 26 who were already aboard the space station 7 about a month before lift off one of the original crew members tim kopra was injured in a bicycle accident he was replaced by stephen bowen the mission transported several items to the space station including the permanent multipurpose module leonardo which was left permanently docked to one of the ports the shuttle also carried the third of four express logistics carriers to the iss as well as a humanoid robot called robonaut 8 the mission marked both the 133rd flight of the space shuttle program and the 39th and final flight of discovery with the orbiter completing a cumulative total of a whole year 365 days in space the mission was affected by a series of delays due to technical problems with the external tank and to a lesser extent the payload the launch initially scheduled for september 2010 was pushed back to october then to november then finally to february 2011 contents 1 mission payload 1.1 permanent multipurpose module 1.2 express logistics carrier 4 1.3 robonaut2 1.4

article permanent multipurpose module pmm leonardo at the space station processing facility sspf sts 133 left leonardo named after the famed italian renaissance inventor leonardo da vinci one of the three multi purpose logistics modules mplms on the space station as a permanent multipurpose module pmm 9 10 pmm leonardo added much needed storage space on the iss and was launched with a near full load of payloads the construction of the leonardo mplm by the italian space agency commenced in april 1996 in august 1998 after the completion of primary construction leonardo was delivered to the kennedy space center ksc in march 2001 leonardo made its first mission on discovery as part of the sts 102 flight the liftoff of leonardo inside discovery s payload bay on sts 102 marked the first of seven mplm flights prior to sts 133 with the landing of discovery after the sts 131 mission leonardo was transferred back to the space station processing facility at kennedy space center leonardo began receiving modifications and reconfigurations immediately to convert it for permanent attachment to the space station and to facilitate on orbit maintenance 11 some equipment was removed to reduce the overall weight of leonardo these removals resulted in a net weight loss of additional modifications to leonardo included the installation of upgraded multi layer insulation mli and micro meteoroid orbital debris mmod shielding to increase the ability of the pmm to handle potential impacts of micrometeoroids or orbital debris a planar reflector was installed at the request of the japanese space agency jaxa following berthing to the space station the contents of leonardo were emptied and moved to appropriate locations on the iss once kounotori 2 htv 2 arrived in february 2011 leonardo s now unnecessary launch hardware was transferred to htv2 for ultimate destruction in atmosphere activities to reconfigure leonardo following sts 133 spanned multiple station crew increments express logistics carrier 4 edit main article express logistics carrier elc 4 being lifted from its work stand in the sspf elc 4 in its launch configuration the express logistics carrier elc is a platform designed to support external payloads mounted to the space station starboard and port trusses with either deep space or earthward views on sts 133 discovery carried the elc 4 to the station to be positioned on the starboard 3 s3 truss lower inboard passive attachment system pas the total weight of the elc 4 is approximately 8,235 pounds the express logistics carrier 4 elc 4 carried several orbital replacement units orus among these were a heat rejection system radiator hrsr flight support equipment fse which takes up one whole side of the elc the other primary orus were the express pallet controller avionics 4 expca 4 the hrsr launching on elc4 was a spare if needed for one of the six radiators that are part of the external active thermal control system robonaut2 edit main article robonaut robonaut2 and sts 133 crew members pose for a picture near a destiny lab trainer photo includes original crew member tim kopra who was later replaced by stephen bowen discovery carried the humanoid robot robonaut2 also known as r2 to the international space station iss the microgravity conditions aboard the space station provide an ideal opportunity for robots like r2 to work with astronauts although the primary initial task is teaching engineers how dexterous robots behave in space it may eventually through upgrades and advancements assist spacewalking astronauts to perform scientific work once it has been verified as functional on the space station 12 it was the first humanoid robot in space and was stowed on board the leonardo pmm once robonaut2 was unpacked it began initial operation inside the destiny module for operational testing but over time both its location and its applications could expand robonaut2 was initially designed as a prototype to be used on earth for its journey to the iss r2 received a few upgrades outer skin materials were exchanged to meet the strict flammability requirements shielding was added to reduce electromagnetic interference and onboard processors were upgraded to increase radiation tolerance the original fans were replaced with quieter ones to accommodate the restrictive noise environment and the power system was rewired to run on the direct current system tests were conducted to make sure the robot could both endure the harsh conditions in space and exist in it without doing damage r2 also underwent vibration testing that simulated the conditions it would experience during its launch onboard discovery the robot weighs 300 pounds and is made out of nickel plated carbon fiber and aluminum the height of r2 from waist to head is and it has a shoulder width of r2 is equipped with 54 servo motors and has 42 degrees of freedom 13 powered by 38 powerpc processors systems run at 120 volts dc spacex dragoneye sensor edit the dragoneye sensor as seen by an expedition 26 crew member space shuttle discovery also carried the developmental test objective dto 701b payload using advanced scientific concepts dragoneye 3d flash light detection and ranging lidar sensor the addition of the pulsed laser navigation sensor was the third time a space shuttle provided assistance to the commercial space company spacex following sts 127 and sts 129 the dragoneye on sts 133 incorporated several design and software improvements from the version flown on sts 127 to provide increased performance its inclusion on sts 133 was part of a final test run ahead of being fully implemented on dragon spacecraft which had its maiden flight in december 2010 14 the navigation sensor provides a three dimensional image based on the time of flight of a single laser pulse from the sensor to the target and back it provides both range and bearing information from targets that can reflect the light back such as the pressurized mating adapter 2 pma2 and those on the japanese kibo laboratory the dragoneye dto was mounted onto discovery s existing trajectory control system carrier assembly on the docking system spacex took data in parallel with discovery s trajectory control sensor tcs system both the tcs and dragoneye looked at the retroreflectors that are on the station after the mission spacex compared the data dragoneye collected against the data collected by the tcs to evaluate performance the sensor was installed onto discovery two weeks later than planned following a laser rod failure during testing 15 other items edit sts 133 carried the signatures of more than 500,000 students who participated in the 2010 student signatures in space program which was jointly sponsored by nasa and lockheed martin the students added their signatures to posters in may 2010 as part of the annual space day celebration through their participation students also received standards based lessons that contained a space theme citation needed student signatures in space has been active since 1997 in that time nearly seven million student signatures from 6,552 schools were flown on ten space shuttle missions 16 also carried aboard discovery were hundreds of flags bookmarks and patches which were distributed when the shuttle returned to earth the mission also flew two small lego space shuttles in honor of an educational partnership between lego and nasa astronauts also carried personal mementos including medallions with connections to their schools or military careers as well

original crew consisted of commander steven lindsey pilot eric boe and mission specialists alvin drew timothy kopra michael barratt and nicole stott however on 19 january 2011 about a month before launch it was announced that stephen bowen would replace original crew member tim kopra after kopra was injured in a bicycle accident 20 all six crew members had flown at least one spaceflight before five of the crew members all but commander steven lindsey were part of astronaut group 18 all being selected in the year 2000 21 the mission commander steven lindsey handed over his position as chief of the astronaut office position to peggy whitson in order to lead the mission 22 for the first time two mission crew members were in space when a crew assignment announcement was made as nicole stott

columbia mission crew training edit terminal countdown demonstration test edit on 12 october 2010 the sts 133 crew arrived at the kennedy space center to conduct the terminal countdown demonstration test tcdt the tcdt consisted of training for both the crew and the launch team that simulated the final hours up until launch during the tcdt the crew went through a number of exercises that included rescue training and a launch day simulation that included everything that would happen on launch day except the launch commander steve lindsey and pilot eric boe also performed abort landings and other flight aspects in the shuttle training aircraft sta for the tcdt the crew also received a briefing from nasa engineers outlining the work that had been carried out on discovery during the sts 133 processing flow after successfully completing all the tcdt tasks the crew returned to the johnson space center on 15 october 2010 23 flying aboard nasa t 38 training jets the six astronauts returned to kennedy space center on 28 october 2010 for final pre launch preparations 24 the crew gathered for the terminal countdown demonstration test launch pad 39a during the terminal countdown demonstration test on 15 january 2011 timothy kopra scheduled as the lead spacewalker for the mission at the time was injured in a bicycle accident near his houston area home reportedly breaking his hip 25 he was replaced by stephen bowen on 19 january 2011 the replacement did not affect the targeted launch date 20 this is to date the closest to a scheduled launch that a space shuttle crewmember has been replaced during the apollo program jack swigert replaced ken mattingly three days prior to the launch of apollo 13 25 shuttle processing edit sts 133 was originally manifested for launch on 16 september 2010 in june 2010 the launch date was moved to the end of october 2010 and the mission was set to take place before sts 134 which in turn had been rescheduled to february 2011 sts 133 had the longest vertical flow period 170 days since sts 35 185 days 26 discovery was moved from its hangar in the orbiter processing facility opf 3 to the nearby 52 story vehicle assembly building vab on 9 september 2010 the shuttle emerged from opf 3 at 06 54 edt and the rollover was done at 10 46 edt when discovery came to a rest in the transfer aisle 27 the quarter mile trip between the opf 3 and vab was the 41st rollover for discovery the rollover was originally planned at 06 30 edt on 8 september 2010 the move did not commence due to the unavailability of fire suppression systems because of a broken water main near the vab and turn basin that runs out to the shuttle launch pads 28 29 the two srbs were designated as flight set 122 by contractor alliant techsystems and were made up from one new segment and remaining segments reused across 54 earlier shuttle missions dating back to sts 1 30 inside the vab engineers attached a large sling to discovery and the orbiter was rotated vertical the orbiter was lifted into the high bay where its external tank et 137 and boosters were waiting to be mated during the mating operations an internal nut pre positioned inside the aft compartment of the orbiter slipped out of position and fell away inside the compartment 31 engineers initially were worried that the orbiter would have to be removed from the et and placed back in a horizontal orientation to make repairs however later they successfully accessed the area inside the aft compartment and re positioned the nut to complete the repairs the bolting of the orbiter to its et hard mate was completed early in the morning of 11 september 2010 at 09 27 edt the 44th rollout to the launch pad was scheduled to begin at 20 00 edt on 20 september 2010 32 nasa sent out more than 700 invitations to shuttle workers so they could bring their families to watch journey to the pad however the shuttle began the 3.4 mile trek from the vab to the pad earlier than planned at about at 19 23 edt on 20 september 2010 33 discovery took about six hours to arrive at pad 39a the shuttle was secured on the launch pad by 01 49 edt the next day discovery being lowered onto its external fuel tank and solid rocket boosters in high bay 3 of the vehicle assembly building space shuttle discovery attached to launch pad 39a on 21 september 2010 discovery at launch pad 39a on 1 february 2011 discovery is seen shortly after the rotating service structure was rolled back on 23 february 2011 orbital maneuvering system vapor leak edit on 14 october 2010 engineers at the launch pad first discovered a small leak in a propellant line for discovery s orbital maneuvering system oms engines the leak was detected after they noticed a fishy smell coming from the aft of the shuttle thought of as a sign of fuel vapor in the air 23 upon inspection the leak was found at a flange located at the interface where two propellant lines met in discovery s aft compartment the line carried monomethyl hydrazine mmh propellant one of two chemicals the other is an oxidizer nitrogen tetroxide used to ignite the oms engines engineers replaced an air half coupling ahc flight cap however the new cap failed to solve the problem since vapor checks still showed signs of a leak an aspirator was activated to collect the vapor at the leak site allowing work to continue in other locations around the aft segment of discovery it was believed that the leak was in the crossfeed flange area a problem with associated seals on 18 october 2010 after an afternoon review engineers were asked to double check the torque on six bolts around the suspected leaky flange fitting and tighten if necessary 34 subsequent leak tests showed again signs of seepage and the task of solving the issue required the draining of both the left and right oms tanks of the shuttle and a unique in situ repair at the pad to avoid a rollback 35 on 23 october 2010 engineers completed the removal and replacement of the two seals on the right oms crossfeed flange after the education a vacuum related procedure used to completely clear the plumbing of the toxic mmh of the plumbing was completed ahead of the schedule by over a day 36 later testing indicated that the new seals were properly seated and holding pressure with no signs of additional seepage 37 normal pad operations commenced soon after allowing managers to press forward with the confirmation of a 1 november 2010 target launch date with fuel reloading into the oms tanks beginning on the morning of 24 october 2010 main engine controller problem edit on 2 november while readying discovery for launch engineers reported an electrical issue on the backup main engine controller mec mounted on engine no 3 ssme 3 earlier in the morning engineers said that the problem had been solved however another glitch in the system raised concerns and additional troubleshooting was ordered troubleshooting followed and indicated the problem was related to transient contamination in a circuit breaker nasa test director steve payne addressing reporters told that after troubleshooting and power cycles the controller powered up normally however at the same time the problem was thought to be a non issue an unexpected voltage drop was observed 38 in a mission management team mmt meeting held later that day managers decided to scrub the launch for at least 24 hours to work towards flight rationale 39 ground umbilical carrier plate leak edit a technician begins to remove the leaky quick disconnect on 5 november 2010 discovery s launch attempt a hydrogen leak was detected at the ground umbilical carrier plate gucp during the fueling process the plate was an attachment point between the external tank and a 17 inch pipe that carried gaseous hydrogen safely away from the tank to the flare stack where it was burned off all had been proceeding to plan with the tank fast filled during tanking until the first leak indication was revealed firstly a 33,000 ppm leak then reduced to a level below 20,000 ppm was recorded the launch commit criteria limit was ppm the leak was only being observed during the cycling of the vent valve to open to release the gaseous hydrogen from the tank to the flare stack controllers decided to stop valve cycling in order to increase the pressure and attempt to force a seal before attempting to complete the fast fill process at this stage the leak spiked and remained at the highest 60,000 ppm level likely even at a higher value indicating a serious problem with the seal shuttle launch director mike leinbach characterized the leak as significant similar to what was seen on sts 119 and sts 127 although the rate was higher in magnitude and occurred earlier in the fueling process technicians begin to install a new gucp on the external tank after the day required to make the tank safe by purging remaining hydrogen gas with helium gas nasa engineers prepared for disconnection of the vent arm and the significant number of lines prior to taking their first look at the gucp on the night of 9 november technicians began disconnecting the gucp by unhooking and lowering the hydrogen vent line teams performed an initial inspection of the flight seal and quick disconnect prior to sending them to labs for a thorough engineering analysis engineers reported an unevenly asymmetrically compressed internal seal and the quick disconnect hardware also seemed have a less concentric fit than pre fueling measurements indicated 40 inspections also confirmed the condition of the hardware did not match the observations documented when it was installed on the external tank inside the vab 41 on the morning of 12 november teams began installing a new gucp and completed the gucp work over the next two days the new plate was previously fit checked on the external tank at the michoud assembly facility and yielded substantially better concentricity values than was obtained with the old and removed gucp technicians took extra measurements to ensure the best possible alignment of the newly installed gucp teams began installing the flight seal and quick disconnect on 15 november cracks in the external tank edit structural cracks in external fuel tank intertank section foam crack technicians spray foam insulation on a section of repaired stringers additional inspection of the tank revealed cracks in foam insulation in the flange between the intertank and liquid oxygen tank the cracks are believed to have occurred about an hour after super cold propellants began flowing into the external tank for the 5 november launch attempt the cracks in the tank were the first to be found at the launch pad the insulation was cut away for additional inspection revealing two additional 9 inch metal cracks on either side of an underlying structural rib called stringer s 7 2 nasa managers then decided to cut away additional foam and observed two more cracks on a stringer known as s 6 2 adjacent to the two original cracks they were found on the far left of removed foam on the flange area between the intertank and the liquid oxygen tank however these cracks appeared to have suffered less stress than the others found 42 43 no cracks were found in stringers on the right side nasa suspected the use of a lightweight aluminum lithium alloy in the tanks contributed to the crack problem repairs commenced while the shuttle remained on the pad 44 an environmental enclosure was erected around the known damage site to facilitate the ongoing repairs and eventually to apply fresh foam insulation on 18 november as part of the repairs technicians installed new sections of metal called doublers because they are twice as thick as the original stringer metal providing additional strength to replace the two cracked stringers on discovery s external tank scanning of the stringers on the liquid oxygen intertank flange was completed on 23 november 45 nasa also performed backscatter scanning of the lower liquid hydrogen intertank flange stringers on 29 november program managers identified the analysis and repairs that were required to safely launch the shuttle and this analysis was reviewed at a special program requirements control board prcb held on 24 november managers announced at that meeting that the launch window available in early december would be passed up with a new target of 17 december set but cautioned that the launch could slip into february 2011 after reviewing the space december traffic model following the realigned johannes kepler atv s launch date nasa had identified a potential launch window in mid late december 2010 the 17 december 2010 date was preferred because it would have allowed the shuttle to carry more stored oxygen to the international space station to help it deal with oxygen generation issues which the crew had dealt with for several months 46 what told the agency leadership is that clearly not ready for the 3 december to 7 december window coming up next week john shannon ssp manager said in a news conference held after the special pcrb leave the option open for a launch window for 17 december but a lot of data has to come together to support that 47 johannes kepler atv rescheduled edit the launch date of 24 february 2011 was officially set after the flight readiness review meeting on 18 february 2011 reviews of previous problems including the gup vent line connection external tank foam and external tank stringer cracks were found to be positive additionally flight rules which required a 72 hour separation between dockings at the international space station threatened to delay the launch by at least a day due to the delayed launch of the esa s unmanned johannes kepler atv supply craft managers instead decided to press ahead with the countdown allowing for a possible standdown had docking issues arisen with the atv sts 133 would have stood down for 48 hours 48 the kepler atv docked successfully at 10 59 utc 24 february

extended by two days one at a time 24 february flight day 1 launch edit space shuttle discovery successfully lifted off from kennedy space center s launch pad 39a at 16 53 24 est on 24 february 2011 liftoff was initially set for 16 50 24 but was delayed for 3 minutes by a minor glitch in a computer system used by the range safety officer rso for the eastern range once discovery was cleared for launch it took 8 minutes and 34 seconds to reach orbit at approximately four minutes into flight a piece of foam was seen breaking away from the external tank this foam was deemed not to be a threat since it was liberated after the shuttle had left atmosphere during discovery s ascent nasa managers also reported that they saw three more additional instances of foam liberation 62 these losses also occurred after aerodynamic sensitive times when debris could seriously damage the shuttle and so were deemed non threatening engineers accounted the foam losses to a condition called cryo pumping when the external tank is loaded with liquid hydrogen the air trapped in the foam first liquifies during the ride into orbit as the hydrogen level in the tank drops it warms up and the liquefied air turns back into a gas the pressure generated due to the state change of hydrogen can cause parts of foam in the tank to come off 63 once on orbit the crew of sts 133 opened the payload bay doors and activated the k u band antenna for high speed communications with mission control while the k u band antenna was being activated alvin drew and pilot eric boe activated the shuttle remote manipulator system srms also known as the canadarm later in the day imagery of the external tank during launch was downlinked for analysis 64 space shuttle discovery rockets into orbit for the final time 24

the crew of discovery begin their preparations to dock with the international space station iss the day started with a firing of the orbital maneuvering system oms engine called the nc2 burn to help discovery catch up to the iss commander steve lindsey pilot eric boe and mission specialist al drew began the day performing an inspection of the re enforced carbon carbon rcc panels with the orbital boom sensor system obss lindsey and boe started the inspection on the starboard wing and nose cap and continued on with the port wing the whole survey took about six hours to complete drew joined up with michael barratt and steve bowen to checkout and get their two extravehicular mobility units emus ready for the two spacewalks that would be conducted during the mission later in the day the crew checked out the rendezvous tools to ensure they were operational at the end of the day another oms engine firing known as the nc3 burn took place 65 26 february flight day 3 iss rendezvous edit the orbiter docked to the iss on flight day 3 marking the 13th time discovery had visited the iss the docking occurred on time at 19 14 utc a hard mate between the two vehicles was delayed by about 40 minutes because of relative motion between the station and shuttle thus putting the crew behind the timeline for the day the hatches were finally opened at 21 16 utc and the expedition 26 crew greeted the crew of sts 133 66 after the welcome ceremony and safety briefing the main task of the day was to transfer the express logistics carrier 4 elc 4 elc 4 was taken out of payload bay by the space station remote manipulator ssrms also known as canadarm2 which was operated by nicole stott and michael barratt the ssrms handed it to the shuttle remote manipulator system srms which was being

from the starboard sill of payload bay once it was grappled and out of the payload bay the shuttle remote manipulator system grappled the end of the obss and took a hand off from the canadarm2 the obss was grappled by the space station arm because the srms could not reach it due to clearance issues and it needed to be moved out of the way so that the permanent multipurpose module pmm could be
