pad 39a of the kennedy space center on 8 june 2007 atlantis lifted off from the launch pad at 19 38 edt damage from a hail storm on 26 february 2007 had previously caused the launch to be postponed from an originally planned launch date of 15 march 2007 the launch of sts 117 marked the 250th orbital human spaceflight 4 atlantis delivered to the international space station iss the second starboard truss segment the s3 s4 truss and its associated energy systems including a set of solar arrays during the course of the mission the crew installed the new truss segment retracted one set of solar arrays and unfolded the new set on the starboard side of the station sts 117 also brought expedition 15 crewmember clayton anderson to the station and returned with iss crewmember sunita williams on 11 june 2007 nasa mission managers announced a two day extension of the mission adding a fourth extra vehicular activity eva these two days were inserted into the mission timeline after flight day 8 this possibility had been discussed prior to launch because of launch day and thus rendezvous day uncertainty the decision to extend was deferred until after launch the repair of the gap

station iss 2 manufactured by the boeing company s3 s4 is the heaviest station payload the shuttle has ever carried 8 the main functions of the s3 s4 truss segments are to provide electrical power and data interfaces for electronics and convert sunlight to electricity they also provide active thermal protection to electrical components throughout the space station and allow the connection of platforms to store spare parts s3 s4 segments were the second starboard addition to the iss truss structure after the s1 truss was attached during atlantis sts 112 mission both s3 s4 were handed off to nasa in september 2002 s3 s3 measures 44 feet long by 16 feet wide by 15 feet high and weighs during flight day 4 activities the s3 s4 truss segment was removed from the payload bay of atlantis using the robotic arm and handed off to the canadarm2 where it was maneuvered and mated to the outboard end of the s1 truss starboard 3 edit post sts 117 station configuration with the newly installed s3 s4 truss segment the s3 primary structure is made of a hexagonal shaped aluminum structure and includes four bulkheads and six longerons beams that connect the bulkheads the secondary structure includes brackets fittings attach platforms eva activity equipment and miscellaneous mechanisms s3 was delivered to the space station processing facility at kennedy space center on 7 december 2000 the major s3 subsystems include the solar array rotary joint sarj segment to segment attach system ssas and payload attach system pas the sarj continuously rotates to keep the solar array wings saws on s4 and s6 launched on shuttle mission in march 2009 oriented toward the sun as the iss orbits the earth the s3 also provides a passive attachment point to the s1 segment via the ssas the pas allows platforms to be attached to s3 for the storage of additional science payloads or spare orbital replacement units orus starboard 4 edit major subsystems of the s4 truss are the port inboard photovoltaic module pvm the photovoltaic radiator pvr the alpha joint interface structure ajis and the modified rocketdyne truss attachment system mrtas the primary functions of the pvms are to collect convert store and distribute electrical power to loads within the segment and to other station segments there are two saws on the s4 each deployed in the opposite direction from each other each saw is made up of two solar blankets mounted to a common mast and measures 115 feet by 38 feet in addition to the sarj the saws also are oriented by the beta gimbal assembly bga which can change the pitch of the wings by spinning the solar array the pvr is deployable on orbit and is capable of dissipating up to of heat into space the pvr weighs 1,633 pounds and when deployed measures 44 by 12 by 7 feet the ajis provides the structural transition between s3 and s4 structures s4 contains the passive side of the mrtas which provides the structural attachment for s5 on s4 s4 was delivered to the space station processing facility at kennedy space center on 15 january 2001 hydrogen vent valve edit atlantis carried a hydrogen vent valve in its mid deck to the space station the valve used to vent hydrogen overboard is part of the oxygen generation system ogs the ogs helps to produce oxygen for the crew to replace oxygen lost due to experiment use airlock depressurization and venting other items edit other items carried on the mid deck included a contingency water container for transferring water to the iss a tool modified torque multiplier for removing s3 launch restraints and audio interface hardware to troubleshoot shuttle to station communication difficulties experienced during sts 115 and sts 116 the payload weight for the mid deck during sts 117 was less than 1,000 pounds among numerous cargo atlantis carried into space an almost 400 year old artifact a metal cargo tag etched with the name of its destination yames towne from historic jamestown along with four commemorative coins to honor early american explorers 9 10 a 17th century metal worker had prepared a tag to mark cargo heading for the new world the tag was unearthed in 2006 at jamestown the

march 2007 following hailstorm damage sts 117 was originally planned to launch on 16 march but the launch date was later moved forward in order to extend the launch window and increase the chances of a successful launch within that time frame in preparation for this earlier launch date atlantis was transported to the vehicle assembly building on 7 february 2007 first motion was at 06 19 est 13 following the arrival of the shuttle in the assembly facility atlantis was fitted with two bridge cranes that lifted her vertically to position her for mating to the external fuel tank and solid rocket boosters already in place atop the mobile launcher platform the mating of the orbiter to the stack occurred on 12 february 2007 the rest of the pre launch preparations also continued to proceed according to plans with the payload canister containing the s3 s4 truss and a set of solar arrays arriving at the launch pad at 02 54 est on 12 february 2007 the canister lift began at 05 40 est the same morning ready for transfer of the iss truss segments and other cargo into the payload changeout room on the newly refurbished rotating service structure of pad 39a 14 atlantis was originally scheduled to begin her rollout to launch pad 39a the first shuttle launch at 39a in four years on 14 february 2007 however due to erratic chamber pressure readings on one of the operational pressure transducers opts on the forward skirt area of the right hand srb the rollout was delayed to 07 00 est on the morning of 15 february 2007 15 various problems including a generator transfer issue to the mobile launcher platform meant that first movement of the stack was delayed from the scheduled rollout time and did not occur until 08 19 est the 3 4 mile six hour journey to the launchpad concluded that afternoon with atlantis arriving at the launch pad at 15 09 est it was decided that the issue with the opt would be solved on the launch pad a task which may require all six transducers on the sts 117 stack being removed and replaced 16 on 21 february 2007 the sts 117 crew traveled from houston to the kennedy space center ksc to participate in the terminal countdown demonstration test tcdt the astronauts were at ksc from february 2007 during which time they practiced launch activities carried out safety exercises inspected the payload and concluded the test with a simulated main engine cut off exercise 17 they then returned to houston via t 38 jets planning to return to ksc a few days before launch the next milestone in the launch preparations was the flight readiness review from february 2007 during which time managers engineers and contractors examined the readiness of the space shuttle flight crew and payloads to determine whether everything was set to proceed for launch hail damage edit external tank et 124 shows hailstorm damage technicians repair the et nose cone following a hailstorm at ksc on 26 february 2007 inspections of the stack found damage to the shuttle and the external tank hailstones as large as golf balls had created around divots in the foam insulation damaged at least one ice frost ramp on the tank and caused minor surface damage to about 26 heat shield tiles on atlantis s left wing on 4 march 2007 the sts 117 stack was similarly rolled back into the vab following additional inspections repairs to the orbiter and tank were carried out to return atlantis to flight readiness after completion of the repairs atlantis along with her distinctly speckled external tank was rolled out to pad 39a for the second time during the morning of 15 may 2007 a second flight readiness review took place on may 2007 18 the hail damage to atlantis caused major changes to the shuttle launch manifest at that time pushing sts 118 back to 8 august 2007 which could not have flown until the installation of the s3 s4 truss segment carried by atlantis was completed sts 120 back to 23 october 2007 and return on sts 122 back to a targeted launch date on 6 december 2007 19 20 atlantis on sts 122 eventually lifted off on 7 february 2008 aging problem edit main article space shuttle atlantis overwrapped pressure vessels nasa announced that it is possible albeit unlikely that one of 24 composite overwrap pressure vessels onboard atlantis could burst before launch damaging the orbiter a burst of a vessel during launch could have resulted in the loss of the shuttle and crew nasa changed the launch procedure for atlantis to counter this problem and reduce any risk to personnel and the shuttle 21 mission timeline edit 8 june flight day 1 launch edit

during its first full day in orbit crewmembers aboard atlantis inspected the heat shield the crew was given an extra half hour to sleep after being kept up late to finish downloading in cabin video 26 pilot lee archambault and mission specialists patrick forrester and steven swanson used the robotic arm and orbiter boom sensor system obss to inspect the heat shield on wing leading edges and nose cap 27 based on lessons learned during the previous three post columbia missions during sts 117 the crew used new inspection procedures devised by nasa the scans took less time covered a larger area and they used a camera on the end of the obss to take close up photographs at the same time the laser scanner was collecting data 28 the astronauts started with the starboard wing leading edge making multiple passes up and down the wing to cover all the angles after scanning the nose cap they moved on to the port wing and repeated the procedure the crew also down linked mission control houston engineers up close video of the displaced portion of the blanket on the port orbital maneuvering system pod 29 while the robotic arm survey proceeded mission specialists olivas james reilly and clayton anderson conducted a thorough checkout of the spacesuits to be worn during the spacewalks planned for the docked operations at the space station and prepared them and other eva hardware for transfer to the space station the crew also installed a centerline camera extend the outer ring of the orbiter docking system and checked out rendezvous tools 10 june flight day 3 docking edit space shuttle atlantis performs the rpm atlantis crew was awakened at 13 08 utc 30 guided by the terminal insertion burn to refine the closed in on the iss before the shuttle docked at a distance of 600 feet below the station sts 117 commander rick sturckow performed what is known as the rendezvous pitch maneuver rpm the back flip rpm allowed station crewmembers fyodor yurchikhin and oleg kotov to photograph heat shield tiles on the underside using long range high resolution cameras atlantis docked to destiny pressurized mating adapter 2 on the iss at 19 36 utc while the two spacecraft were traveling 220 miles above the northeast coast of australia 31 a few minutes later hooks and latches were activated to firmly pull the two spacecraft together after leak checks to make sure the interface is airtight the hatch between them was opened at 21 20 utc and the station crew welcomed the shuttle crew 8 shortly after welcoming the shuttle crew station flight engineer oleg kotov and shuttle mission specialist clayton anderson transferred customized soyuz seat liner into the russian spacecraft in place of that of flight engineer suni williams the transfer marked the official swap of anderson for williams as a station crewmember following docking pilot lee archambault and mission specialist patrick forrester used the canadarm to grapple the s3 s4 truss lift it from its berth in the payload bay and maneuver it for handover to the canadarm2 after hatch opening suni williams used the canadarm2 to take the truss from the robotic arm that task was completed at 00 28 utc marking the completion of the handover the truss remained grappled to the arm until next installation mission specialists james reilly and john danny olivas spent the night in the quest airlock as part of the overnight campout procedure to help them get prepared for next spacewalk the iss seen from atlantis the sts 117 crewmembers give the station crewmembers packages 11 june flight day 4 eva 1 edit mission specialists reilly and olivas participates in eva 1 pilot archambault mission specialist forrester and station flight engineer kotov used the ssrms to mate the s3 s4 truss to the outboard end of the s1 truss the installation paved the way for the start of the spacewalk planned for the day after venturing out of the quest airlock into space mission specialists reilly and olivas released launch restraints on the four solar array blanket boxes which house the folded solar arrays they made final attachment of bolts cables and connectors and began preparations for the activation of the truss the two spacewalkers rotated the array canisters into their normal position for deployment on the next day the start of the spacewalk was delayed for about an hour after the station temporarily lost attitude control when the control moment gyroscopes cmgs went offline 32 the spacewalk started after gyroscopes were initialized by flight controllers eva 1 marked the 84th devoted to the iss assembly and maintenance 33 it was also the fourth for reilly and first for olivas mission management team also decided to extend atlantis mission by two days and to add a fourth spacewalk 34 john shannon the head of sts 117 mission management team during the mission briefing told reporters that the extra time would give the crew to complete the iss assembly tasks and allow ground engineers to draw up plans to repair the damaged blanket on the oms pod of atlantis 35 nasa deemed that the torn blanket while not a flight risk to the shuttle crew during reentry could lead to some damage to the oms internal honeycomb like graphite epoxy structure such a damage would require additional time to repair once the shuttle returns to earth nasa said james reilly left and john olivas during eva 1 astronaut james reilly participate in eva 1 james reilly right and john olivas during eva 1 12 june flight day 5 solar array deployment edit sts 117 crewmembers in the destiny laboratory the successful deployment of the s3 s4 solar arrays was the highlight of the day adding significantly to the iss power generation capabilities 36 prior to crew wake up station controllers began unfurling the solar array attached to the s3 s4 truss segment shuttle crew then took over unfolding one wing at a time in stages pausing to let the sun warm the solar array panels which helped to prevent the thin individual panels from sticking together 37 the crew finished unfolding the first wing at cdt and the second at cdt there were continuing problems with the electrically driven gyroscopes the preferred non propulsive method for controlling the iss due to a problem with a russian navigation computer 38 the navigation computer problem started when flight controllers attempted to turn attitude control over to the iss computers after letting shuttle computers handle it while the arrays were unfolded the navigation computer would not allow them to do so and forced a reboot of the main russian command and control computer the forced reboot triggered an alarm enunciating the problem to the crew and ground controllers the issues appeared to have been resolved by the end of the day and the gyroscopes took over attitude control shortly after cdt that was followed by relocation of the mobile transporter in preparation ahead the next spacewalk the crew or shuttle station combined stack never was in danger throughout the troubleshooting efforts 13 june flight day 6 eva 2 edit astronaut steven swanson participates in eva 2 flight day 6 saw mission specialists patrick forrester and steven swanson perform the second of four planned spacewalks the main task of the spacewalk was to prepare the solar alpha rotary joint sarj between the s3 and s4 truss segments for rotation 39 40 the two spacewalkers and their crew mates were awakened at 13 08 utc to begin the activities mission specialists john olivas and sunita williams helped forrester and swanson to get readied with the eva commander sturckow pilot archambault and mission specialist jim reilly worked the early steps of retraction of the 2b solar array wing on the starboard side of the p6 truss they sent commands and monitored the retraction after exiting quest at 18 03 utc the two spacewalkers moved up the p6 truss to monitor the retraction of the 2b sollar array and to assist if required forrester was in a foot restraint on the canadarm2 and swanson had specially prepared tools to use to help the panels of photovoltaic cells fold properly flight controllers were able to get seven and a half of the 31.5 solar array bays folded then forrester and swanson were able to poke and prod another five and a half bays worth of panels into folding correctly some 45 feet before moving on to the sarj forrester and swanson completed eva 2 with mixed results 41 the duo removed all of the launch locks holding the sarj in place the spacewalkers had planned to remove the launch restraints as well but ran into problem when forrester tried to install a drive lock assembly they discovered that the s3 s4 sarj motor control circuits were wired in reverse as such commands being sent to the drive lock assembly were actually being received by a drive lock assembly that was installed during eva 1 so one launch lock restraint was left in place to prevent the possibility of undesired rotation 42 eva 2 marked the 85th spacewalk devoted to station assembly and maintenance as eva 2 progressed mission managers approved a repair task for the damaged thermal blanket to be carried out during the next spacewalk eva 3 overnight the russian flight controllers also worked to resolve the problem with the russian segment computers during the day with the propulsion providing backup the control moment gyroscopes were handling attitude control mission specialists swanson and forrester in the midst of the pre breathe exercise mission specialist patrick forrester during eva 2 mission specialist steven swanson during eva 2 crew members give a thumbs up signal at the conclusion of eva 2 14 june flight day 7 edit a computer malfunction on the russian segments of the iss occurred at 06 30 utc and left the space station without orientation control a successful restart of the computers resulted in a false fire alarm which awakened the crew at 11 43 utc engineers theorized that the new s4 solar array or components in the circuitry delivering that power to the russian segment of the iss triggered some subtle change in the iss electrical grid 43 the solar array blanket atop the p6 truss was furled to a little more than half its original length by the atlantis and the station crews commander rick sturckow along with pilot lee archambault mission specialist sunita williams and flight engineer clayton anderson meticulously retracted the solar array blanket another three bays worth of panels the crew carefully sent commands to retract the array as much as possible ahead of eva 3 by last count 15 and a half of the 31 and half bays remained to be folded into a 20 inch deep protective box mission specialists james reilly and john olivas completed a review of procedures for eva 3 before going to sleep the crew also talked about the mission with radio and television stations after that reilly and olivas slept in the quest airlock for spacewalk pre breathe campout protocol 44 15 june flight day 8 eva 3 edit astronaut john olivas moves toward atlantis port oms pod the wakeup call came at cdt 45 flight day 8 was dedicated to third spacewalk eva 3 to repair the thermal blanket on atlantis and assist in folding up a solar array on the space station spacewalkers james reilly and john olivas began eva 3 when the two astronauts switched their spacesuits into internal battery power and exited into space from the quest airlock it was the 86th eva dedicated to iss assembly and maintenance and the ninth for year 2007 46 while olivas anchored to the end of atlantis robot arm was repairing the oms pod reilly installed an external hydrogen vent for the oxygen generating system inside destiny laboratory by using his helmet camera olivas beamed down close up views of the torn insulation and surrounding blankets to help flight controllers assess the condition olivas spent two hours stapling and pinning down a thermal blanket on the oms pod 47 flight controllers from houston also radioed reilly that they had decided to have him disconnect the p 12 connector that was installed during eva 1 since the russian flight controllers were planning to make an attempt to restart the problematic computers in the iss even though the connector was not in use at that time engineers decided to have reilly disconnect it to make sure that it was not causing any electrical noise or grounding issues that might have played a role in the computer trouble when those tasks were completed the two astronauts along with their colleagues inside the shuttle and station and flight controllers in houston completed the final retraction of the starboard p6 truss element the retraction that required 28 commands was completed and latches closed seven hours 15 minutes into the spacewalk at cdt the successful folding paved the way to relocate the p6 truss to its permanent location during sts 120 all tasks were completed successfully on during the 7 hours 58 minute eva activities earlier on the day u s and russian engineers disconnected u s electrical power from the russian computer system but isolating the computers from u s power did not resolve the problem the primary russian computers were brought back online by bypassing a circuit secondary systems were left offline pending further work 48 49 astronauts james reilly on robot arm and john olivas during eva

reached 188 days and 4 hours matching the mark for the longest single spaceflight ever by a woman space traveler 52 that mark was set by astronaut shannon lucid on her flight to the mir space station in 1996 by coincidence williams also set the new record on the 44th anniversary of the launch of the first female space flyer valentina tereshkova in 1963 53 crew members spent time transferring supplies between iss and atlantis later on the day they reviewed the timeline for next spacewalk mission specialists james reilly john olivas steven swanson and patrick forrester spent time working on the u s spacesuits olivas and reilly finished their post spacewalk spacesuit reconfiguration tasks while forrester and swanson configured their suits and tools for eva 4 the shuttle and space station crew also spoke with reporters during a space to ground news conference earlier in the day flight controllers in moscow issued commands to restart some systems in the russian segment of the space station during the day computer problems on the iss were further resolved with all six processors available four online and two standby 50 following the successful attempt to revive four channels on flight day 8 after bypassing what appeared to be a faulty power switch with external cabling cosmonauts fyodor yurchikhin and oleg kotov repeated that same modification on the last two channels 54 17 june flight day 10 eva 4 edit mission specialists patrick forrester left and steven swanson participate in eva 4 the wakeup call went up at cdt 55 flight day 10 saw the successful completion of the final spacewalk by patrick forrester and steven swanson the fourth spacewalk of sts 117 began at 16 25 utc 56 astronaut james reilly choreographed the activity from atlantis flight deck shadowed by station flight engineer oleg kotov serving as the intravehicular crew member eva 4 was the 87th in support of station assembly and maintenance 11th spacewalk completed in 2007 the 59th staged out of the iss and the 36th out of the quest airlock 57 swanson and forrester retrieved a tv camera and its support structure from a stowage platform attached to the quest airlock and installed it on the s3 truss they then verified the drive lock assembly dla 2 configuration and removed the last six sarj launch restraints 58 the two astronauts cleared the path on the s3 truss for the mobile base system by removing temporary rail stops and hardware that had secured the s3 s4 truss segments in the payload bay the work completed the major tasks assigned for the sts 117 mission the pair then began some of the get ahead tasks mission managers had hoped to complete the two spacewalkers installed a computer network cable on the unity node that was to permit astronauts in the u s segment of the station to command systems in the russian segment and opened the hydrogen vent valve on the destiny laboratory installed by mission specialist james reilly during eva 3 swanson and forrester also attempted to bolt down two debris shield panels that could not be put back in place during an earlier spacewalk since the two were also not able to get it anchored they tethered the panels on the space service module overnight ground controllers planned to test the sarj ordering a small 5 degree rotation just to verify normal operations 59 throughout flight day 10 the russian central computer and terminal computers continued in stable operation 18 june flight day 11 off duty edit sts 117 crew got up looking ahead to time off duty during the first half of flight day 11 the astronauts hauled the last bits of cargo between the shuttle and the space station while flight controllers on earth tested the resuscitated russian control and navigation computers after they crashed last week in the morning the shuttle maneuvered the atlantis iss complex into position for a water and waste water dump and after it maneuvered back attitude control was switched to and from russian command successfully 60

specialist patrick forrester began powering on shuttle systems that have been turned off to conserve power during the docked phase of the mission at 13 28 utc mission specialists steven swanson and james reilly installed the centerline camera in the orbiter docking system 62 at the hooks and latches holding atlantis and iss together were released and the shuttle undocked from the space station as the two spacecraft were flying above new guinea 63 64 atlantis was docked to the station for 8 days and 19 hours pilot lee archambault took control of atlantis shortly after undocking and fired shuttle thrusters to move 450 feet in front of the iss before starting a full fly around at 15 07 utc crew members on both the iss and shuttle got photos of both spacecraft as atlantis performed the fly around and once it was complete the shuttle left of the vicinity of the station complex 65 during the separation a camera in the cargo of atlantis bay observed numerous objects what could have been harmless pieces of ice and one much larger more distinct piece of debris slowly floating away it was not clear whether the objects originated from the shuttle or the space station around 21 30 utc commander sturckow reported yet another piece of debris leaving the area of atlantis sturckow identified them to the mission control in houston as little phenolic looking kind of tan looking washers with four slots that are used to tie down the multi layer insulation blankets in the payload bay later in the day pilot archambault mission specialists forrester and swanson used the robot arm to lift the orbiter boom sensor system to conduct a late inspection of the thermal protection system on both wings and the nose cap during the day astronaut sunita williams in the 192nd day of her spaceflight did more exercise to help prepare her to gravity back on earth 20 june flight day 13 edit atlantis did various hardware tests to prepare for a landing on 21 june 2007 and the crew had an

day 15 saw space shuttle atlantis returned to earth after a successful mission to the space station earlier in the day the flight controllers kept a close eye on weather atlantis again closed its payload bay doors and made preparations for landing atlantis had five opportunities to land two at kennedy space center three at edwards air force base california 67 the first and second landing attempts on orbit 218 and 219 in florida were scrubbed due to showers thunderstorms and low clouds at kennedy space center so flight controllers took their first chance at edwards air force base where weather was ideal for the landing flying upside down and backward over the indian ocean the deorbit burn was initiated by commander rick sturckow and pilot lee archambault they fired atlantis twin oms pods at 18 43 47 utc for 2 minutes and 33 seconds slowing the ship by about 68 69 this was enough to drop the shuttle into the atmosphere for an hour long glide back to earth as the shuttle descended through 50,000 feet commander sturckow took over manual control and guided atlantis successfully to land on runway 22 at edwards air force base at 19 49 38 utc flight surgeons were standing by to assist astronaut sunita williams who made the trip back to earth resting on her back in a recumbent seat bolted to the floor of the lower deck during her long duration flight williams spent 194 days

up calls edit in what has become a tradition for nasa spaceflights since the days of gemini the crew of sts 117 is played a special musical track at the start of each day in space each track is

unfurled banner of red white and blue represent the renewed patriotism of the american nation as they continue to explore the universe contingency planning edit main article sts 3xx sts 317 edit sts 317 was the designation given to the contingency shuttle crew support mission which would have been launched in the event space shuttle discovery became disabled during sts 116 it would have been a modified version of the sts 117 mission which would have involved the launch date being brought forward if needed it would have launched no earlier than 21 february 2007 the crew for this mission would have been a 4 person subset of the full sts 117 crew incorrect press reports of accident edit on 9 june 2007 the french news agency agence france presse afp reported that atlantis had exploded shortly after take off 74 75 the information circulated on their wire for a number of minutes and appeared on a number of websites including and romandie news 76 it was later reported that afp had prepared this sort of bulletin for every shuttle launch since the 1986 space shuttle challenger disaster and accidentally published it 75 this is equivalent to accidental automated press releases in the past such as the infamous case of nbc erroneously reporting joe dimaggio s death in 1999 about six weeks before his actual death see also edit spaceflight portal 2007 in spaceflight list of human
