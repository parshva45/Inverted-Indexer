american module the unity node to the station 2 the seven day mission was highlighted by the mating of the u s built unity node to the functional cargo block zarya module already in orbit and three spacewalks to connect power and data transmission cables between the node and the fgb zarya built by boeing and the russian space agency was launched on a russian proton rocket from the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan in november 1998 1 other payloads on the sts 88 mission included the imax cargo bay camera icbc the argentine scientific applications satellite s sac a the mightysat 1

mission highlights edit sts 88 launches from kennedy space center 4 december 1998 the iss after sts 88 construction illustration of the international space station after sts 88 node 1 named unity was the first space station hardware delivered by the space shuttle it has two pressurized mating adapters pma one attached to either end one pma is permanently mated to zarya and the other is used for orbiter dockings and crew access to the station unity also contains an international standard payload rack used to support on orbit activities which was activated after the fifth shuttle station assembly flight 1 to begin the assembly sequence the crew conducted a series of rendezvous maneuvers similar to those conducted on other shuttle missions to reach the orbiting fgb on the way currie used the robot arm to place node 1 atop the orbiter docking system 5 6 cabana completed the rendezvous by flying endeavour to within 10 metres of the fgb allowing currie to capture the fgb with the robot arm and place it on the pressurized mating adapter 7 once the two elements were docked ross and newman conducted two scheduled spacewalks to connect power and data cables between the node pmas and the fgb 8 the day following the spacewalks endeavour undocked from the two components completing the first space station assembly mission 9 10 astronauts toured the new international space station on 11 december 1998 entering the unity and zarya modules for the first time and establishing an s band communications system that enables u s flight controllers to monitor the systems 11 12 reflecting the international cooperation involved in building the largest space complex in history commander robert cabana and russian cosmonaut sergei krikalev opened the hatch to the u s built unity connecting module and floated into the new station together 12 the rest of the crew followed and began turning on lights and unstowing gear in the roomy hub to which other modules would be connected in the future each passageway within unity was marked by a sign leading the way into tunnels to which new modules would later be connected 12 about an hour later robert cabana and sergei krikalev opened the hatch to the russian built zarya control module which was the nerve center for the station in its embryonic stage joined by pilot frederick sturckow and mission specialists jerry ross james h newman and nancy currie cabana and krikalev hailed the historic entrance into the international space station and said the hatch opening signified the start of a new era in space exploration 12 sts 88 lands at the shuttle landing facility 15 december 1998 ross and newman went right to work in unity completing the assembly of an early s band communications system that allows flight controllers in houston to send commands to systems and to keep tabs on the health of the station with a more extensive communications capability than exists through russian ground stations 12 the astronauts also conducted a successful test of the videoconferencing capability of the early communications system which was used by the first crew to permanently occupy the station in november 2000 expedition 1 newman downlinked greetings to controllers in the station flight control room in houston and to astronaut bill shepherd who commanded the first crew and lived aboard the station with krikalev and cosmonaut yuri gidzenko citation needed krikalev and currie replaced a faulty unit in zarya which controlled the discharging of stored energy from one of the six batteries the battery had not been working properly in its automatic configuration but the new unit was functioning normally shortly after it was installed citation needed the astronauts also unstowed hardware and logistical supplies stored behind panels in zarya relocating the items for use by the shuttle crew that was to visit the station in may 1999 and by expedition crew the astronauts also completed their initial outfitting of the station citation needed the hatches to zarya and unity were closed before endeavour undocked from the new station leaving the new complex to orbit the earth unpiloted 13 mission timeline edit launch preparations edit at est on monday 23 june 1997 an air force c 5 air cargo plane arrived at the shuttle landing facility carrying unity node 1 14 on 1 february 1998 endeavour was towed to orbiter processing facility bay 1 15 on 15 october 1998 endeavour was moved from orbiter processing facility bay 1 to the vehicle assembly building 16 on 21 october 1998 endeavour was transported atop the crawler transporter to kennedy space center s launch pad 39a 17 december flight day 1 launch edit space shuttle endeavour launched at est from the kennedy space center launch pad 39a sts 88 was the first shuttle flight to the international space station after launch the crew opened the payload bay doors deployed the ku band antenna and activated the hitchhiker payload the crew also started preparing for the multiple engine firings that will be performed to bring shuttle endeavour within the shuttle remote manipulator system reach of the zarya fgb at launch zarya was 240 statute miles above the kennedy space center ksc and the module was on its 222nd orbit of the earth since its launch 18 4 december flight day 2 edit on flight day 2 the crew of shuttle endeavour performed several tasks to get ready for the docking on sunday and the extra vehicular activities eva to be completed on the mission nancy currie conducted a photo survey of unity and endeavour payload bay using the robotic arm canadarm jerry ross and jim newman checked out the spacesuits they would use on the three evas and prepared the airlock for use during the spacewalks rick sturckow who would be choreographing the evas from inside the shuttle joined ross and newman to check out the safer units to be worn during the spacewalks in case ross or newman were to become separated from endeavour during one of the spacewalks 19 5 december flight day 3 edit on flight day 3 currie used canadarm to grapple and place unity onto the orbiter docking system at est the crew pressurized pma 2 and entered it they put several caps over vent valves to prepare for the entrance into unity later in the week commander bob cabana performed a debris avoidance maneuver to move endeavour out of the way of a casing from a delta ii rocket that launched on 6 november from vandenberg air force base in california 5 6 december flight day 4 docking with zarya edit on flight day 4 bob cabana fired endeavour rockets several times to maneuver the shuttle within canadarm reach of the zarya fgb at est currie grappled zarya later at est cabana fired endeavour downward jets to bring the two modules together 20 7 december flight day 5 eva 1 edit during a 7 hour 21 minute flight day 5 spacewalk astronauts jerry ross and jim newman helped activate the unity node the first module to the u s segment of the
