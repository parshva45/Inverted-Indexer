994 hpa mbar 29.35 inhg fatalities none reported damage none areas affected somalia part of the 2004 north indian ocean cyclone season severe cyclonic storm agni was a tropical cyclone of the 2004 north indian ocean cyclone season notable for its record proximity to the equator it was the second north indian ocean cyclone to receive a name after onil earlier in the year agni formed on well to the southwest of india in the arabian sea and steadily intensified as it tracked northwestward the joint typhoon warning center jtwc estimated peak sustained winds of while the india meteorological department imd estimated peak sustained winds of the imd is the official warning center for the north indian ocean after peaking it weakened due to wind shear dry air and cooler waters and the jtwc issued its final advisory on as it approached the coast of somalia the remnants of agni moved along the somalian coastline until dissipating on contents 1 meteorological history 2 records naming and impact 3 see also 4 references meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the scale a tropical disturbance was observed on about southeast of colombo sri lanka in the bay of bengal 1 the disturbance tracked westward gradually organizing and prompting the jtwc to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert tcfa on after passing south of sri lanka it became disorganized and was no longer considered likely to develop into a tropical cyclone 2 the circulation associated with the system continued westward reorganizing on in the arabian sea 1 despite being located unusually close to the equator the disturbance maintained convection or thunderstorms which was becoming organized around the weak low level circulation with low wind shear and diffluence aloft the jtwc remarked the system had a fair chance of developing 3 while the system was organizing the center crossed the equator to reach about s thus becoming an anticyclonic circulation in the southern hemisphere this was unusual as the coriolis effect is nonexistent along the coriolis effect refers to planetary vorticity which provides the spin in a cyclone 1 4 the jtwc later assessed the system as remaining in the northern hemisphere reaching as far south as or about from the equator 5 after the circulation organized further beneath the convection the jtwc issued another tcfa at 0300 utc on 6 three hours later the agency classified the system as tropical cyclone 05a about southwest of the southern tip of india 7 in a post season analysis the jtwc estimated the cyclone became a tropical storm six hours earlier 5 at around the same time the imd classified it as a low pressure area likely to become well marked 8 upon being classified the tropical cyclone was moving northwestward under the influence of a ridge over india its outflow to the north and south became better defined although its proximity to the equator limited its southerly outflow somewhat due to wind shear 9 early on the imd classified the system as a depression 10 and throughout the day it rapidly intensified to become a cyclonic storm a cyclonic storm is a tropical cyclone with at least winds sustained for 11 around that time the jtwc assessed the cyclone as reaching peak winds of sustained for along with gusts to late on the cyclone weakened slightly only to regain its peak intensity by 5 at that time it developed a banding eye and was located about southeast of the coast of somalia 12 at on the imd issued its first complete advisory on the cyclone naming it severe cyclonic storm agni and estimating peak winds at the agency predicted the storm would continue northwestward and strengthen slightly before weakening 13 at its peak the cyclone had a barometric pressure of 985 mbar 14 cyclone agni near peak intensity after reaching peak intensity an increase in wind shear caused the eye to disappear 15 and the convection decreased significantly 16 on the imd estimated agni weakened to cyclonic storm status 17 around which time the center became exposed from the convection 18 the cyclone continued its steady weakening continued due to the wind shear the presence of dry air and cooler water temperatures 19 and by the imd downgraded agni to depression status which was its final warning on the system 20 as it approached the coast of somalia it turned westward due to the building of a ridge over saudi arabia 21 despite unfavorable conditions thunderstorms briefly reformed over the circulation which allowed the storm to maintain its intensity 22 by late on agni weakened to below tropical storm status and the jtwc issued its final warning while the storm was about south southeast of cape guardafui easternmost point of the horn of africa 23 the circulation became difficult to locate by early on by which time the system had little remaining convection 24 it turned southwestward and later to the south moving ashore on eastern somalia before dissipating on near ceel huur over water 5 records naming and impact edit according to rsmc new delhi cyclone agni developed into a depression at which is the same latitude as where according to rsmc tokyo tropical storm vamei formed during december 2001 25 26 however according to rsmc la reunion the precursor low to cyclone agni moved into the southern hemisphere and became an anticyclone as it had kept its counter clockwise circulation 27 agni was the second storm in the north indian ocean to receive a name after the imd began tropical cyclone naming in the middle of 2004 28 as the cyclone was weak when it moved over somalia no casualties or significant damage was reported 5 see also edit tropical cyclones portal list of near equatorial tropical cyclones list of tropical cyclones
