list of retired philippine typhoon names wikipedia list of retired philippine typhoon names from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the philippine area of responsibility par for tropical cyclone warnings since 1963 there have been three agencies who have named tropical cyclones within the north western pacific ocean which has often resulted in a cyclone having two names from 1945 to 2000 the us joint typhoon warning center assigned names to tropical cyclones before the japan meteorological agency jma took over the naming of tropical cyclones in 2000 both agencies assigned names to tropical cyclones when they intensified into a tropical storm since 1963 the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa has assigned local names to a tropical cyclone should it move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between and and between even if the cyclone has had an international name assigned to it all three agencies that have assigned names to tropical cyclones within the western pacific have retired the names of significant tropical cyclones with pagasa retiring names if a cyclone has caused at least in damage and or have caused at least within the philippines since 1963 the naming lists have been revised in 1979 1985 2001 and 2005 for various reasons including to help minimize confusion in the historical records and to remove the names that might have negative associations with real persons 1 2 within this list all information with regards to intensity is taken from while the system was in the philippine area of responsibility and is thus taken from archives rather than the jtwc or archives contents 1 pre 2000 2 2000s 3 2010s 4 see also 5 notes 6 references 7 external links pre
