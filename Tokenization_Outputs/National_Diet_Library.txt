at the creation of imperial diet in 1890 and the imperial library which had been established in 1872 under the jurisdiction of the ministry of education the power in prewar japan was limited and its

legislative activity until defeat moreover the executive had controlled all political documents depriving the people and the diet of access to vital information the u s occupation forces under general douglas macarthur deemed reform of the diet library system to be an important part of the democratization of japan after its defeat in world war ii in 1946 each house of the diet formed its own national diet library standing committee hani a marxist historian who had been imprisoned during the war for thought crimes and had been elected to the house of councillors the successor to the abolished house of peers after the war spearheaded the reform efforts hani envisioned the new body as both a citadel of popular sovereignty and the means of realizing a peaceful revolution the
