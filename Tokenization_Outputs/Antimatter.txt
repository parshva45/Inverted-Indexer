physics antimatter is defined as a material composed of the antiparticle or partners to the corresponding particles of ordinary matter in theory a particle and its anti particle have the same mass as one another but opposite electric charge and other differences in quantum numbers for example a proton has positive charge while an antiproton has negative charge a collision between any particle and its anti particle partner is known to lead to their mutual annihilation giving rise to various proportions of intense photons gamma rays neutrinos and sometimes less massive pairs annihilation usually results in a release of energy that becomes available for heat or work the amount of the released energy is usually proportional to the total mass of the collided matter and antimatter in accord with the equivalence equation e mc 2 1 antimatter particles bind with one another to form antimatter just as ordinary particles bind to form normal matter for example a positron the antiparticle of the electron and an antiproton the antiparticle of the proton can form an antihydrogen atom physical principles indicate that complex antimatter atomic nuclei are possible as well as anti atoms corresponding to the known chemical elements there is considerable speculation as to why the observable universe is composed almost entirely of ordinary matter as opposed to an equal mixture of matter and antimatter this asymmetry of matter and antimatter in the visible universe is one of the great unsolved problems in physics 2 the process by which this inequality between matter and antimatter particles developed is called baryogenesis antimatter in the form of anti atoms is one of the most difficult materials to produce individual antimatter particles however are commonly produced by particle accelerators and in some types of radioactive decay the nuclei of antihelium have been artificially produced with difficulty these are the most complex anti nuclei so far observed 3 play

definition edit formally antimatter particles can be defined by their negative baryon number or lepton number while normal non antimatter matter particles have a positive baryon or lepton number 4 5 these two classes of particles are the antiparticle partners of one another history of the concept edit the idea of negative matter appears in past theories of matter that have now been abandoned using the once popular vortex theory of gravity the possibility of matter with negative gravity was discussed by william hicks in the 1880s between the 1880s and the 1890s karl pearson proposed the existence of squirts 6 and sinks of the flow of aether the squirts represented normal matter and the sinks represented negative matter theory required a fourth dimension for the aether to flow from and into 7 the term antimatter was first used by arthur schuster in two rather whimsical letters to nature in 1898 8 in which he coined the term he hypothesized antiatoms as well as whole antimatter solar systems and discussed the possibility of matter and antimatter annihilating each other ideas were not a serious theoretical proposal merely speculation and like the previous ideas differed from the modern concept of antimatter in that it possessed negative gravity 9 the modern theory of antimatter began in 1928 with a paper 10 by paul dirac dirac realised that his relativistic version of the wave equation for electrons predicted the possibility of antielectrons these were discovered by carl d anderson in 1932 and named positrons a portmanteau of positive electron although dirac did not himself use the term antimatter its use follows on naturally enough from antielectrons antiprotons etc 11 a complete periodic table of antimatter was envisaged by charles janet in 1929 12 the interpretation states that antimatter and antiparticles are regular particles traveling backward in time 13 notation edit one way to denote an antiparticle is by adding a bar over the symbol for example the proton and antiproton are denoted as p and p respectively the same rule applies if one were to address a particle by its constituent components a proton is made up of u u d quarks so an antiproton must therefore be formed from u u d antiquarks another convention is to distinguish particles by their electric charge thus the electron and positron are denoted simply as e and e respectively however to prevent confusion the two conventions are never mixed properties edit there are compelling theoretical reasons to believe that aside from the fact that antiparticles have different signs on all charges such as electric charge and spin matter and antimatter have exactly the same properties 14 15 this means a particle and its corresponding antiparticle must have identical masses and decay lifetimes if unstable it also implies that for example a star made up of antimatter an antistar will shine just like an ordinary star 16 this idea was tested experimentally in 2016 by the alpha experiment which measured the transition between the two lowest energy states of antihydrogen the results which are identical to that of hydrogen confirmed the validity of quantum mechanics for antimatter 17 18 origin and asymmetry edit see also baryogenesis almost all matter observable from the earth seems to be made of matter rather than antimatter if antimatter dominated regions of space existed the gamma rays produced in annihilation reactions along the boundary between matter and antimatter regions would be detectable 19 antiparticles are created everywhere in the universe where high energy particle collisions take place high energy cosmic rays impacting atmosphere or any other matter in the solar system produce minute quantities of antiparticles in the resulting particle jets which are immediately annihilated by contact with nearby matter they may similarly be produced in regions like the center of the milky way and other galaxies where very energetic celestial events occur principally the interaction of relativistic jets with the interstellar medium the presence of the resulting antimatter is detectable by the two gamma rays produced every time positrons annihilate with nearby matter the frequency and wavelength of the gamma rays indicate that each carries 511 kev of energy i e the rest mass of an electron multiplied by c 2 observations by the european space agency s integral satellite may explain the origin of a giant antimatter cloud surrounding the galactic center the observations show that the cloud is asymmetrical and matches the pattern of x ray binaries binary star systems containing black holes or neutron stars mostly on one side of the galactic center while the mechanism is not fully understood it is likely to involve the production of pairs as ordinary matter gains kinetic energy while falling into a stellar remnant 20 21 antimatter may exist in relatively large amounts in far away galaxies due to cosmic inflation in the primordial time of the universe antimatter galaxies if they exist are expected to have the same chemistry and absorption and emission spectra as normal matter galaxies and their astronomical objects would be observationally identical making them difficult to distinguish 22 nasa is trying to determine if such galaxies exist by looking for x ray and gamma ray signatures of annihilation events in colliding superclusters 23 in october 2017 scientists working on the base experiment at cern reported a measurement of the antiproton magnetic moment to a precision of 1.5 parts per billion 24 25 it is consistent with the most precise measurement of the proton magnetic moment also made by base in 2014 which supports the hypothesis of cpt symmetry it should be noted that this measurement represents the first time that a property of antimatter is known more precisely than the equivalent property in matter natural production edit main article positron emission positrons are produced naturally in decays of naturally occurring radioactive isotopes for example potassium 40 and in interactions of gamma quanta emitted by radioactive nuclei with matter antineutrinos are another kind of antiparticle created by natural radioactivity decay many different kinds of antiparticles are also produced by and contained in cosmic rays in january 2011 research by the american astronomical society discovered antimatter positrons originating above thunderstorm clouds positrons are produced in gamma ray flashes created by electrons accelerated by strong electric fields in the clouds 26 27 antiprotons have also been found to exist in the van allen belts around the earth by the pamela module 28 29 antiparticles are also produced in any environment with a sufficiently high temperature mean particle energy greater than the pair production threshold it is hypothesized that during the period of baryogenesis when the universe was extremely hot and dense matter and antimatter were continually produced and annihilated the presence of remaining matter and absence of detectable remaining antimatter 30 is called baryon asymmetry the exact mechanism which produced this asymmetry during baryogenesis remains an unsolved problem one of the necessary conditions for this asymmetry is the violation of cp symmetry which has been experimentally observed in the weak interaction recent observations indicate black holes and neutron stars produce vast amounts of positron electron plasma via the jets 31 32 33 observation in cosmic rays edit main article cosmic ray satellite experiments have found evidence of positrons and a few antiprotons in primary cosmic rays amounting to less than 1% of the particles in primary cosmic rays this antimatter cannot all have been created in the big bang but is instead attributed to have been produced by cyclic processes at high energies for instance electron positron pairs may be formed in pulsars as a magnetized neutron star rotation cycle shears electron positron pairs from the star surface therein the antimatter forms a wind which crashes upon the ejecta of the progenitor supernovae this weathering takes place as the cold magnetized relativistic wind launched by the star hits the non relativistically expanding ejecta a shock wave system forms in the impact the outer one propagates in the ejecta while a reverse shock propagates back towards the star 34 the former ejection of matter in the outer shock wave and the latter production of antimatter in the reverse shock wave are steps in a space weather cycle preliminary results from the presently operating alpha magnetic spectrometer ams 02 on board the international space station show that positrons in the cosmic rays arrive with no directionality and with energies that range from 10 gev to in september 2014 new results with almost twice as much data were presented in a talk at cern and published in physical review letters 35 36 a new measurement of positron fraction up to was reported showing that positron fraction peaks at a maximum of about 16% of total electron positron events around an energy of 275 32 gev at higher energies up to the ratio of positrons to electrons begins to fall again the absolute flux of positrons also begins to fall before but peaks at energies far higher than electron energies which peak about 10 gev 37 these results on interpretation have been suggested to be due to positron production in annihilation events of massive dark matter particles 38 cosmic ray antiprotons also have a much higher energy than their normal matter counterparts protons they arrive at earth with a characteristic energy maximum of indicating their production in a fundamentally different process from cosmic ray protons which on average have only one sixth of the energy 39 there is no evidence of complex antimatter atomic nuclei such as antihelium nuclei i e anti alpha particles in cosmic rays these are actively being searched for because the detection of natural antihelium implies the existence of large antimatter structures such as an antistar a prototype of the ams 02 designated ams 01 was flown into space aboard the space shuttle discovery on sts 91 in june 1998 by not detecting any antihelium at all the ams 01 established an upper limit of for the antihelium to helium flux ratio 40 artificial production edit positrons edit main article positron positrons were reported 41 in november 2008 to have been generated by lawrence livermore national laboratory in larger numbers than by any previous synthetic process a laser drove electrons through a gold nuclei which caused the incoming electrons to emit energy quanta that decayed into both matter and antimatter positrons were detected at a higher rate and in greater density than ever previously detected in a laboratory previous experiments made smaller quantities of positrons using lasers and paper thin targets however new simulations showed that short ultra intense lasers and millimeter thick gold are a far more effective source 42 antiprotons antineutrons and antinuclei edit main articles antiproton and antineutron the existence of the antiproton was experimentally confirmed in 1955 by university of california berkeley physicists emilio and owen chamberlain for which they were awarded the 1959 nobel prize in physics 43 an antiproton consists of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark u u d the properties of the antiproton that have been measured all match the corresponding properties of the proton with the exception of the antiproton having opposite electric charge and magnetic moment from the proton shortly afterwards in 1956 the antineutron was discovered in collisions at the bevatron lawrence berkeley national laboratory by bruce cork and colleagues 44 in addition to anti baryons anti nuclei consisting of multiple bound antiprotons and antineutrons have been created these are typically produced at energies far too high to form antimatter atoms with bound positrons in place of electrons in 1965 a group of researchers led by antonino zichichi reported production of nuclei of antideuterium at the proton synchrotron at cern 45 at roughly the same time observations of antideuterium nuclei were reported by a group of american physicists at the alternating gradient synchrotron at brookhaven national laboratory 46 antihydrogen atoms edit main article antihydrogen in 1995 cern announced that it had successfully brought into existence nine hot antihydrogen atoms by implementing the slac fermilab concept during the ps210 experiment the experiment was performed using the low energy antiproton ring lear and was led by walter oelert and mario macri 47 fermilab soon confirmed the cern findings by producing approximately 100 antihydrogen atoms at their facilities the antihydrogen atoms created during ps210 and subsequent experiments at both cern and fermilab were extremely energetic and were not well suited to study to resolve this hurdle and to gain a better understanding of antihydrogen two collaborations were formed in the late 1990s namely athena and atrap in 1999 cern activated the antiproton decelerator a device capable of decelerating antiprotons from 3500 mev to still too hot to produce study effective antihydrogen but a huge leap forward in late 2002 the athena project announced that they had created the first cold antihydrogen 48 the atrap project released similar results very shortly thereafter 49 the antiprotons used in these experiments were cooled by decelerating them with the antiproton decelerator passing them through a thin sheet of foil and finally capturing them in a trap 50 the overall cooling process is workable but highly inefficient approximately 25 million antiprotons leave the antiproton decelerator and roughly 25,000 make it to the trap which is about 1 1000 or 0.1% of the original amount the antiprotons are still hot when initially trapped to cool them further they are mixed into an electron plasma the electrons in this plasma cool via cyclotron radiation and then sympathetically cool the antiprotons via coulomb collisions eventually the electrons are removed by the application of short duration electric fields leaving the antiprotons with energies less than 100 mev 51 while the antiprotons are being cooled in the first trap a small cloud of positrons is captured from radioactive sodium in a surko style positron accumulator 52 this cloud is then recaptured in a second trap near the antiprotons manipulations of the trap electrodes then tip the antiprotons into the positron plasma where some combine with antiprotons to form antihydrogen this neutral antihydrogen is unaffected by the electric and magnetic fields used to trap the charged positrons and antiprotons and within a few microseconds the antihydrogen hits the trap walls where it annihilates some hundreds of millions of antihydrogen atoms have been made in this fashion in 2005 athena disbanded and some of the former members along with others formed the alpha collaboration which is also based at cern the primary goal of these collaborations is the creation of less energetic cold antihydrogen better suited to study citation needed in 2016 a new antiproton decelerator and cooler called elena e low energy antiproton decelerator was built it takes the antiprotons from the antiproton decelerator and cools them to which is cold enough to study more than a hundred antiprotons can be captured per second a huge improvement but it would still take several thousand years to make a nanogram of antimatter most of the sought after high precision tests of the properties of antihydrogen could only be performed if the antihydrogen were trapped that is held in place for a relatively long time while antihydrogen atoms are electrically neutral the spins of their component particles produce a magnetic moment these magnetic moments can interact with an inhomogeneous magnetic field some of the antihydrogen atoms can be attracted to a magnetic minimum such a minimum can be created by a combination of mirror and multipole fields 53 antihydrogen can be trapped in such a magnetic minimum minimum b trap in november 2010 the alpha collaboration announced that they had so trapped 38 antihydrogen atoms for about a sixth of a second 54 55 this was the first time that neutral antimatter had been trapped on 26 april 2011 alpha announced that they had trapped 309 antihydrogen atoms some for as long as 1,000 seconds about 17 minutes this was longer than neutral antimatter had ever been trapped before 56 alpha has used these trapped atoms to initiate research into the spectral properties of the antihydrogen 57 the biggest limiting factor in the large scale production of antimatter is the availability of antiprotons recent data released by cern states that when fully operational their facilities are capable of producing ten million antiprotons per minute 58 assuming a 100% conversion of antiprotons to antihydrogen it would take 100 billion years to produce or 1 mole of antihydrogen approximately 6.02 10 23 atoms of anti hydrogen antihelium edit antihelium 3 nuclei 3 he were first observed in the 1970s in collision experiments at the institute for high energy physics by y group protvino near moscow ussr 59 and later created in collision experiments 60 collisions produce antinuclei through the coalescense of antiprotons and antineutrons created in these reactions in 2011 the star detector reported the observation of artificially created antihelium 4 nuclei anti alpha particles 4 he from such collisions 61 preservation edit antimatter cannot be stored in a container made of ordinary matter because antimatter reacts with any matter it touches annihilating itself and an equal amount of the container antimatter in the form of charged particles can be contained by a combination of electric and magnetic fields in a device called a penning trap this device cannot however contain antimatter that consists of uncharged particles for which atomic traps are used in particular such a trap may use the dipole moment electric or magnetic of the trapped particles at high vacuum the matter or antimatter particles can be trapped and cooled with slightly off resonant laser radiation using a magneto optical trap or magnetic trap small particles can also be suspended with optical tweezers using a highly focused laser beam 62 in 2011 cern scientists were able to preserve antihydrogen for approximately 17 minutes 63 cost edit scientists claim that antimatter is the costliest material to make 64 in 2006 gerald smith estimated $250 million could produce 10 milligrams of positrons 65 equivalent to $25 billion per gram in 1999 nasa gave a figure of $62.5 trillion per gram of antihydrogen 64 this is because production is difficult only very few antiprotons are produced in reactions in particle accelerators and because there is higher demand for other uses of particle accelerators according to cern it has cost a few hundred million swiss francs to produce about 1 billionth of a gram the amount used so far for particle antiparticle collisions 66 in comparison to produce the first atomic weapon the cost of the manhattan project was estimated at $23 billion with inflation during 2007 67 several studies funded by the nasa institute for advanced concepts are exploring whether it might be possible to use magnetic scoops to collect the antimatter that occurs naturally in the van allen belt of the earth and ultimately the belts of gas giants like jupiter hopefully at a lower cost per gram 68 uses edit medical edit reactions have practical applications in medical imaging such as positron emission tomography pet in positive beta decay a nuclide loses surplus positive charge by emitting a positron in the same event a proton becomes a neutron and a neutrino is also emitted nuclides with surplus positive charge are easily made in a cyclotron and are widely generated for medical use antiprotons have also been shown within laboratory experiments to have the potential to treat certain cancers in a similar method currently used for ion proton therapy 69 fuel edit isolated and stored anti matter could be used as a fuel for interplanetary or interstellar travel 70 as part of an antimatter catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion or other antimatter rocketry such as the redshift rocket since the energy density of antimatter is higher than that of conventional fuels an antimatter fueled spacecraft would have a higher thrust to weight ratio than a conventional spacecraft if collisions resulted only in photon emission the entire rest mass of the particles would be converted to kinetic energy the energy per unit mass 9 10 16 j kg is about 10 orders of magnitude greater than chemical energies 71 and about 3 orders of magnitude greater than the nuclear potential energy that can be liberated today using nuclear fission about per fission reaction 72 or 8 10 13 j kg and about 2 orders of magnitude greater than the best possible results expected from fusion about 6.3 10 14 j kg for the chain the reaction of 1 kg of antimatter with of matter would produce 1.8 10 17 j 180 petajoules of energy by the equivalence formula e mc 2 or the rough equivalent of 43 megatons of tnt slightly less than the yield of the tsar bomba the largest thermonuclear weapon ever detonated not all of that energy can be utilized by any realistic propulsion technology because of the nature of the annihilation products while reactions result in gamma ray photons these are difficult to direct and use for thrust in reactions between protons and antiprotons their energy is converted largely into relativistic neutral and charged pions the neutral pions decay almost immediately with a lifetime of 85 attoseconds into high energy photons but the charged pions decay more slowly with a lifetime of 26 nanoseconds and can be deflected magnetically to produce thrust charged pions ultimately decay into a combination of neutrinos carrying about 22% of the energy of the charged pions and unstable charged muons carrying about 78% of the charged pion energy with the muons then decaying into a combination of electrons positrons and neutrinos cf muon decay the neutrinos from this decay carry about 2/3 of the energy of the muons meaning that from the original charged pions the total fraction of their energy converted to neutrinos by one route or another would be about 0.22 0.74 73 weapons edit main article antimatter weapon antimatter has been considered as a trigger mechanism for nuclear weapons 74 a major obstacle is the difficulty of producing antimatter in large enough quantities and there is no evidence that it will ever be feasible 75 however the u s air force funded studies of the physics of antimatter in the cold war and began considering its possible use in weapons not just as a trigger but as the explosive itself 76 see also edit antimatter comet ambiplasma gravitational interaction of antimatter references edit smidgen
