joan was a powerful hurricane that caused death and destruction in over a dozen countries in the caribbean and central america moving on a due west course for nearly two weeks in october 1988 hurricane joan caused widespread flooding and over 200 deaths after moving into central america widespread suffering and economic crises were exacerbated by joan primarily across nicaragua as heavy rains and high winds impacted those near the path after crossing central america into the pacific the cyclone was renamed tropical storm miriam with the dissipation occurring southwest of mexico was

track and intensity of the storm according to the scale one of the latest cape verde type hurricanes to form in any season 4 joan formed from an area of convection in the intertropical convergence zone that moved off the coast of africa early in october it developed banding and was upgraded to tropical depression seventeen on october 10 and later designated as tropical storm joan while located at low latitude in the central atlantic ocean 5 hurricane joan on october 19 joan gradually strengthened as it passed over the southern windward islands on october 15 it continued heading west in response to a strong ridge and passed over the guajira peninsula on october 17 5 after entering the extreme southwestern caribbean sea joan strengthened into a hurricane it then slowly executed a small counterclockwise loop possibly in response to the nearby tropical depression eighteen 2 upwelling caused by the quasi stationary hurricane weakened the system as the nearby depression dissipated joan resumed its westward track a strong anticyclone over the southwestern caribbean sea created an extremely favorable environment and joan underwent rapid deepening at a rate of in the space of a day 4 with a minimum pressure of joan was one of the strongest october hurricanes since 1961 4 at the time it was located at the southernmost category 4 hurricane ever recorded at the time 5 that record has since been broken by hurricane ivan 2 6 7 joan made landfall just south of bluefields on october 22 7 it passed over the northern portion of lake nicaragua passed over managua and entered the pacific ocean near leon on october 23 2 joan remained a hurricane or tropical storm during its entire passage over central america and was a minimal tropical storm when it reached the pacific 2 as per the policy at the time joan was renamed miriam 2 tropical storm miriam hugged the coast of central america and reached its peak of on october 24 8 ordinarily a pressure this low would indicate a hurricane but due to its disorganized convection miriam was not upgraded to a hurricane 8 land interaction and wind shear weakened miriam to a tropical depression on october 26 low level winds carried the system out to sea and its convection dissipated on october 28 8 remnants continued out to sea and they regenerated on october 30 the tropical depression hung on for the next few days until its second and final dissipation on november 2 9 unusual path edit hurricane path through the southern caribbean in late october was highly unusual most october storms in the atlantic gravitate towards the northern portion of the caribbean and often recurve quickly 10 joan took the southernmost path of a tropical cyclone since a june system in 1933 although hurricane irene in 1971 took a path that was just north of 5 joan miriam was also unusual in that it survived passage from the atlantic to pacific ocean only seven other storms have been known to survive the passage between the atlantic and pacific oceans 11 preparations edit tropical storm miriam on october 23 tropical storm watches and later warnings were issued for the windward islands as far north as martinique on october 13 they were dropped over the subsequent two days as joan passed through along the coast of south america additional warnings were raised and later dropped as joan paralleled the coast 12 the first hurricane watches were issued for parts of panama and providencia starting on october 18 the watch area was expanded to include costa rica and nicaragua on october 19 as the watches were upgraded to warnings these warnings provided several hours worth of lead time allowing evacuations and preparations to be made 13 in addition flash flood and mudslide warnings were issued for western panama costa rica honduras and nicaragua starting on october 21 in response to miriam the flood and mudslide warnings issued because of joan were not lifted until october 23 and 25 tropical storm warnings were issued for the pacific coast of nicaragua el salvador and the gulf of fonseca on october 24 they were dropped the next day guatemala was placed under a warning on october 24 in addition new flash flood and mudslide warnings were raised for guatemala and the mexican state of chiapas on october 24 and 25 respectively all warnings and watches were discontinued later on october 25 as miriam turned away from the coast 14 despite the dangers from the intense hurricane evacuations in bluefields were met with resistance and disbelief from residents 3 in managua 70,000 people were evacuated to safe areas 2 in the remaining areas of nicaragua 300,000 people were evacuated 15 in costa rica a total of 55,000 people were evacuated 16 impact edit impact by country country deaths damage nicaragua 148-248 costa

acres of canopy 24 hurricane joan caused transportation difficulties in the country floodwaters destroyed and seriously damaged roads totaling 404 miles in length were washed away 2 in an unfortunate coincidence hurricane joan hit shortly after an armed conflict in the region had started to cool off the hurricane destroyed much of the infrastructure in nicaragua contributing to a recession that was already underway the losses to cash crops severely reduced exports to under dollars 22 these factors combined to aggravate a recession and deepen the economic crisis government spending to rebuild infrastructure negated recently introduced anti inflation measures hurricane joan was a partial cause of nicaraguans being on average worse off than they were in the 1970s 25 in all the storm left at

mexico collectively contributed around of food and medicine the canadian swedish west german spanish and dutch governments contributed aid amounting to dollars 1988 each no aid was sent by the united states government the soviet union contributed an unknown sum 22 the slow response to requests for aid was contributed to by the sandinista actions which was viewed by a few anonymous diplomats from other countries who commented to the press as undermining the peace process championed by arias 22 those actions were the july 10 arrests of opposition activists and the closing down of independent radio stations 22 in addition the government also barred foreign humanitarian groups from receiving american aid as well as turning back a relief shipment days before the storm 22 on october 28 1988
