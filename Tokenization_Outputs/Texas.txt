the deep south to far west texas which is generally acknowledged to be part of the interior southwest 23 geology main article geology of texas palo duro canyon franklin mountains state park big bend national park texas is the southernmost part of the great plains which ends in the south against the folded sierra madre occidental of mexico the continental crust forms a stable mesoproterozoic craton which changes across a broad continental margin and transitional crust into true oceanic crust of the gulf of mexico the oldest rocks in texas date from the mesoproterozoic and are about 1,600 million years old these precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks underlie most of the state and are exposed in three places llano uplift van horn and the franklin mountains near el paso sedimentary rocks overlay most of these ancient rocks the oldest sediments were deposited on the flanks of a rifted continental margin or passive margin that developed during cambrian time this margin existed until laurasia and gondwana collided in the pennsylvanian subperiod to form pangea this is the buried crest of the appalachian mountains ouachita mountains zone of pennsylvanian continental collision this orogenic crest is today buried beneath the waco antonio trend the late paleozoic mountains collapsed as rifting in the jurassic period began to open the gulf of mexico pangea began to break up in the triassic but seafloor spreading to form the gulf of mexico occurred only in the mid and late jurassic the shoreline shifted again to the eastern margin of the state and the gulf of mexico passive margin began to form today 9 to 12 miles 14 to of sediments are buried beneath the texas continental shelf and a large proportion of remaining us oil reserves are located here at the start of its formation the incipient gulf of mexico basin was restricted and seawater often evaporated completely to form thick evaporite deposits of jurassic age these salt deposits formed salt dome diapirs and are found in east texas along the gulf coast 24 east texas outcrops consist of cretaceous and paleogene sediments which contain important deposits of eocene lignite the mississippian and pennsylvanian sediments in the north permian sediments in the west and cretaceous sediments in the east along the gulf coast and out on the texas continental shelf contain oil oligocene volcanic rocks are found in

mississippian culture also known as mound builders which extended along the mississippi river valley east of texas and the civilizations of mesoamerica centered south of texas influence of teotihuacan in northern mexico peaked around ad 500 and declined over the 8th to 10th centuries no culture was dominant in the present day texas region and many peoples inhabited the area 43 native american tribes that lived inside the boundaries of present day texas include the alabama apache atakapan bidai caddo coahuiltecan comanche choctaw coushatta hasinai jumano karankawa kickapoo kiowa tonkawa and wichita 44 45 the name texas derives from a word in the caddoan language of the hasinai which means friends or allies 2 16 46 47 48 whether a native american tribe was friendly or warlike was critical to the fates of european explorers and settlers in that land 49 friendly tribes taught newcomers how to grow indigenous crops prepare foods and hunt wild game warlike tribes made life difficult and dangerous for europeans through their attacks and resistance to the newcomers 50 colonization main articles french colonization of texas spanish texas and mexican texas flags of the six nations that have had sovereignty over some or all of the current territory of texas the first historical document related to texas was a map of the gulf coast created in 1519 by spanish explorer alonso de pineda 51 52 nine years later shipwrecked spanish explorer cabeza de vaca and his cohort became the first europeans in what is now texas 53 54 cabeza de vaca reported that in 1528 when the spanish landed in the area half the natives died from a disease of the bowels and blamed us 55 cabeza de vaca also made observations about the way of life of the ignaces natives of texas they went about with a firebrand setting fire to the plains and timber so as to drive off the mosquitos and also to get lizards and similar things which they eat to come out of the soil in the same manner they kill deer encircling them with fires and they do it also to deprive the animals of pasture compelling them to go for food where the indians want 56 francisco de coronado describes his 1541 encounter with two kinds of people travel around these plains with the cows one is called querechos and the others teyas they are very well built and painted and are enemies of each other they have no other settlement or location than comes from traveling around with the cows they kill all of these they wish and tan the hides with which they clothe themselves and make their tents and they eat the flesh sometimes even raw and they also even drink the blood when thirsty the tents they make are like field tents and they set them up over some poles they have made for this purpose which come together and are tied at the top and when they go from one place to another they carry them on some dogs they have of which they have many and they load them with the tents and poles and other things for the country is so level as i said that they can make use of these because they carry the poles dragging along on the ground the sun is what they worship most 57 european powers ignored the area until accidentally settling there in 1685 miscalculations by cavelier de la salle resulted in his establishing the colony of fort saint louis at matagorda bay rather than along the mississippi river 58 the colony lasted

antonio as the first spanish civilian settlement in the area 64 nicolas de la 1771 map of the northern frontier of new spain clearly shows the provincia de los tejas 65 hostile native tribes and distance from nearby spanish colonies discouraged settlers from moving to the area it was one of new least populated provinces 66 in 1749 the spanish peace treaty with the lipan apache 67 angered many tribes including the comanche tonkawa and hasinai 68 the comanche signed a treaty with spain in 1785 69 and later helped to defeat the lipan apache and karankawa tribes 70 71 with more numerous missions being established priests led a peaceful conversion of most tribes by the end of the 18th century only a few nomadic tribes had not converted to christianity 72 stephen f austin was the first american empresario given permission to operate a colony within mexican texas mexico in 1824 coahuila y tejas is the northeastern most state when the united states purchased louisiana from france in 1803 american authorities insisted that the agreement also included texas the boundary between new spain and the united states was finally set at the sabine river in 1819 at what is now the border between texas and louisiana 73 eager for new land many united states settlers refused to recognize the agreement several filibusters raised armies to invade the area west of the sabine river 74 in 1821 the mexican war of independence included the texas territory which became part of mexico 75 due to its low population mexico made the area part of the state of coahuila y tejas 76 hoping that more settlers would reduce the near constant comanche raids mexican texas liberalized its immigration policies to permit immigrants from outside mexico and spain 77 under the mexican immigration system large swathes of land were allotted to empresarios who recruited settlers from the united states europe and the mexican interior the first grant to moses austin was passed to his son stephen f austin after his death settlers the old three hundred made places along the brazos river in 1822 78 twenty three other empresarios brought settlers to the state the majority of whom were from the united states 78 79 the population of texas grew rapidly in 1825 texas had about 3,500 people with most of mexican descent 80 by 1834 the population had grown to about 37,800 people with only 7,800 of mexican descent 81 most of these early settlers who arrived with austin and soon after were persons less than fortunate in life as texas was devoid of the comforts found elsewhere in mexico and the united states during that time period early texas settler david b edwards described his fellow texans as being banished from the pleasures of life 82 many immigrants openly flouted mexican law especially the prohibition against slavery combined with united states attempts to purchase texas mexican authorities decided in 1830 to prohibit continued immigration from the united states 83 new laws also called for the enforcement of customs duties angering both native mexican citizens tejanos and recent immigrants 84 the anahuac disturbances in 1832 were the first open revolt against mexican rule and they coincided with a revolt in mexico against the president 85 texians sided with the federalists against the current government and drove all mexican soldiers out of east texas 86 they took advantage of the lack of oversight to agitate for more political freedom texians met at the convention of 1832 to discuss requesting independent statehood among other issues 87 the following year texians reiterated their demands at the convention of 1833 republic main articles texas revolution and republic of texas within mexico tensions continued between federalists and centralists in early 1835 wary texians formed committees of correspondence and safety 88 the unrest erupted into armed conflict in late 1835 at the battle of gonzales 89 this launched the texas revolution and over the next two months the texians defeated all mexican troops in the region 90 texians elected delegates to the consultation which created a provisional government 91 the provisional government soon collapsed from infighting and texas was without clear governance for the first two months of 1836 92 93 william henry huddle surrender of santa anna 1886 texas state capitol austin during this time of political turmoil mexican president antonio de santa anna personally led an army to end the revolt 94 the mexican expedition was initially successful general de urrea defeated all the texian resistance along the coast culminating in the goliad massacre 95 santa forces after a thirteen day siege overwhelmed texian defenders at the battle of the alamo news of the defeats sparked panic amongst texas settlers 96 the present day outlines of the u s states superimposed on the boundaries of the republic of texas the newly elected texian delegates to the convention of 1836 quickly signed a declaration of independence on march 2 forming the republic of texas after electing interim officers the convention disbanded 97 the new government joined the other settlers in texas in the runaway scrape fleeing from the approaching mexican army 96 after several weeks of retreat the texian army commanded by sam houston attacked and defeated santa forces at the battle of san jacinto 98 santa anna was captured and forced to sign the treaties of velasco ending the war 99 while texas had won its independence political battles raged between two factions of the new republic the nationalist faction led by mirabeau b lamar advocated the continued independence of texas the expulsion of the native americans and the expansion of the republic to the pacific ocean their opponents led by sam houston advocated the annexation of texas to the united states and peaceful co existence with native americans the conflict between the factions was typified by an incident known as the texas archive war 100 mexico launched two small expeditions into texas in 1842 the town of san antonio was captured twice and texans were defeated in battle in the dawson massacre despite these successes mexico did not keep an occupying force in texas and the republic survived 101 the inability to defend itself added momentum to eventual annexation into the united states statehood main articles texas annexation and war as early as 1837 the republic made several attempts to negotiate annexation with the united states 102 opposition within the republic from the nationalist faction along with strong abolitionist opposition within the united states slowed admission into the union texas was finally annexed when the expansionist james k polk won the election of 1844 103 on december 29 1845 congress admitted texas to the u s as a constituent state of the union 104 the population of the new state was quite small at first and there was a strong mix between the english speaking american settlers that dominated in the eastern northeastern portions of the state and the spanish speaking former mexicans that dominated in the southern and western portions of the state statehood brought many new settlers because of the long spanish presence in mexico and various failed colonization efforts by the spanish and mexicans in northern mexico there were large herds of longhorn cattle that roamed the state hardy by nature but also suitable for slaughtering and consumption they represented an economic opportunity that many entrepreneurs seized upon thus creating the cowboy culture for which texas is famous while in the early days of the republic cattle and bison were slaughtered for their hides soon a beef industry was established with cattle being shipped all over the u s and the caribbean within a few decades beef had become a staple of the american diet after annexation mexico broke diplomatic relations with the united states while the united states claimed that border stretched to the rio grande mexico claimed it was the nueces river while the former republic of texas could not enforce its border claims the united states had the military strength and the political will to do so president polk ordered general zachary taylor south to the rio grande on january 13 1846 a few months later mexican troops routed an american cavalry patrol in the disputed area in the thornton affair starting the war the first battles of the war were fought in texas the siege of fort texas battle of palo alto and battle of resaca de la palma after these decisive victories the united states invaded mexican territory ending the fighting in texas 105 proposals of 1850 for texas northwestern boundary after a series of united states victories the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo ended the two year war in return for us 18 250 000 mexico gave the u s undisputed control of texas ceded the mexican cession in 1848 most of which today is called the american southwest and borders were established at the rio grande 105 the compromise of 1850 set boundaries at their present form u s senator james pearce of maryland drafted the final proposal 18 where texas ceded its claims to land which later became half of present day new mexico a third of colorado and small portions of kansas oklahoma and wyoming to the federal government in return for the assumption of $10 million of the old debt 18 post war texas grew rapidly as migrants poured into the cotton lands of the state 106 they also brought or purchased enslaved african americans whose numbers tripled in the state from 1850 to 1860 from 58,000 to 182,566 107 civil war and reconstruction main article texas in the american civil war civil war monument in galveston texas texas was at war again after the election of 1860 at this time blacks comprised 30 percent of the population and they were overwhelmingly enslaved 108 when abraham lincoln was elected south carolina seceded from the union five other lower south states quickly followed a state convention considering secession opened in austin on january 28 1861 on february 1 by a vote of the convention adopted an ordinance of secession from the united states texas voters approved this ordinance on february 23 1861 texas joined the newly created confederate states of america on march 4 1861 ratifying the permanent c s constitution on march 23 2 109 not all texans favored secession initially although many of the same would later support the southern cause most notable unionist was the state governor sam houston not wanting to aggravate the situation houston refused two offers from president lincoln for union troops to keep him in office after refusing to swear an oath of allegiance to the confederacy houston was deposed as governor 110 while far from the major battlefields of the american civil war texas contributed large numbers of men and equipment to the rest of the confederacy 111 union troops briefly occupied the primary port galveston border with mexico was known as the backdoor of the confederacy because trade occurred at the border bypassing the union blockade 112 the confederacy repulsed all union attempts to shut down this route 111 but role as a supply state was marginalized in mid 1863 after the union capture of the mississippi river the final battle of the civil war was fought near brownsville texas at palmito ranch 113 with a confederate victory texas descended into anarchy for two months between the surrender of the army of northern virginia and the assumption of authority by union general gordon granger violence marked the early months of reconstruction 111 juneteenth commemorates the announcement of the emancipation proclamation in galveston by general gordon granger almost two and a half years after the original announcement 114 115 president johnson in 1866 declared the civilian government restored in texas 116 despite not meeting reconstruction requirements congress resumed allowing elected texas representatives into the federal government in 1870 social volatility continued as the state struggled with agricultural depression and labor issues 117 like most of the south the texas economy was devastated by the war however since the state had not been as dependent on slaves as other parts of the south it was able to recover more quickly the culture in texas during the later 19th century exhibited many facets of a frontier territory the state became notorious as a haven for people from other parts of the country who wanted to escape debt criminal prosecution or other problems indeed gone to texas was a common expression for those fleeing the law in other states nevertheless the state also attracted many businessmen and other settlers with more legitimate interests as well the cattle industry continued to thrive though it gradually became less profitable cotton and lumber became major industries creating new economic booms in various regions of the state railroad networks grew rapidly as did the port at galveston as commerce between texas and the rest of the u s and the rest of the world expanded as with some other states before the lumber industry quickly decimated the forests of texas such that by the early 20th century the major of the forest population in texas was gone later conservation efforts restored some of it but never to the level it once was earlier 20th century spindletop the first major oil gusher in 1900 texas suffered the deadliest natural disaster in u s history during the galveston hurricane 38 on january 10 1901 the first major oil well in texas spindletop was found south of beaumont other fields were later discovered nearby in east texas west texas and under the gulf of mexico the resulting oil boom transformed texas 118 oil production eventually averaged three million barrels per day at its peak in 1972 119 in 1901 the democratic dominated state legislature passed a bill requiring payment of a poll tax for voting which effectively disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites and latinos in addition the legislature established white primaries ensuring that minorities were excluded from the formal political process the number of voters dropped dramatically and the democrats crushed competition from the republican and populist parties 120 121 the socialist party became the second largest party in texas after 1912 122 coinciding with a large socialist upsurge in the united states during fierce battles in the labor movement and the popularity of national heroes like eugene v debs the socialists popularity soon waned after their vilification by the united states government for their opposition to us involvement in world war i the great depression and the dust bowl dealt a double blow to the economy which had significantly improved since the civil war migrants abandoned the worst hit sections of texas during the dust bowl years especially from this period on blacks left texas in the great migration to get work in the northern united states or california and to escape the oppression of segregation 123 in 1940 texas was 74 percent anglo 14.4 percent black and 11.5 percent hispanic 124 world war ii had a dramatic impact on texas as federal money poured in to build military bases munitions factories pow detention camps and army hospitals 750,000 young men left for service the cities exploded with new industry

states in the 1870s white democrats wrested power back in the state legislature from the biracial coalition at the end of reconstruction in the early 20th century the legislature passed bills to impose poll taxes followed by white primaries these measures effectively disfranchised most blacks poor whites and mexican americans 120 121 in the 1890s 100,000 blacks voted in the state by 1906 only 5,000 could vote 138 as a result the democratic party dominated texas politics from the turn of the century imposing racial segregation and white supremacy it held power until after passage in the mid 1960s of national civil rights legislation enforcing constitutional rights of all citizens although texas was essentially a one party state during this time and the democratic primary was viewed as the real election the democratic party had conservative and liberal factions which became more pronounced after the new deal 139 additionally several factions of the party briefly split during the 1930s and 1940s 139 the conservative white voters began to support republican presidential candidates by the mid 20th century after this period they supported republicans for local and state offices as well and most whites became republican party members 140 the party also attracted some minorities but many have continued to vote for democratic candidates the shift to the republican party is much attributed to the fact that the democratic party became increasingly liberal during the 20th century and thus increasingly out of touch with the average texas voter 141 as texas was always a conservative state voters switched to the gop which now more closely reflected their beliefs 141 142 commentators have also attributed the shift to republican political consultant karl rove who managed numerous political campaigns in texas in the 1980s and 1990s 142 other stated reasons included court ordered redistricting and the demographic shift in relation to the sun belt that favored the republican party and conservatism 130 the 2003 texas redistricting of congressional districts led by republican tom delay was called by the new york times an extreme case of partisan gerrymandering 143 a group of democratic legislators the texas eleven fled the state in a quorum busting effort to prevent the legislature from acting but was unsuccessful 144 the state had already redistricted following the 2000 census despite these efforts the legislature passed a map heavily in favor of republicans based on 2000 data and ignoring the estimated nearly one million new residents in the state since that date career attorneys and analysts at the department of justice objected to the plan as diluting the votes of african american and hispanic voters but political appointees overrode them and approved it 143 legal challenges to the redistricting reached the national supreme court in the case league of united latin american citizens v perry 2006 but the court ruled in favor of the state and republicans 145 in the 2014 texas elections the tea party movement made large gains with numerous tea party favorites being elected into office including dan patrick as lieutenant governor 146 147 ken paxton as attorney general 146 148 in addition to numerous other candidates 148 including conservative republican greg abbott as governor 149 texas politics today texas voters lean toward fiscal conservatism while enjoying the benefits of huge federal investment in the state in military and other facilities achieved by the power of the solid south in the 20th century they also tend to have socially conservative values 150 151 since 1980 most texas voters have supported republican presidential candidates in 2000 and 2004 republican george w bush won texas with 60.1 percent of the vote partly due to his favorite son status as a former governor of the state john mccain won the state in 2008 but with a smaller margin of victory compared to bush at 55 percent of the vote austin dallas houston and san antonio consistently lean democratic in both local and statewide elections residents of counties along the rio grande closer to the mexico united states border where
