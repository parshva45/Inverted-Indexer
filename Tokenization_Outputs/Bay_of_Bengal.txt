organization defines the limits of the bay of bengal as follows 3 on the east a line running from cape negrais in burma through the larger islands of the andaman group in such a way that all the narrow waters between the islands lie to the eastward of the line and are excluded from the bay of bengal as far as a point in little andaman island in latitude longitude and thence along the southwest limit of the burma sea a line running from oedjong raja 5.533 95.200 in sumatra to poeloe bras and on through the western islands of the nicobar group to sandy point in little andaman island in such a way that all the narrow waters appertain to the burma sea on the south ram sethu between india and ceylon sri lanka and from the southern extreme of dondra head south point of ceylon to the north point of poeloe bras 5.733 95.067 etymology edit the bay gets its name from the historical bengal region the indian state of west bengal and modern day bangladesh in ancient scriptures this water body may have been referred to as mahodadhi sanskrit lit great water receptacle 4 5 while it appears as sinus gangeticus or gangeticus sinus meaning gulf of the ganges in ancient maps 6 the other sanskrit names for bay of bengal are vangopasagara sanskrit lit bay also simply called as vangasagara sanskrit lit bengal sea and purvapayodhi sanskrit lit eastern ocean even today in bengali it is known as bongoposagor rivers edit many major rivers of india flow west to east before draining into the bay of bengal the ganga is the northernmost of these its main channel enters and flows through bangladesh where it is known as the padma river before joining the meghna river however the brahmaputra river flows from east to west in assam before turning south and entering bangladesh where it is called the jamuna river this joins the padma where upon the padma joins the meghna river that finally drains into bay of bengal the sundarbans mangrove of forest of bangladesh is a forest at the delta of the padma jamuna and meghna rivers lies partly in west bengal and mostly in bangladesh the brahmaputra at is the 28th longest river in the world it originates in tibet the hooghly river another channel of the ganga that flows through calcutta drains into bay of bengal the rivers deposit nearly 1000 million tons of sediment per year the sediment from these three rivers form the bengal delta and the submarine fan a vast structure that extends from bangladesh to south of the equator is up to 16.5 kilometres thick and contains at least 1,130 trillion tonnes of sediment which has accumulated over the last 17 million years at an average rate of 665 million tons per annum 7 the bay of bengal used to be deeper than the mariana trench the present deepest ocean point citation needed the fan has buried organic carbon at a rate of nearly 1.1 trillion mol yr 13.2 million t yr since the early miocene period the three rivers currently contribute nearly 8% of the total organic carbon toc deposited in the oceans due to high toc accumulation in the deep sea bed of the bay of bengal the area is rich in oil and natural gas and gas hydrate reserves bangladesh can reclaim land substantially and economically gain from the sea area by constructing sea dikes bunds causeways and by trapping the sediment from its rivers further southwest of bangladesh the mahanadi godavari krishna and kaveri rivers also flow from west to east in south asia and drain into the bay of bengal many small rivers also drain directly into the bay of bengal the shortest of them is the cooum

nicobar islands and the andaman islands are part of the burma microplate the india plate subducts beneath the burma plate at the sunda trench or java trench here the pressure of the two plates on each other increase pressure and temperature resulting in the formation of volcanoes such as the volcanoes in myanmar and a volcanic arc called the sunda arc the sumatra andaman earthquake and asian tsunami was a result of the pressure at this zone causing a submarine earthquake which then resulted in a destructive tsunami 11 marine geology edit a zone 50 m wide extending from the island of ceylon and the coromandel coast to the head of the bay and thence southwards through a strip embracing the andaman and nicobar islands is bounded by the 100 fathom line of sea bottom some 50 m beyond

india and bangladesh have forged naval cooperation agreements with malaysia thailand and indonesia to increase cooperation in checking terrorism in the high seas 31 image of united states ships participating in the malabar 2007 naval exercise aegis cruisers from the navies of japan and australia and logistical support ships from singapore and india in the bay of bengal took part its outlying islands the andaman and nicobar islands and most importantly major ports such as kolkata chennai visakhapatnam tuticorin chittagong and mongla along its coast with the bay of bengal added to its importance 32 china has recently made efforts to project influence into the region through tie ups with myanmar and bangladesh 33 the united states has held major exercises with bangladesh malaysia

additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed december 2012 learn how and when to remove this template message a transboundary issue is defined as an environmental problem in which either the cause of the problem and or its impact is separated by a national boundary or the problem contributes to a global environmental problem and finding regional solutions is considered to be a global environmental benefit the eight bay of bengal countries have 2012 identified three major transboundary problems or areas of concern affecting the health of the bay that they can work on together with the support of the bay of bengal large marine ecosystem project boblme the eight countries are now 2012 developing responses to these issues and their causes for future implementation as the strategic action programme overexploitation of fisheries edit some small fishing boats are catching fish sell them in local coastal markets fisheries production in the bay of bengal is six million tonnes per year more than seven percent of the catch the major transboundary issues relating to shared fisheries are a decline in the overall availability of fish resources changes in species composition of catches the high proportion of juvenile fish in the catch and changes in marine biodiversity especially through loss of vulnerable and endangered species the transboundary nature of these issues are that many fish stocks are shared between boblme countries through the transboundary migration of fish or larvae fishing overlaps national jurisdictions both legally and overcapacity and overfishing in one location forces a migration of fishers and vessels to other locations all countries to a greater or lesser degree are experiencing difficulties in implementing fisheries management especially the ecosystem approach to fisheries bay of bengal countries contribute significantly to the global problem of loss of vulnerable and endangered species the main causes of the issues are open access to fishing grounds government emphasis on increasing fish catches inappropriate government subsidies provided to fishers increasing fishing effort especially from trawlers and purse seiners high consumer demand for fish including for seed and fishmeal for aquaculture ineffective fisheries management and illegal and destructive fishing degradation of critical habitats edit the bay of bengal is an area of high biodiversity with many endangered and vulnerable species the major transboundary issues relating to habitats are the loss and degradation of mangrove habitats degradation of coral reefs and the loss of and damage to seagrasses the transboundary nature of these major issues are that all three critical habitats occur in all boblme countries coastal development for several varying uses of the land and sea are common in all boblme countries trade in products from all the habitats is transboundary in nature climate change impacts are shared by all boblme countries the main causes of the issues are food security needs of the coastal poor lack of coastal development plans increasing trade in products from coastal habitats coastal development and industrialization ineffective marine protected areas and lack of enforcement upstream development that affects water flow intensive upstream agricultural practices and increasing tourism pollution and water quality edit the major transboundary issues relating to pollution and water quality are sewage borne pathogens and organic load solid waste marine litter increasing nutrient inputs oil pollution persistent organic pollutants pops and persistent toxic substances ptss sedimentation and heavy metals the transboundary nature of these issues are discharge of untreated partially treated sewage being a common problem sewage and organic discharges from the ganges brahmaputra meghna river are likely to be transboundary plastics and derelict fishing gear can be transported long distances across national boundaries high nutrient discharges from rivers could intensify largescale hypoxia atmospheric transport of nutrients is inherently transboundary differences between countries with regard to regulation and enforcement of shipping discharges may drive discharges across boundaries tar balls are transported long distances pops ptss and mercury including organo mercury undergo long range transport sedimentation and most heavy metal contamination tend to be localized and lack a strong transboundary dimension the main causes of the issues are increasing coastal population density and urbanization higher consumption resulting in more waste generated per person insufficient funds allocated to waste management migration of industry into boblme countries and proliferation of small industries history edit ross island in the andamans was one of the main naval bases of british india during world war ii northern circars occupied the western coast of the bay of bengal and is now considered to be madras state chola dynasty 9th century to 12th
