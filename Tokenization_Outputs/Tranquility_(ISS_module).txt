2010 nasa launched the module on the space shuttle s sts 130 mission the module provides six berthing locations but one of the locations is disabled as modules originally planned to be attached to tranquility were canceled sts 130 also brought the cupola a large window module and robotics work station to the iss which was then attached to the nadir side of tranquility the module also includes various iss systems including additional life support systems contents 1 design 2 purpose 3 connections to other station components 4 naming contest 5 image gallery 6 references 7 external links design edit interior of tranquility the tranquility node during pre processing tranquility was built within the esa nasa iss bartering system esa committed to build and fund both harmony and tranquility as well as the atv in order to use nasa iss facitilies fly astronauts on the shuttle and for other iss services esa teamed up with the italian space agency asi to build both harmony and tranquility at thales alenia space in turin tranquility provides six berthing locations with power data and commanding thermal and environmental control and crew access for more attached habitable volumes or for crew transportation vehicles or stowage or an appropriate combination of all of these one of the berthing locations is used by cupola which houses a robotic work station inside it to assist in the assembly maintenance of the iss and offers a window for earth observations tranquility was launched with the cupola attached to its port facing common berthing mechanism cbm after mating tranquility with the port cbm of unity the cupola was transferred to the nadir facing port of tranquility where it will stay the module has three redundant berthing ports that were not scheduled to be used prior to the end of the space shuttle program although there is a power data grapple fixture reserved for the special purpose dexterous manipulator dextre which is located on the zenith berthing location the current iss configuration requires tranquility to be docked to the port berthing location of unity as such the three unused berthing locations of tranquility were disabled as the close proximity to other segments would prohibit the direct use for cargo spacecraft or using the docking module pma 3 which was relocated from harmony to the port berthing location of tranquility for storage at the time the move of pma 3 to the port location of tranquility was required because nasa decided to leave the multi purpose logistics module mplm leonardo permanently attached to the iss which will be located at the nadir side of unity in 2001 nasa considered changing the design of the module this idea for an extended or stretched module 3 was a result of the deferral deletion of the habitation module the stretched module would have held 16 racks compared with the baseline capacity of eight racks this modification was not funded and the plans were abandoned purpose edit space toilet inside node 3 after relocation from the us lab the life support system recycles waste water for crew use and generates oxygen for the crew to breathe in addition tranquility contains an atmosphere revitalization system to remove contaminants from the atmosphere and monitor control the atmosphere constituents of the iss tranquility also contains a waste and hygiene compartment toilet for supporting the on board crew node 3 is primarily be used for exercise storage and robotics work in connection with cupola connections to other station components edit tranquility in the sspf tranquility was located in the clean room at the thales alenia space turin site until 2009 4 it was shipped to kennedy space center ksc on may 17 and arrived in florida on may 20 2009 it was

to accommodate the spacex dragon v2 and boeing cst 100 commercial crew manned transports expected to be operational by 2017 iss crews began work in march 2015 to configure the station as part of this work pressurized mating adapter 3 on the port side of tranquility will be moved to the zenith port of the harmony node 2 module above pressurized mating adapter 2 to serve as a backup docking port for these vehicles in addition on may 27 2015 the leonardo permanent multipurpose module was moved from the nadir of node 1 unity to the forward port side of tranquility to free up unity as a backup port for commercial resupply services cargo spacecraft from spacex and orbital sciences 8 9 in april 2016 as part of the cargo payload from spacex crs 8 tranquility has got the bigelow expandable activity module on its aft port for a two year duration the completed module was shown in a media event in las vegas on march 12 2015 as prepared to be shipped to nasa 10 port pma 3 2010-2017 starboard unity
