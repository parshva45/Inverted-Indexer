its path the tranquility module was moved to the port side of the unity node using the space robot arm before tranquility was installed the spacewalkers removed oru platform and secured it to one of the truss segments to function as a backup for a platform to be installed on sts 132 once the new module was in place the spacewalkers proceeded to connect temporary heater and data cables between unity and tranquility behnken and patrick were ahead of the timeline so they were also able to complete some get ahead tasks the spacewalk was completed six and a half hours later on friday 08 49 utc after the spacewalk other crew members completed transfer related tasks the transfers are now over halfway complete 13 february flight day 6 spacewalk 2 preparation edit on flight day 6 members of the

disconnect valve and floated towards nick patrick procedures called for a bake out while patrick worked during the sunlit portion of the orbit and a contamination test in the airlock the bake out happened at the end of the spacewalk while the spacewalk was happening terry virts and kay hire along with iss commander jeff williams soichi noguchi and t j creamer continued outfitting the tranquility module this included setting up the ventilation system connecting electrical and computer cables and configuring racks they confirmed lights and computers were on in the node once the ammonia cooling system had been activated the crew also received word the mission had been extended by one day in the morning 15 february flight day 8 edit cupola was moved by canadarm2 from the forward port to the nadir port of tranquility on flight day 8 the cupola was successfully moved from its launch location to its permanent location on the earth facing side of tranquility 26 cupola was moved by the space station robot arm ssrms which was operated by kay hire and terry virts iss commander jeff williams assisted them by releasing the bolts and hooks that held the cupola in place and then securing it to its new home the process was slightly delayed due to some bolts that were torqued tighter than expected on the ground but flight controllers were able to increase the torque to release the bolts once the move of the cupola was complete outfitting continued to get the cupola ready the crew will be able to ingress it tomorrow but the window covers will not be opened until after the third and final spacewalk while the cupola relocation was going on some of the crew members participated in transferring items between the shuttle and station also during this time bob behnken and nick patrick prepared the tools that they will use during the final spacewalk scheduled for flight day 10 during this time the pair re sized another spacesuit on station for use by behnken
