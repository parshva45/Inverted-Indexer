tropical cyclones in philippine history killing at least forming out of a tropical disturbance on 1991 several hundred kilometers north northeast of palau the depression that would become thelma tracked generally westward after turning southwestward in response to a cold front the system intensified into a tropical storm on as it approached the philippines hours before moving over the visayas thelma attained its peak intensity with estimated ten minute sustained winds of and a barometric pressure of 992 mbar hpa 29.29 inhg despite moving over land the system weakened only slightly emerging over the south china sea on while retaining gale force winds thelma ultimately succumbed to wind shear and degraded to a tropical depression on the depression made landfall in southern vietnam before dissipating hours later while passing over the philippines interaction with the high terrain of some of the islands resulted in torrential rainfall through a process known as orographic lift much of the visayas received of rain however on leyte island there was a localized downpour that brought totals to with the majority of this falling in a three hour span an unprecedented flash flood took place on the island much of the land had been deforestated or poorly cultivated and was unable to absorb most of the rain creating a large runoff this water overwhelmed the watershed and rushed downstream ormoc city located past where the anilao and malbasag rivers converge suffered the brunt of the flood in just three hours the city was devastated with thousands of homes damaged or destroyed a total of were killed in the city alone with along the riverbank outside of ormoc city were killed across leyte and negros occidental throughout the country at least lost their lives while another missing and presumed dead this made thelma the deadliest tropical cyclone in philippine history surpassing a storm in 1867 that killed 1,800 1 2 until later surpassed by typhoon haiyan yolanda in 2013 which killed at least 3 a total of were destroyed while another damaged total losses amounted to nb 1 initially it took over for word of the disaster to reach officials due to a crippled communication network around ormoc city within a few days emergency supply centers were established and aid from various agencies under the united nations and several countries flowed into the country a total of worth of grants and materials was provided collectively in the international relief effort contents 1 meteorological history 2 impact 2.1 ormoc city tragedy 3 aftermath 4 see also 5 notes 6 references 7 external links meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the scale in late a tropical disturbance developed near the caroline islands tracking generally west northwestward the system gradually became more defined on convection associated with the system quickly increased prompting the issuance of a tropical cyclone formation alert from the joint typhoon warning center jtwc 4 early on the japan meteorological agency jma began monitoring the system as a tropical depression at which time the system was situated roughly north northeast of palau 5 following a satellite derived surface wind estimate of later that day the jtwc also began monitoring the low as a tropical depression initially forecast models showed the system continuing on an arcing path out to sea however the system turned westward on and threatened the philippines 4 due to the proximity to the country the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name uring 6 late on the depression turned west southwestward towards the visayas in response to an approaching cold front an event typical of late season cyclones in the basin 7 on both the jtwc and jma upgraded the system to a tropical storm with the latter assigning it the name thelma 4 5 hours before striking the philippines on both agencies reported thelma to have reached its peak intensity the jtwc estimated the storm to have attained one minute sustained winds of while the jma estimated ten minute sustained winds at additionally its barometric pressure reached 992 mbar hpa 29.29 inhg 4 5 thelma soon made landfall in samar before weakening to a minimal tropical storm maintaining gale force winds the system eventually passed over palawan island on before moving over the south china sea despite being back over water strong wind shear prevented re intensification and caused thelma to weaken to a tropical depression by now moving westward the depression eventually made its final landfall over the mekong river delta in southern vietnam on 4 over the next couple of days the system weakened into an area of low pressure as it moved westwards before it moved into the andaman sea during november 10 8 once in the andaman sea the systems remnants contributed to the formation of the karaikal tropical cyclone during the next day 8 impact edit tropical storm thelma over the visayas on tropical storm thelma struck the philippines just five months after the ultra plinian eruption of mount pinatubo the eruption resulted in the deaths of roughly and left nearly homeless the government was reportedly struggling to deal with the scope of the disaster and the addition of thelma worsened the situation 9 striking the nation as a weak tropical storm winds from thelma gusted up to in tacloban 10 these winds caused no known damage the main destructive force associated with the cyclone was the tremendous rainfall it produced more than of rain across much of the visayas resulting in widespread flooding 4 in tacloban fell over a span the heaviest rain occurred on leyte island due to orographic lift which brought large quantities of moisture into the atmosphere over a relatively small area additionally monsoonal winds to the southwest of thelma converged over the island further enhancing the precipitation near the city of ormoc a philippine national oil company rain gauge measured of precipitation the highest in relation to the storm of this approximately fell during a three hour span around noon local time on 7 initially residents believed that waterspouts transported tremendous amounts of water to the island triggering the floods this notion was quickly dismissed as improbable however 11 the hardest hit region was leyte where more than lost their lives a total of were destroyed while another damaged the majority of casualties and damage took place in ormoc when a flash flood devastated the city at least were killed outside ormoc and another missing their lives in burauen 11 the entire island of leyte was left without power and many areas were isolated as roads were washed away 12 another perished and were left missing in negros occidental losses from the storm amounted to in leyte and in negros occidental a total of were affected while an estimated were left homeless by the storm across the philippines 13 14 ormoc city tragedy edit location of ormoc on leyte island the greatest tragedy during tropical storm thelma took place in the city of ormoc after torrential rains overwhelmed the watershed sending flood waters rushing down the deforested mountainside 15 this water flowed into the anilao and malbasag rivers located north of ormoc 16 the watershed covering an area of 4,567 hectares 11,285 acres is only forested with the remainder being used for agricultural and private purposes 15 according to a study in 1990 roughly of the watershed had been converted into coconut and sugarcane plantations the majority of this land was improperly cultivated since the 1970s making conditions worse than they normally would have been 17 the natural structure of the mountains further contributed to the floods with slopes as steep as grade in some areas in heavy rain events this feature leaves the upper two thirds of the mountain range unstable 16 in the two hours prior to the heaviest rains the soil in the watershed became saturated greatly lessening its effectiveness at absorbing further rains as a result the tremendous rains that occurred just prior to the flood during which rainfall rates reached per hour the land was unable to absorb a majority of the rain many landslides ranging from 1 to 3.3 to deep and 50 to 160 to wide occurred across the region 15 altogether rains were twice as heavy as the land could handle and the many landslips doubled the volume of fluids 18 at various points along rivers temporary dams created by debris namely trees allowed a build up of water upstream in some instances waters reached a depth of before the dams collapsed 16 normally it takes water in the anilao and malbasag rivers roughly 3.6 and respectively to reach ormoc city however it only took one hour during the flood 15 ormoc city itself is located in a flood prone area with the anilao and malbasag rivers converging just north of the city and taking a turn towards the bay in addition to the natural dangers of the river poorly designed structures on the river made conditions worse 17 the majority of construction along the river did not take flooding threats into account and actually increased the threat of these events 18 concrete walls and levees were built into the river rather than on the banks leading to faster debris damming lastly just after the turn was the cogon bridge this structure constricted the river by as much as enhancing the build up of water the turn became the final trigger in the disaster as it created an instantaneous backwater effect causing massive volumes of water to over top the riverbank 17 around local time on approximately 3 3 of water inundated 2 2 of the city 13 16 in just the water rose by and further rose to within an hour 16 19 the flooding lasted for roughly three hours leaving up to of sediment behind 16 the waters kept rising we had to place our children on top of the refrigerator still the waters kept going up so we all had to climb to the roof but perhaps we are bless we all survived survivor from isle verde 20 the flood struck the city with little to no warning catching all those in its path off guard 21 numerous low income families lived along the banks of the river despite being such a high risk area residential and commercial areas were also set up along reclaimed embankments that restricted river flow additionally squatters were allowed to live along the banks of the anilao river in an area called isle verde 17 roughly lived on this reclaimed land prior to the flood the majority of fatalities took place along the banks of the river with most drowning or being buried in mud or debris a survivor described the initial event as a gigantic wave crashing over the banks and flooding the city isle verde was virtually wiped out and out of the original that lived there only it became known as the isle of death to survivors 20 residents reported hundreds of bodies floating down rivers in the area 19 the force of the water and mud was enough to crack the walls of city hall 12 nearly were destroyed and more than were damaged 11 in the city alone officials confirmed that were killed and another left missing 21 22 additionally were injured 11 the majority of those missing were likely swept out to sea by the flood and presumed dead 12 two days after the storm several bodies of those swept out to sea washed back ashore 23 officials stated that the death toll could have been in the tens of thousands had the flood occurred at night rather than in the middle of the day 12 aftermath edit it looked like it was a nazi death camp children and old people were piled on top of each other cebu provincial governor lito osmena 12 initially it took more than for word of the level of devastation to reach officials in manila as communications across leyte were largely destroyed 19 by search and rescue operations were underway across leyte and negros occidental the first shipment of relief supplies consisting of food rations rice sardines and used clothing was to be shipped from cebu later that day 13 on philippine president corazon aquino declared all of leyte a disaster area 24 a philippine navy vessel set out with heavy earth moving machinery and the philippine air force deployed aircraft to assist in rescue efforts relief efforts in ormoc city were hampered by a lack of clear roads and fuel amateur radio reports stated that an ac 130 was able to land at a local airport but materials had to be moved by helicopter from there since roads were blocked 13 relief efforts were also hampered by continuing rains and the rough terrain of the affected region 19 by approximately had been rescued and another evacuated from affected regions 13 supply distribution centers were established in ormoc providing residents with food water and materials by 13 people were given a can of sardines and of rice at these centers 24 these centers were only able to operate in daylight though due to a lack of fuel and transportation water was supplied in limited quantities from cebu medical and sanitation teams were deployed throughout the province with many coming from surrounding areas 13 residents searched through debris for lumber to construct makeshift coffins while others stacked bodies to be picked up by wheelbarrows or trucks 19 officials had difficulty determining how to best deal with mass casualties as bodies lay across the ormoc region many were found in the coastal barangays of linao camp downes and bantigue as well as the ormoc pier 22 in order to prevent the spread of disease mass graves were dug with buried on dump trucks were used to transport the dead to these sites as quickly as possible 25 as decomposition set in residents stated that the putrid smell was unbearable even months after the storm bodies were occasionally discovered some found in drainage systems 22 by four navy vessels were searching debris in the waters near ormoc for bodies 16 were recovered that day with more believed to be submerged in the bay 26 roads surrounding the city were finally cleared by however electricity remained out with the deployment of medical teams from japan hospitals in the region returned to full capacity by electricity and water had been and restored respectively the emergency phase of assistance ended on and coordination of disaster relief was returned to the philippines by that time national aid to ormoc reached with more than half coming from a presidential grant 13

house 912 of the that needed to be moved from the area those that were not moved were left on isle verde despite orders not to stay there 20 another resettlement project for was planned at the cost of 13 the sheer magnitude of the flood event in the watershed made the region more vulnerable to future flood events hillsides became more unstable and the rivers themselves were clogged with debris raising their water levels and widening their banks in a post disaster assessment in october 1992 it was stated that swift cooperation of all agencies from local to governmental was necessary to prevent tragedies of similar caliber in the future 18 it was urged that residents still living along the river banks be relocated to safer areas however by the time of the report people had already begun repopulating the area as a way of avoiding similar breaching of the riverbank it was suggested that the two rivers be dredged and possibly re channeled several points were also brought up about rehabilitating the landscape of the watershed reforestation contoured farming and redesigning of plantations to better retain rainwater 27 long term rehabilitation of the watershed was deemed necessary in addition to repairing infrastructure in ormoc 18 in 1993 following a request by the philippine government the japan international cooperation agency conducted as study on flood control for ormoc and other cities across the country in 1998 a usd construction project for flood mitigation was approved and later completed in 2001 that year tropical depression auring caused flooding of similar magnitude to thelma however the waters were properly diverted to the sea a sculpture and monument to the victims designed by architect maribeth ebcas and artist florence cinco respectively called gift of life was constructed on a 2 2 plot of land it was designed to also depict a need to respect nature and be a message of hope for residents in ormoc 22 due to the catastrophic loss of
