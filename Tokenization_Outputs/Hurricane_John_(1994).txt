affected hawaii johnston atoll alaska part of the 1994 pacific hurricane season and the 1994 pacific typhoon season hurricane john also known as typhoon john was both the longest lasting and the farthest traveling tropical cyclone ever observed john formed during the 1994 pacific hurricane season which had above average activity due to the el of 1 and peaked as a hurricane on the hurricane wind scale the highest categorization for hurricanes over the course of its existence it followed a 7 165 mile 13 280 km path from the eastern pacific to the western pacific and back to the central pacific lasting in total 2 because it existed in both the eastern and western pacific john was one of a small number of tropical cyclones to be designated as both a hurricane and a typhoon despite lasting for a full month john barely affected land at all bringing only minimal effects to the hawaiian islands and the united states military base on johnston atoll its remnants later affected alaska contents 1 meteorological history 2 forecasting difficulties 3 records 4 impact 5 see also 6 references 7 external links meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the scale the origins of hurricane john were thought by the united states national hurricane center nhc to be from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of africa on july 25 1994 3 4 the wave subsequently moved across the atlantic ocean and caribbean without distinction before it crossed central america and moved into the eastern pacific ocean on or around august 8 3 4 upon entering the eastern pacific the wave gradually developed before the nhc initiated advisories on the system and designated it as tropical depression ten e during august 11 5 the system was at this time moving westwards and located around 345 miles to the south southeast of acapulco mexico 3 4 quickly developing banding features and well defined outflow it was upgraded to a tropical storm and named john later that day 2 a strong ridge of high pressure over the northeastern pacific ocean forced john westward where upper level wind shear kept john a tropical storm intensity fluctuated considerably however as shear levels varied more than once shear cleared away most of the clouds above john and nearly caused it to weaken to a tropical depression 2 however after eight days of slow westward movement across the pacific ocean shear lessened greatly on august 19 and john intensified significantly and was designated as a hurricane at 1700 pdt during an eighteen hour period between august 19 and august 20 john further strengthened from a weak hurricane to a major hurricane around 1100 pdt on august 20 it crossed into the central pacific the first of three basin crosses john would make 2 after entering the central pacific john left the area monitored by the nhc and was instead monitored by the central pacific hurricane center cphc as it moved slowly westward hurricane john continued to strengthen considerably in an increasingly favorable environment well south of the hawaiian islands on 22 august john was designated a hurricane on the hurricane scale the highest classification for hurricanes and later that day by hawaii standard time reached its peak winds of per hour 6 also on august 22 by hawaii standard time john made its closest approach to the hawaiian islands to the south john had threatened to turn north and affect the islands days before but the ridge of high pressure that typically shields the islands from hurricanes kept john on its southerly path nonetheless heavy rains and wind from the outer bands of john affected the islands 6 with the hawaiian islands behind it john began a slow turn to the north taking near direct aim at johnston atoll a small group of islands populated only by a united states military base the storm slowly weakened from its peak as a hurricane in the face of increasing shear dropping down to a hurricane with per hour maximum winds on august 25 local time john made its closest approach to the johnston atoll only to the north on johnston atoll sustained winds were reported up to per hour the equivalent of a strong tropical storm and gusts up to per hour were recorded 7 hurricane john at its tertiary peak strength in the far north central pacific ocean there is also an extratropical cyclone attached north of john clearing johnston atoll john turned to the northwest and began strengthening again as shear decreased on august 27 local time john reached a secondary peak strength of per hour and shortly thereafter it crossed the international date line at approximately n and came under the surveillance of the guam branch of the joint typhoon warning center jtwc by crossing into the western pacific john also became a typhoon and was referred to as typhoon john during its time in the western pacific 7 immediately after crossing the date line john again weakened and its forward motion stalled by september 1 john had weakened to a tropical storm and was nearly motionless just west of the date line there john lingered for six days while performing a multi day counterclockwise loop on september 7 a trough moved into the area and quickly moved john to the northeast john crossed the date line again on september 8 and reentered the central pacific 7 after reentering the central pacific john briefly reached a tertiary peak strength of per hour a strong hurricane well to the north of midway island however the trough was rapidly pulling apart structure and the cold waters of the northern central pacific were not conducive to a tropical cyclone on september 10 the 120th advisory was released on the system finally declaring john to have become extratropical approximately south of unalaska island 7 forecasting difficulties edit during time in the western north pacific the joint typhoon warning center jtwc had particular difficulty in forecasting and even estimating the strength of john john weakened considerably after entering the western north pacific and before estimates were later revised four consecutive advisories were issued that declared john a tropical depression each of these advisories called for imminent dissipation as john persisted and did not dissipate as the jtwc had predicted it was upgraded to a minimal tropical storm in the next advisory at the same time however two separate ship reports indicated that john had sustained winds of at least 55 knots far stronger than the advisory strength of john would go on to restrengthen into a strong hurricane after reentering the central north pacific defying all jtwc predictions after later reanalysis the jtwc raised the estimated wind speeds of john for every advisory from 1200 utc september 1 to its final advisory exactly a week later by at least and as much as 8 records edit its 31 day existence made john the longest lasting tropical cyclone recorded in both the pacific ocean and worldwide surpassing both hurricane tina s previous record in the pacific of in the 1992 season and the 1899 san ciriaco hurricane s previous world record of in the 1899 atlantic season 9 in addition despite its slow movement throughout much of its path john was the farthest traveling tropical cyclone in both pacific ocean and worldwide with a distance traveled of out distancing previous record holders hurricane fico in the pacific of in the 1978 season and hurricane faith worldwide of in the 1966 atlantic season 10 pressure readings from peak are not consistently available as the cphc did not monitor pressures at the time but air force reserve aircraft did measure a surface pressure of 929 mbar hpa making john one of the most intense hurricanes recorded in the central pacific both hurricane emilia and hurricane gilma recorded a lower pressure in the central pacific earlier in the 1994 season but with lower wind speeds intensity is measured by minimum central pressure which correlates with but is not directly linked to wind speeds john was also only the fourth hurricane recorded in the central pacific the first was hurricane patsy in 1959 the second was hurricane emilia and the third one was hurricane gilma both earlier in 1994 and possessed the highest recorded wind speed in a central pacific hurricane 6 since 1994 only one hurricane hurricane ioke has formed in or entered into the central pacific ioke like emilia and gilma had a lower central pressure but lower wind speeds than john however pressure record is incomplete the reading was only measured when the winds were there is no pressure reading when it had winds of so it could have been stronger than emilia gilma or ioke 11 john was the first eastern pacific hurricane to also exist as a typhoon a feat only matched by hurricane genevieve in 2014 12 additionally counting only storms recognized by all north pacific official regional specialized meteorological centers john was only the third of five tropical cyclones to exist in all three tropical cyclone basins in the pacific ocean the others were tropical storm georgette and hurricanes li dora and genevieve in 1986 earlier in 1994 1999 and 2014 respectively 13 14 15 16 also john was the fifth of seven tropical cyclones to enter the central pacific from the western pacific hurricanes patsy and skip and tropical storms virginia and carmen in 1959 1985 1968 and 1980 respectively had done so previously and only tropical depression 17w and tropical storm omeka in 1996 and 2010 respectively did so later 7 13 15 16 finally john was one of only five tropical cyclones to cross the date line twice alongside hurricanes patsy and skip tropical storm carmen and tropical depression 17w 13 17 impact edit satellite image of hurricane john as a storm with winds of john affected both the hawaiian islands and johnston atoll but only lightly while john passed over to the south of hawai i the islands did experience strengthened trade winds and rough surf along the southeast and south facing shores and while moving westward on west facing shores as well 7 the waves ranging from 6 to 1.8 to in height flooded beach parks in kailua kona 18 additionally heavy rains on the big island of hawai i caused minor localized flooding and some short term road closures no deaths injuries or significant damages were reported in hawai i 7 although john passed within of johnston atoll it had weakened greatly to a system by closest approach 7 prior to the arrival waves between 20 and 6.1 and were reported on the island 19 additionally in the northern hemisphere the strongest winds and heaviest rain lie to the north of a tropical cyclone so the atoll which lay to the south of the path was spared the brunt of the storm nonetheless the 1 100 man personnel for the united states military base on johnston atoll had been evacuated to honolulu as a precaution while john approached damage to structures was considerable but the size of the island and relative functionality of the base led to low damage monetary losses were estimated at close to 1994 us 7 the remnants of john moved through the aleutian islands producing a wind gust of in unalaska the storm brought a plume of warm air and two stations recorded a high temperature of 20 see also edit tropical cyclones portal hurricane dora 1999 hurricane genevieve 2014 references edit
