working at the massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge in particular he has specialized in atmospheric convection and the mechanisms acting to intensify hurricanes he was named one of the time 100 influential people of 2006 1 in 2007 he was elected as a member of the u s national academy of sciences 2 he hypothesized in 1994 about a superpowerful type of hurricane which could be formed if average sea surface temperature increased another 15c more than ever been see hypercane in a march 2008 paper published in the bulletin of the american meteorological society he put forward the conclusion that global warming is likely to increase the intensity but decrease the frequency of hurricane and cyclone activity 3 gabriel vecchi of noaa said of announcement while his results rule out the possibility that global warming has contributed to the recent increase in activity in the atlantic they suggest that other in addition to global likely to have been substantial contributors to the observed increase in activity 4 in 2013 with other leading experts he was co author of an open letter to policy makers which stated that continued opposition to nuclear power threatens ability to avoid dangerous climate change 5 along with daniel h rothman emanuel co founded the mit lorenz center named for edward n lorenz 6 7 contents 1 see also 2 references 3 selected publications 4 external

2009-01-19 the weight of available evidence suggests that multidecadal variability of hurricane season tropical atlantic sst and northern hemispheric surface temperature is controlled mostly by time varying radiative forcing owing to solar variability major volcanic eruptions and anthropogenic sulfate aerosols and greenhouse gases though the response to this forcing may be modulated by natural
