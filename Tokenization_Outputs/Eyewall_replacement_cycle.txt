eyewall replacement cycle wikipedia eyewall replacement cycle from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search hurricane juliette a rare case of triple eyewalls eyewall replacement cycles also called concentric eyewall cycles naturally occur in intense tropical cyclones generally with winds greater than or major hurricanes category 3 or above when tropical cyclones reach this intensity and the eyewall contracts or is already sufficiently small some of the outer rainbands may strengthen and organize into a ring of outer slowly moves inward and robs the inner eyewall of its needed moisture and angular momentum since the strongest winds are in a eyewall the tropical cyclone usually weakens during this phase as the inner wall is choked by the outer wall eventually the outer eyewall replaces the inner one completely and the storm may re intensify 1 the discovery of this process was partially responsible for the end of the u s hurricane modification experiment project stormfury this project set out to seed clouds outside the eyewall apparently causing a new eyewall to form and weakening the storm when it was discovered that this was a natural process due to hurricane dynamics the project was quickly abandoned 2 almost every intense hurricane undergoes at least one of these cycles during its existence recent studies have shown that nearly half of all tropical cyclones and nearly all cyclones with sustained winds over 204 kilometres per hour undergo eyewall replacement cycles 3 hurricane allen in 1980 went through repeated eyewall replacement cycles fluctuating between and status on the saffir simpson hurricane scale several times hurricane juliette 2001 was a rare documented case of triple eyewalls 4 typhoon june 1975 was the first reported case of triple eyewalls 5 contents 1 history 1.1 project stormfury 2 secondary eyewall formation 2.1 identification 2.2 early formation hypotheses 2.3 vortex rossby wave hypothesis 2.4

the crew and personnel of project stormfury the first tropical system to be observed with concentric eyewalls was typhoon sarah by fortner in 1956 which he described as an eye within an eye 6 the storm was observed by a reconnaissance aircraft to have an inner eyewall at 6 kilometres and an outer eyewall at 28 kilometres during a subsequent flight 8 hours later the inner eyewall had disappeared the outer eyewall had reduced to 16 kilometres and the maximum sustained winds and hurricane intensity had decreased 6 the next hurricane observed to have concentric eyewalls was hurricane donna in 1960 7 radar from reconnaissance aircraft showed an inner eye that varied from 10 miles at low altitude to 13 miles near the tropopause in between the two eyewalls was an area of clear skies that extended vertically from 3,000 feet to 25,000 feet the low level clouds at around 3,000 feet were described as stratocumulus with concentric horizontal rolls the outer eyewall was reported to reach heights near 45,000 feet while the inner eyewall only extended to 30,000 feet 12 hours after identifying concentric eyewalls the inner eyewall had dissipated 7 hurricane beulah in 1967 was the first tropical cyclone to have its eyewall replacement cycle observed from beginning to end 8 previous observations of concentric eyewalls were from aircraft based platforms beulah was observed from the puerto rico land based radar for 34 hours during which time a double eyewall formed and dissipated it was noted that beulah reached maximum intensity immediately prior to undergoing the eyewall replacement cycle and that it was probably more than a coincidence 8 previous eyewall replacement cycles had been observed to decrease the intensity of the storm 6 but at this time the dynamics of why it occurred was not known citation needed as early as 1946 it was known that the introduction of carbon dioxide ice or silver iodide into clouds that contained supercooled water would convert some of the droplets into ice followed by the process of growth of the ice particles at the expense of the droplets the water of which would all end up in large ice particles the increased rate of precipitation would result in dissipation of the storm 9 by early 1960 the working theory was that the eyewall of a hurricane was inertially unstable and that the clouds had a large amount of supercooled water therefore seeding the storm outside the eyewall would release more latent heat and cause the eyewall to expand the expansion of the eyewall would be accompanied with a decrease in the maximum wind speed through conservation of angular momentum 9 project stormfury edit main article project stormfury project stormfury was an attempt to weaken tropical cyclones by flying aircraft into them and seeding with silver iodide the project was run by the united states government from 1962 to 1983 10 the hypothesis was that the silver iodide would cause supercooled water in the storm to freeze disrupting the inner structure of the hurricane this led to the seeding of several atlantic hurricanes however it was later shown that this hypothesis was incorrect 9 in reality it was determined most hurricanes do not contain enough supercooled water for cloud seeding to be effective additionally researchers found that unseeded hurricanes often undergo the eyewall replacement cycles that were expected from seeded hurricanes this finding called successes into question as the changes reported now had a natural explanation 10 the last experimental flight was flown in 1971 due to a lack of candidate storms and a changeover in noaa s fleet more than a decade after the last modification experiment project stormfury was officially canceled although a failure in its goal of reducing the destructiveness of hurricanes project stormfury was not without merit the observational data and storm lifecycle research generated by stormfury helped improve meteorologists ability to forecast the movement and intensity of future hurricanes 9 secondary eyewall formation edit imagery from tropical rainfall measuring mission shows the beginning of an eyewall replacement cycle in hurricane frances secondary eyewalls were once considered a rare phenomenon since the advent of reconnaissance airplanes and microwave satellite data it has been observed that over half of all major tropical cyclones develop at least one secondary eyewall 3 11 there have been many hypotheses that attempt to explain the formation of secondary eyewalls the reason why hurricanes develop secondary eyewalls is not well understood 12 identification edit qualitatively identifying secondary eyewalls is easy for a hurricane analyst to do it involves looking at satellite or radar imagery and seeing if there are two concentric rings of enhanced convection the outer eyewall is generally almost circular and concentric with the inner eyewall quantitative analysis is more difficult since there exists no objective definition of what a secondary eyewall is kossin et al specified that the outer ring had to be visibly separated from the inner eye with at least 75% closed with a moat region clear of clouds 13 while secondary eyewalls have been seen as a tropical cyclone is nearing land none have been observed while the eye is not over the ocean july offers the best background environmental conditions for development of a secondary eyewall citation needed changes in the intensity of strong hurricanes such as katrina ophelia and rita occurred simultaneously with eyewall replacement cycles and comprised interactions between the eyewalls rainbands and outside environments 13 14 eyewall replacement cycles such as occurred in rita as it approached the gulf coast of the united states can greatly increase the size of tropical cyclones while simultaneously decreasing in strength 15 during the period from 45 eyewall replacement cycles were observed in the tropical north atlantic ocean 12 in the eastern north pacific and 2 in the western north pacific 12% of all atlantic storms and 5% of storms in the pacific underwent eyewall replacement during this time period in the north atlantic 70% of major hurricanes had at least one eyewall replacement compared to 33% of all storms in the pacific 33% of major hurricanes and 16% of all hurricanes had an eyewall replacement cycle stronger storms have a higher probability of forming a secondary eyewall with 60% of category 5 hurricanes underwent an eyewall replacement cycle within 12 hours 13 during the years 1969-1971 93 storms reached tropical storm strength or greater in the pacific ocean 8 of the 15 that reached super typhoon strength 11 of the 49 storms that reached typhoon strength and none of the 29 tropical storms developed concentric eyewalls the authors note that because the reconnaissance aircraft were not specifically looking for double eyewall features these numbers are likely underestimates 3 during the years 1949-1983 1268 typhoons were observed in the western pacific 76 of these had concentric eyewalls of all the typhoons that underwent eyewall replacement around 60% did so only once 40% had more than one eyewall replacement cycle with two of the typhoons each experiencing five eyewall replacements the number of storms with eyewall replacement cycles was strongly correlated with the strength of the storm stronger typhoons were much more likely to have concentric eyewalls there were no cases of double eyewalls where the maximum sustained wind was less than or the minimum pressure was higher than 970 hpa more than three quarters of the typhoons that had pressures lower than 970 hpa developed the double eyewall feature the majority of western and central pacific typhoons that experience double eyewalls do so in the vicinity of guam 5 early formation hypotheses edit concentric eyewalls seen in typhoon haima as it travels west across the pacific ocean since eyewall replacement cycles were discovered to be natural there has been a strong interest in trying to identify what causes them there have been many hypotheses put forth that are now abandoned in 1980 hurricane allen crossed the mountainous region of haiti and simultaneously developed a secondary eyewall hawkins noted this and hypothesized that the secondary eyewall may have been caused by topographic forcing 16 willoughby suggested that a resonance between the inertial period and asymmetric friction may be the cause of secondary eyewalls 17 later modeling studies and observations have shown that outer eyewalls may develop in areas uninfluenced by land processes there have been many hypotheses suggesting a link between synoptic scale features and secondary eyewall replacement it has been observed that radially inward traveling wave like disturbances have preceded the rapid development of tropical disturbances to tropical cyclones it has been hypothesized that this synoptic scale internal forcing could lead to a secondary eyewall 18 rapid deepening of the tropical low in connection with synoptic scale forcing has been observed in multiple storms 19 but has been shown to not be a necessary condition for the formation of a secondary eyewall 12 the wind induced surface heat exchange wishe is a positive feedback mechanism between the ocean and atmosphere in which a stronger ocean to atmosphere heat flux results in a stronger atmospheric circulation which results in a strong heat flux 20 wishe has been proposed as a method of generating secondary eyewalls 21 later work has shown that while wishe is a necessary condition to amplify disturbances it is not needed to generate them 12 vortex rossby wave hypothesis edit in the vortex rossby wave hypothesis the waves travel radially outward from the inner vortex the waves amplify angular momentum at a radius that is dependent on the radial velocity matching that of the outside flow at this point the two are phase locked and allow the coalescence of the waves to form a secondary eyewall 14 22 axisymmetrization hypothesis edit in a fluid system beta is the spatial usually horizontal change in the environmental vertical vorticity is maximized in the eyewall of a tropical cyclone the axisymmetrization bsa assumes that a tropical cyclone about to develop a secondary eye will have a decreasing but non negative that extends from the eyewall to approximately 50 kilometres to 100 kilometres from the eyewall in this region there is a small but important this area is called the outward of the skirt is effectively zero 12 convective available potential energy cape is the amount of energy a parcel of air would have if lifted a certain distance vertically through the atmosphere the higher the cape the more likely there will be convection if areas of high cape exist in the the deep convection that forms would act as a source of vorticity and turbulence kinetic energy this small scale energy will upscale into a jet around the storm the low level jet focuses the stochastic energy a nearly axisymmetric ring around the eye once this low level jet forms a positive feedback cycle such as wishe can amplify the initial perturbations into a secondary eyewall 12 23 death of the inner eyewall edit after the secondary eyewall totally surrounds the inner eyewall it begins to affect the tropical cyclone dynamics hurricanes are fueled by the high ocean temperature sea surface temperatures immediately underneath a tropical cyclone can be several degrees cooler than those at the periphery of a storm and therefore cyclones are dependent upon receiving the energy from the ocean from the inward spiraling winds when an outer eyewall is formed the moisture and angular momentum necessary for the maintenance of the inner eyewall is now being used to sustain the outer eyewall causing the inner eye to weaken and dissipate leaving the tropical cyclone with one eye that is larger in diameter than the previous eye a microwave pass of cyclone phailin revealing the moat between the inner and outer eyewalls in the moat region between the inner and outer eyewall observations by dropsondes have shown high temperatures and dewpoint depressions the eyewall contracts because of inertial instability 24 contraction of the eyewall occurs if the area of convection occurs outside the radius of maximum winds after the outer eyewall forms subsidence increases rapidly in the moat region 25 once the inner eyewall dissipates the storm weakens the central pressure increases and the maximum sustained windspeed decreases rapid changes in the intensity of tropical cyclones is a typical characteristic of eyewall replacement cycles 25 compared to the processes involved with the formation of the secondary eyewall the death of the inner eyewall is fairly well understood some tropical cyclones with extremely large outer eyewalls do not experience the contraction of the outer eye and subsequent dissipation of the inner eye typhoon winnie 1997 developed an outer eyewall with a diameter of 200 kilometres that did not dissipate until it reached the shoreline 26 the time required for the eyewall to collapse is inversely related to the diameter of the eyewall which is mostly because inward directed wind decreases asymptotically to zero with distance from the radius of maximum winds but also due to the distance required to collapse the eyewall 24 throughout the entire vertical layer of the moat there is dry descending air the dynamics of the moat region are similar to the eye while the outer eyewall takes on the dynamics of the primary eyewall the vertical structure of the eye has two layers the largest layer is that from the top of the tropopause to a capping layer around 700 hpa which is described by descending warm air below the capping layer the air is moist and has convection with the presence of stratocumulus clouds the moat gradually takes on the characteristics of the eye upon which the inner eyewall can only dissipate in strength as the majority of the inflow is now being used to maintain the outer eyewall the inner eye is eventually evaporated as it is warmed by the surrounding dry air in the moat and eye models and observations show that once the outer eyewall completely surrounds the inner eye it takes less than 12 hours for the complete dissipation of the inner eyewall the inner eyewall feeds mostly upon the moist air in the lower portion of the eye before evaporating 14 evolution into an annular hurricane edit main article annular tropical cyclone annular hurricanes have a single eyewall that is larger and circularly symmetric observations show that an eyewall replacement cycle can lead to the development of an annular hurricane while some hurricanes develop into annular hurricanes without an eyewall replacement it has been hypothesized that the dynamics leading to the formation of a secondary eyewall may be similar to those needed for development of an annular eye 13 hurricane daniel 2006 and typhoon winnie 1997 were examples where a storm had an eyewall replacement cycle and then turned into an annular hurricane 27 annular hurricanes have been simulated that have gone through the life cycle of an eyewall replacement the simulations show that the major rainbands will grow such that the arms will overlap and then it spiral into itself to form a concentric eyewall the inner eyewall dissipates leaving a hurricane with a singular large eye with no rainbands 28 references edit sitkowski matthew kossin james p rozoff christopher m 2011-06-03 intensity and structure
