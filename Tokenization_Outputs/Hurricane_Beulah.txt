1967 usd areas affected greater antilles peninsula northeast mexico south texas part of the 1967 atlantic hurricane season hurricane beulah was the second tropical storm second hurricane and only major hurricane during the 1967 atlantic hurricane season it tracked through the caribbean struck the peninsula of mexico as a major hurricane and moved west northwest into the gulf of mexico briefly gaining category 5 intensity it was the strongest hurricane during the 1967 atlantic hurricane season the hurricane made landfall just north of the mouth of the rio grande river as a it spawned 115 tornadoes across texas which established a new record for the highest amount of tornadoes produced by a tropical cyclone due to its slow movement over texas beulah led to significant flooding at the time beulah ranked as the second costliest hurricane on record having left roughly 1967 usd in damage only hurricane betsy two years prior had caused such considerable losses throughout its path at

convection and thunderstorm of the western high plateau in cameroon over central africa reaching the western slopes of the mountains two days later the tropical wave became more coherent with clouds condensing along its axis as it moved over west africa cyclonic rotation became apparent about above the surface a research paper published in 1969 refers to the disturbance as a depression as it neared the west coast of africa 1 however this significantly differs from the official atlantic hurricane database which does not mention the system at that time 2 as a surface circulation likely did not exist regardless the system emerged over the atlantic ocean around on as represented by barometric pressure falls in dakar senegal 1 once over water the system interacted with the intertropical convergence zone and continued westward along an undulating path with no further organization it was not until a united states navy weather reconnaissance plane flew into the disturbance on while it was located east of the lesser antilles that signs of development were apparent corresponding observations from ships in the region on confirmed the existence of a 1010 mbar hpa 28.23 inhg low pressure area 3 in light of this the disturbance was classified as a tropical depression at 12 00 utc that day with its center situated roughly east northeast of barbados 2 a slow moving system the depression steadily organized as it approached the lesser antilles observations from aircraft reconnaissance indicated that the system attained gale force winds by on resulting in its upgrade to a tropical storm it was also assigned the name beulah making it the second named storm of the 1967 season shortly after being named beulah clipped the southern coast of martinique and entered the eastern caribbean sea feeding off the warm waters of the caribbean the cyclone quickly strengthened and reached hurricane intensity by on rapid deepening ensued thereafter with the central pressure falling to hpa the following day as it passed south of puerto rico 3 at this time winds were estimated to be at least ranking beulah as a on the hurricane scale 2 upon reaching this strength weather radar imagery from san juan puerto rico showed that beulah featured a wide eye surrounded by an intense eyewall about thick 4 radar images of hurricane beulah from 21 30 utc on september 9 to 03 30 utc on september 10 depicting its eyewall replacement cycle during the evening of beulah turned westward as weak ridge developed over the bahamas between it and the newly formed tropical storm doria 3 the powerful storm weakened somewhat as an eyewall replacement cycle began to take shape during this phase the inner eye of beulah contracted to roughly in diameter while a second eyewall spanned an area across the smaller eye soon dissipated and the larger one became the single dominant feature by the morning of the completion of this marked the first time that an eyewall replacement cycle was observed in its entirety 4 the aforementioned westward turn placed the dominican republic in the line of danger an area still reeling from the devastating effects of hurricane inez just one year prior fortunately the storm unexpectedly collapsed as it approached the barahona peninsula and struck the area as a greatly weakened though still significant hurricane with estimated winds of around on 3 2 skirting the southern coast of haiti s tiburon peninsula beulah further degraded to a tropical storm by the morning of unseasonably strong wind shear associated with the jet stream resulting from an upper level trough to the north and the interaction with land were responsible for the dramatic degradation by the time it had cleared haiti beulah was no more than a minimal tropical storm with winds near 3 its pressure had also risen by roughly hpa to hpa 2 originally seen as a threat to jamaica northeasterly flow induced a southerly component to the track and pushed the cyclone south of the island on the shear previously impeding organization abated on and a ridge re established itself to north allowing the storm to resume a west northwest to northwest track the upper level changes led to a favorable environment for intensification and beulah regained hurricane strength by on while located about south southeast of havana cuba 3 2 5 a composite satellite image on depicting hurricanes beulah bottom doria middle and chloe top moving through the climatologically favorable western caribbean 3 beulah quickly regained major hurricane status on with winds estimated at 2 the pressure fell to hpa on before some weakening took place beulah ultimately made landfall on cozumel island with winds of at least later that day and struck the mainland peninsula hours later despite moving over land little weakening took place by the time the hurricane emerged over the gulf of mexico about later 3 the hurricane maintained its intensity throughout as it moved west northwest to southern tamaulipas mexico 2 however on a pronounced phase of rapid intensification took place as beulah turned northwest to the rio grande valley region aircraft reconnaissance throughout the day found falling pressures and ultimately measured a value of hpa around this was the second lowest pressure ever recorded by aircraft at the time behind a hpa measurement in hurricane hattie of 1961 3 beulah was estimated to have achieved its peak intensity shortly thereafter as a hurricane with winds estimated at 2 regarded as the third largest hurricane on record at the time 6 beulah moved along a slowing erratic and somewhat cycloidal path slight weakening ensued as it neared land and beulah ultimately made its final landfall south of brownsville texas near the mouth of the rio grande river around on no direct measurements exist at the core of the hurricane as it moved ashore however based on a minimum pressure of hpa in brownsville the hurricane likely struck land at an intensity below that value 3 a vessel anchored in the port of brownsville measured peak wind gusts of equivalent to a low end hurricane 5 6 according to the national hurricane center beulah struck as a and had a pressure of hpa though a conclusive estimate awaits re evaluation as part of the atlantic hurricane reanalysis project 7 once over land the hurricane slowly weakened as it remained relatively close to the coast winds dropped below hurricane force on roughly after landfall the system subsequently stalled near alice texas before turning to the southwest 3 after diminishing to a tropical depression late on 2 circulation finally dissipated over the mountainous terrain of nuevo mexico 3 preparations edit nimbus satellite image of hurricane beulah over the eastern caribbean on hispaniola edit
