completed cost of 48 000 a design competition was held and won by architect lorimer rich nb 1 and sculptor thomas hudson jones an appropriation from congress for the work was secured and on december

with the sculpting on all four sides 4 7 quarrying the yule marble 3.9 miles south of marble colorado by the vermont marble company was a one year process beginning in 1930 the cap was quarried on the first attempt but the base required three tries the large middle block also required three tries in late january 1931 the 56 ton middle block was lifted out of the quarry the quarrying involved 75 men when the block was separated from the mountain inside the quarry it weighed 124 tons a wire saw was then brought into the quarry to cut the block down to 56 tons on february 3 the block reached the marble mill site in the town of marble after a four day trip from the quarry here it was crated then shipped to vermont on february 8 the block was sawn to final size in west rutland vermont and

medal of honor and the unknowns of world war ii and the korean war were interred in the plaza beside their world war i comrade 14 the unknown of vietnam edit the designation of the vietnam unknown has proven to be difficult with improvements in dna testing it is possible though unlikely that the recovered remains for every unknown soldier killed in the vietnam war will be identified the vietnam unknown service member was designated by medal of honor recipient u s marine corps sgt maj allan jay kellogg jr during a ceremony at pearl harbor hawaii may 17 1984 each branch of the armed services took part in the transportation to honor the unknown the marines from marine barracks hawaii consisted of an honor guard of 9 enlisted men and lt denis muller the vietnam unknown was transported

unknown over to the usaf on may 24 the next day the remains of the vietnam unknown were then flown from travis air force base california arriving at andrews air force base maryland once there the remains were turned over to the us army where the remains were taken to fort mcnair for placement upon the horse drawn wagon which later carried the unknown to the capital rotunda for display before interment while on display for public viewing all branches of the us armed forces stood in honor guarding the casket of the unknown for 2 weeks the tomb guards stood at death watch for the entire day

the vietnam unknown and also acted as next of kin by accepting the interment flag at the end of the ceremony the interment flags of all unknowns at the tomb of the unknowns are on view in the memorial display room identification of the unknown edit in 1994 ted sampley a pow mia activist determined that the remains of the vietnam unknown were likely those of air force 1st lt michael joseph blassie who was shot down near an vietnam in 1972 sampley published an article in his newsletter and contacted family who attempted to pursue the case with the air casualty office without result in january 1998 cbs news broadcast a report based on investigation which brought political pressure to support the identification of the remains 15 the body was exhumed on may 14 1998 based on mitochondrial dna testing department of defense scientists confirmed the remains were those of blassie the identification was announced on june 30 1998 and on july 10 remains arrived home to his family in st louis missouri he was reinterred at jefferson barracks national cemetery on july 11 16 nb 4 redesignation of the crypt edit the slab over the crypt that once held the remains of the vietnam unknown has since been replaced the original inscription of vietnam and the dates of the conflict has been changed to honoring and keeping faith with missing servicemen as a reminder of the commitment of the armed forces to the fullest possible accounting of missing service members tomb guards edit tomb of the unknown soldier guard identification badge the tomb guards are soldiers of the united states army the first military guards were troopers from the 3rd cavalry brave rifles who were posted nearby on fort myer since april 6 1948 known then as army day when the regiment was reactivated it has been guarded by soldiers from 3rd infantry regiment the old guard the old guard is also posted to fort myer virginia adjacent to arlington national cemetery it is considered one of the highest honors to serve as a sentinel at the tomb of the unknowns fewer than 20 percent of all volunteers are accepted for training and of those only a fraction pass training to become full fledged tomb guards this attrition rate has made the tomb of the unknown soldier guard identification badge the second least awarded qualification badge of the united states military the first being the astronaut badge 17 the soldier walking the mat does not wear rank insignia so as not to outrank the unknowns whatever their ranks may have been non commissioned officers usually the relief commander and assistant relief commanders do wear insignia of their rank when changing the guard only they have a separate uniform without rank that is worn when they actually guard the unknowns or are posted the duties of the sentinels are not purely ceremonial the sentinels will confront people who cross the barriers at the tomb or who they perceive to be disrespectful or excessively loud weapons edit over the years there have been several different types of weapons used by the tomb guards the changes in weapons reflect the changes in the army including m1903 springfield rifle m1 garand and m14 rifles m1911 and m9 pistols tomb guards currently carry m14 rifles which are unloaded and affixed to ceremonial rifle stocks these rifles are cleaned daily and kept ready for use at all times 18 walking the mat edit there is a meticulous routine that the guard follows when watching over the graves 19 the tomb guard marches 21 steps south down the black mat laid across the tomb turns and faces east toward the tomb for 21 seconds turns and faces north changes weapon to outside shoulder and waits 21 seconds marches 21 steps down the mat turns and faces east for 21 seconds turns and faces south changes weapon to outside shoulder and waits 21 seconds repeats the routine until the soldier is relieved of duty at the changing of the guard after each turn the guard executes a sharp shoulder arms movement to place the weapon on the shoulder closest to the visitors to signify that the guard stands between the tomb and any possible threat out of respect for the interred the sentinels command silence at the tombs if the guard walking the mat must vocally confront a disturbance from spectators or a threat the routine is interrupted and remains so until the disturbance is under control the sentinel will exit the mat place the weapon in port arms position and confront the disturbance once under control the sentinel then walks on the pavement to the other side of the mat turns to shoulder arms and continues the routine twenty one was chosen because it symbolizes the highest military honor that can be 21 gun salute the mat is usually replaced twice per year before memorial day and before veterans day this is required because of the wear on the rubber mat by the special shoes worn by tomb guards the sentinels have metal plates built into the soles and inner parts of their shoes to allow for a more rugged sole and to give the signature click of the heel during maneuvers the sentinels wear sunglasses because of the bright reflection from the marble surrounding the tomb and the memorial amphitheater on the ground not covered by the mat a rust pattern in the tile can be seen that corresponds to the precise steps taken during the changing of the guard the metal from the guards boots causes the brown rust markings on the stone on the mat itself footprints caused by standing guard are also visible changing of the guard edit changing of the guard 2005 while arlington national cemetery is open during the day in summer months from april 1 to september 30 the guard is changed every half hour during the winter months from october 1 to march 31 the guard is changed every hour after the cemetery closes to the public 7 p m to 8 a m april through september and 5 p m to 8 a m october through march the guard is changed every 2 hours the ceremony can be witnessed by the public whenever arlington national cemetery is open 20 21 the guard change is very symbolic but also conducted in accordance with army regulations the relief commander or assistant relief commander along with the oncoming guard are both required for a guard change to take place the relief commander orders the guard being relieved to pass on your orders to the oncoming guard the guard being relieved will say to the oncoming guard post and orders remain as directed the oncoming response is always orders acknowledged during changes when the public is witnessing the ceremony the commander will inform the public that the ceremony is about to take place and that those in attendance should remain silent and standing throughout the entire event dedication edit a civilian guard was first posted at the tomb on november 17 1925 to prevent among other things families from picnicking on the flat marble slab with views of the city a military guard was first posted on march 25 1926 the first 24 hour guard was posted on midnight july 2 1937 the tomb of the unknowns has been guarded continuously 24 hours a day 7 days a week since that time 22 inclement weather 23 24 terrorist attacks 25 et cetera do not cause the watch to cease 26 since 1948 the tomb guards a special platoon within the 3rd u s infantry regiment the old guard work on a team rotation of 24 hours on 24 hours off for five days taking the following four days off a guard takes an average of six hours to prepare his heavy wool regardless of the time of for the next work in addition to preparing the uniform guards also conduct physical training tomb guard training participate in field exercises cut their hair before the next work day and at times are involved in regimental functions as well tomb guards are required to memorize 17 pages of information about arlington national cemetery and the tomb of the unknown soldier including the locations of nearly 300 graves and who is buried in each one 20 a special army decoration the tomb of the unknown soldier guard identification badge is authorized for wear after passing a detailed test of 100 questions from a pool of more than 300 a uniform test with two gigs errors or fewer measured to the 1/64 and a test on the guard changing sequence after serving honorably for a period of nine months and having passed the sequence of tests a tomb guard is permanently awarded the badge since the first award on february 7 1958 fewer than 650 soldiers have completed training and been awarded this badge including four women a small number of tomb guard identification badges have also been retroactively awarded to soldiers who served as guards before 1959 those numbers make the badge the second rarest award currently issued in the united states army only the army astronaut badge is rarer nb 5 the badge was designed in 1956 and first issued to members of the honor guard at the tomb of the unknowns on february 7 1958 the badge was first issued only as a temporary wear item meaning the soldiers could only wear the badge during their tenure as members of the honor guard upon leaving the duty the badge was returned and reissued to incoming soldiers in 1963 a regulation was enacted that allowed the badge to be worn as a permanent part of the military uniform even after the completion of duty at the tomb of the unknowns damage and repair to the tomb monument edit the crack can be seen underneath the words an american and above the word soldier cracking and weathering are causing concerns for the long term preservation of the tomb monument a november 1963 report first recorded horizontal cracking of the marble die block though this was the first time that the damage was documented the report made it clear that the cracks had become visible some time before that date 27 in there were two to as primary and approximately 34 feet around the die block by 1974 they had extended to 40 feet they grew another 4.6 feet over the next 15 years inspection has determined that the cracks have increased horizontally since 1990 analysis also indicates that the cracks are not surficial but extend partially through the block and will eventually extend all the way through 27 the 1990 report documented deterioration of the surface as much as of the marble surface has been lost through weathering the study projected that before 2010 the tomb monument will have been weathered enough to have a negative effect on the experience of the visitors and concludes the only solutions are to enclose or replace the monument 27 several options have been considered to deal with the damage officials at arlington national cemetery determined that proper repair can return the tomb monument to an acceptable appearance however because the cracks will continue to lengthen and widen continuous grouting regrouting touch up monitoring and maintenance would be required therefore a report commissioned by arlington national cemetery and published in june 2006 confirmed the conclusion that replacement of the three pieces of the tomb monument is the preferred alternative a final decision was scheduled to be made on september 30 2007 27 the national trust for historic preservation objects to the plan to replace the authentic tomb monument the trust expressed concern that arlington national cemetery seeks to replace the existing monument with marble from the original quarry which experts agree is likely eventually to crack 28 the trust has observed that the own 1990 report recommended that the monument be repaired and that the cemetery in fact commissioned oehrlein architects to repair the stone in 2007 mary oehrlein informed congressional staff members that the existing monument can easily be repaired as was done 17 years ago using conventional conservation methods to re grout the cracks once repaired the fault lines would be virtually invisible from the public viewing areas 29 30 on september 26 2007 u s senator daniel akaka announced that an amendment crafted together with senator jim webb will be added to the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 h r 1585 that would require a report on the plans of the secretary of the army and the secretary of veterans affairs to replace the monument at the tomb of the unknowns the secretaries would be required to advise congress on the current efforts to maintain and preserve the monument additionally they would have to provide an assessment on the feasibility and advisability of repairing rather than replacing the tomb monument finally if the secretaries choose replacement they would have to report those plans and detail how they intend to dispose of the current monument once the report is provided the secretaries are prevented from taking action to replace the monument for at least 180 days the akaka webb amendment was included in the bill by unanimous consent of the senate 31 an amendment to the fiscal year 2008 defense authorization bill authorized a review of the condition the bill also authorized repair but not replacement of the monument 32 final passage of the national defense authorization act for 2008 h r 4986 was signed by president bush on january 28 2008 october 21 2011 completed repair of the cracks in the tomb in 2003 john haines a retired car dealer offered to donate a large slab of marble to the arlington national cemetery to replace the existing marble haines paid $31,000 for the marble slab 33 the marble was not removed from the quarry however because imperfections were found and the block was rejected in june 2009 arlington national cemetery and the u s army corps of engineers announced that the monument was to be repaired not replaced 34 in 2010 the cracks were filled but the repairs lasted only a few months 35 as of june 2011 the cemetery was struggling to repair the cracks in the monument one of which measured 28.4 feet long with another at 16.2 feet 36 in september 2011 the cracks were filled again 35 and on october 21 2011 inspection by the corps of engineers and other experts pronounced the repairs a success 37 see also edit civil war unknowns monument tomb of the unknown confederate soldier tomb of the
