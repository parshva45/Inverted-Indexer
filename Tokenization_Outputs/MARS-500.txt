mars 500 wikipedia mars 500 from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the official logo a 3d plan of the russia based mars 500 complex used for ground based experiments which complement iss based preparations for a manned mission to mars the mars 500 mission was a psychosocial isolation experiment conducted between 2007 and 2011 by russia the european space agency and china in preparation for an unspecified future manned spaceflight to the planet mars 1 the facility was located at the russian academy of sciences institute of biomedical problems ibmp in moscow russia 1 between 2007 and 2011 three different crews of volunteers lived and worked in a mock up spacecraft at ibmp the final stage of the experiment which was intended to simulate a 520 day manned mission was conducted by an all male crew consisting of three russians alexey sitev sukhrob kamolov alexander smoleevskij a frenchman romain charles an italian diego urbina and a chinese citizen yue wang the mock up facility simulated an earth mars shuttle spacecraft an ascent descent craft and the martian surface the volunteers who participated in the three stages included professionals with experience in engineering medicine biology and human spaceflight the experiment yielded important data on the physiological social and psychological effects of long term close quarters isolation

experiment was intended to yield valuable psychological and medical data on the effects of the planned long term deep space mission the experiment permitted the study of the technical challenges work capability of crew and management of long distance spaceflight communications lag autonomy resource rationing health conditions of isolation and hermetically closed confined environment are the main peculiarities of the martian flight scientific objectives edit the experiment was designed to allow planning the methods and means of control and monitoring of the habitat during lengthy crew stays in confined and cramped conditions planning diagnostic forecast and treatment of medical support and prophylaxis the use of telemedicine technologies countermeasures against adverse effect of the flight factors on the human body psychological support and the creation of a reporting system for activity of the crew and electronic transfer of information methods of psychological support and approbation using the sociomapping method 2 experiment stages edit a total of 640 experiment days were scheduled between 2007 and 2011 divided into three stages of differing length during each stage the crew of volunteers lived and worked in a mockup spacecraft communication with the outside world was limited and was conducted with a realistic time delay of up to 25 minutes to simulate the real life communications lag between mars and earth similarly a realistically limited supply of on board consumables was provided for the volunteers 3 some conditions such as weightlessness and cosmic radiation could not be simulated the first fifteen day stage of the mars 500 experiment took place from 15 november 2007 to 27 november 2007 4 the purpose of this stage was to test the technical equipment facilities and operating procedures for the voyage 5 the second 105 day stage of the mars 500 experiment began on 31 march 2009 when six volunteers started living in the isolated living complex 6 on 14 july 2009 this stage of the experiment was completed the 520 day final stage of the experiment which was intended to simulate a full length manned mission began on 3 june 2010 and ended on 4 november 2011 7 8 9 this stage was conducted by a six man international crew consisting of three russians a frenchman an italian colombian and a chinese citizen 9 the stage included a simulation of a manned mars landing with three simulated mars walks carried out on the 14th 18th and 22 february 2011 10 11 the experiment ended on 4 november 2011 with all the participants reportedly in optimal physical and psychological condition 9 in january 2013 the proceedings of the national academy of sciences reported that four of the six crew members had considerable problems sleeping and some avoided exercise and would hide away from the others in behaviour compared to animal hibernation 12 also circadian rhythm of autonomic nervous system activity was dampened during confinement 13 facility edit a labelled diagram of the experimental isolation facility the experiment facility was located on the institute of biomedical problems site in moscow the complex consisted of the isolation facility the mission operations room technical facilities and offices the isolation facility consisted of five different modules three of the modules the habitat utility and medical modules simulated the main spacecraft the fourth module simulated the martian lander ship and was connected to the main spacecraft the fifth module was a simulator of the martian surface and is connected to the martian lander the combined volume of the modules was 3 the facility included all the necessary equipment for running the experiment these included communications and control systems ventilation systems air and water supplies electrical installations sewage systems air and water quality monitoring and partial recycling systems medical equipment fire and other safety monitoring systems and emergency equipment the modules were maintained at earth normal barometric pressure 14 habitable module edit the habitable module was the main living quarters for the crew the cylindrical module consisted of six individual crew compartments a kitchen dining room a living room the main control room and a toilet the individual bedroom compartments which had an area of approximately 2 each contained a bed a desk a chair and shelves for personal belongings 15 medical module edit overhead plan of the experimental complex the cylindrical medical module measured and housed two medical berths a toilet and equipment for routine medical examinations it also contained equipment for telemedical laboratory and diagnostic investigations if a crew member had become ill they would have been isolated and treated in the module 14 mars landing module simulator edit the mars landing module simulator was only used during the 30 day mars orbiting phase of the experiment the cylindrical module accommodated up to three crew members and had three bunk beds two workstations and a toilet its ancillary systems included a control and data collection system a video control and communications system a gas analysis system an air conditioning and ventilation system a sewage system and water supply and a fire suppression system 14 storage module edit the cylindrical storage module was divided into four compartments 14 a refrigerated compartment for food storage a compartment for storage of non perishable food an experimental greenhouse a compartment containing a bathroom sauna and gym crew edit advertised volunteer requirements edit the mars 500 project posted a number of basic requirements for any potential candidates these are citation needed age years old higher education professional requirements general practitioner having skills of first medical aid physician investigator having skills of clinical laboratory diagnostics biologist engineer specialist in life support systems engineer specialist in computer science engineer specialist in electronics engineer mechanic language skills knowledge of the russian and english languages at a professional level crew of the first stage edit the crew of the first 15 day stage of the isolation experiment was composed of six russians five men and a woman 16 this stage of the experiment was conducted in november 2007 anton artamonov born 1982 engineer physicist and programmer oleg artemyev born 1970 engineer and cosmonaut alexander kovalev born 1982 engineer employed by telemedicine laboratory dmitry perfilov born 1975 anesthesiologist employed by telemedicine laboratory sergey ryazansky born 1974 crew commander physiologist and cosmonaut marina tugusheva born 1983 biologist ibmp researcher marina tugusheva the only woman of the crew was excluded from the longer missions to prevent sexual tension from jeopardising the mission 17 crew of the second stage edit the 105 day second stage involved a crew of six members and ended on 14 july 2009 18 oleg artemyev russian cosmonaut alexei baranov russian medical doctor cyrille fournier french airline pilot oliver knickel mechanical engineer in the german army sergey ryazansky commander russian cosmonaut alexei shpakov russian sports physiologist 2nd stage crew photo on russian wikipedia crew of the third stage edit more than 6,000 people from 40 countries applied for the 520 day third stage of the experiment 19 the selected volunteers were three russians two europeans and one chinese 20 they had a varying command of english but not all spoke russian 21 romain charles 31 year old french engineer 22 23 sukhrob rustamovich kamolov russian surgeon 19 24 alexey sergeyevich sitev russian engineer 19 and commander of the mission 25 alexandr egorovich smoleevskiy russian physiologist 19 25 diego urbina 27 year old italian colombian engineer 20 wang yue 27 year old chinese instructor at the china astronaut research and training center 24 26 the other member of the crew a replacement was mikhail sinelnikov a 37 year old russian engineer 19 the mission started on 3 june 2010 27 and concluded on 4 november 2011 whereupon the participants entered a four day quarantine before leaving the facility 9 28 satellite experiments edit during the mars 500 experiment related additional experiments aimed at studying the effects of radiation health problems associated with weightlessness the impact of fire on board the ship and others are conducted 29 cardiac experiments edit crew experiments included monthly operational research consisting of recording electrocardiogram respiratory samples and blood pressure and a questionnaire about lifestyle stress and possible complaints over the past month quarterly dynamic complex studies included measurement and recording of blood pressure and complex cardiorespiratory parameters during the performance of functional tests with physical mental and orthostatic load detailed questionnaires conducting psychological testing and standard outpatient dispensary studies were conducted before and after the series of studies immersion experiments edit because of the long stay in weightlessness the person gets hypokinetic disorders to study this phenomenon ibmp has been conducting research in this area for many years what allowed to construct a detailed picture of the make hypokinetic disorders the experimental results show that the main cause of violations was a change in the gravity dependent mechanisms that are responsible for motoric activity under the influence of gravity on the body the changes begin to occur because of the disruption of coordinated work of sensory systems in particular support and proprioceptive ones data obtained during the experiments suggest that the support afferentation in humans acts as a mechanism of activation and regulation of activity of the postural tonic system and that the lack of support is the reason for discharge of the physiological and morphological changes that are common in conditions of weightlessness and microgravity 29 the main purpose of the immersion experiments are to study effects of the flight including unloading on the support mechanisms of the body spinal supraspinal the state of the central nervous systems motor function and hand eye co ordination 30 hyperbaric experiments edit during the flight there is a risk of fire in the spacecraft and argon is planned as an inhibitor in the ships atmosphere to reduce this risk the use of argon can significantly reduce the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere of a spacecraft without any harm to the crew and to create a so called hypoxic environment hyperbaric experiments will complement the knowledge on the effect of fire resistant oxygen nitrogen argon mixture on the human body with the help of an integrated assessment of the body during a long stay in fire resistant mixture the tests will determine the level of mental and physical performance assess the state of the cardiorespiratory system hematological metabolic and immunological parameters in blood and conduct microbiological research and research that will improve existing support systems 31 radiological experiments edit to avoid health problems caused by irradiation during the flight to mars it is necessary to create a prediction model of radiation risk the model should describe the risk of radiation sickness depending on the total dose received decreased performance which causes an acute reaction and the possible reduction of the overall immune system resistance to the other health risks of interplanetary flight the prediction model is created by exposing a group of monkeys to a radiation source caesium 137 radiological experiments are then conducted to study the radiobiological reactions of the main regulatory body systems nervous endocrine immune cardiovascular hematopoietic and spermatozoa and cytogenetic response to irradiation and analysis of long term effects of exposure life expectancy and carcinogenesis the experiment uses male rhesus macaque aged years they are divided into groups of 10-15 monkeys in each group the experiments were designed so that mimic the real exposure of crew during the flight to mars including acute and chronic phases of disease 32 study of gastrointestinal tract edit among the space experiments on the medical biological section of the long term program of scientific and applied research and experiments planned for the russian segment of iss planned and put into effect an experiment splankh study of the structural functional state of various parts of the gastrointestinal tract to identify the specific changes in the digestive system in a space flight within the mars 500 project the crew did a 24 h electrogastroenterography study electrical activity of gastrointestinal tract using on board gastroenterograph splankh 1 developed by ibmp with rpc istok sistema based on the mass produced gastroenterograph gastroscan gem 33 34 35 psychological effects edit according to official results the crew of 520 day isolation underwent the trial as the single unit there were no conflict situations noted nor any situations requiring interference of the ground based services 36 the difficulties encountered during the performance of some complicated activities were overcome by the crew together it is worth saying that cultural differences and language difficulties did not bear any significant influence friendly and constructive communication is said to have prevailed throughout the experiment the crew spent enough time together watching films in different languages as an opportunity to see and discuss the seen films together the crew prepared surprises for birthdays major state holidays and informal holidays on october 31 they celebrated halloween it is possible to notice that the crew members somehow increased the time spent on individual activities which did not hamper communication there were no division of the crew along language lines or other interests to be noted the commander exercised his authority as both a formal and informal leader see also edit human
