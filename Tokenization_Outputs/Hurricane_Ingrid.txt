tropical cyclones along with hurricane manuel to strike mexico within a period the first such occurrence since 1958 ingrid was the ninth named storm and second hurricane of the 2013 atlantic hurricane season it formed on in the gulf of mexico from a broad disturbance that also spawned manuel in the eastern pacific after initially moving westward toward veracruz ingrid turned northeastward away from the coast favorable conditions allowed it to attain hurricane status on and the next day ingrid attained peak winds of subsequently increased wind shear weakened the convection as the storm turned more to the northwest and west on ingrid made landfall just south of la pesca tamaulipas in northeastern mexico as a strong tropical storm and dissipated the next day the hurricane was also the last one to form in the gulf of mexico until hurricane hermine in 2016 the combined impacts of hurricanes ingrid and manuel affected two thirds of mexico killing and causing mxn 75 billion or roughly us in damage most of the effects were due to manuel though ingrid was directly responsible for at least and mxn in damage the two storms precipitated 3 cu ft of water the equivalent of filling every dam in mexico rainfall from the storm peaked at in tuxpan veracruz the rains caused widespread flooding damaging at least 14,000 houses and hundreds of roads and bridges in tamaulipas where the storm made

meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the scale on a tropical wave exited the west coast of africa which moved westward across the atlantic ocean without development on an area of convection or thunderstorms developed along the northern portion of the wave but was eventually absorbed into tropical storm gabrielle north of puerto rico the wave continued westward through the caribbean sea into a large area of cyclonic flow at the surface which extended across central america into the eastern pacific around the broad system developed two areas of disturbed weather one in the eastern pacific would become hurricane manuel and the other developing over the northwestern caribbean the latter system slowly organized developing a low pressure area on subsequently the system moved over the peninsula 1 although land interaction prevented immediate development conditions favored further development in the bay of campeche 2 early on the low emerged into the bay and at 1800 utc the national hurricane center nhc assessed that tropical depression ten developed about east northeast of veracruz 1 this was confirmed by a hurricane hunters flight indicating the presence of a closed low level circulation 3 on september 13 convection and organization increased and the depression strengthened into tropical storm ingrid while weak steering currents resulted in little movement of the cyclone 4 partially due to the presence of nearby hurricane manuel in the eastern pacific basin on the other side of mexico significant wind shear existed in the vicinity of ingrid 5 nonetheless strong convection and intermittent development of an eye allowed for strengthening of the storm on september 14 6 ingrid strengthened into a hurricane the second of the season that afternoon 7 around that time the hurricane turned sharply northeastward due to a trough over eastern mexico and a ridge over the southeastern united states 1 additional strengthening took place thereafter and ingrid reached a peak intensity of early on september 15 while starting to move northward and begin a northwest turn towards the mexican coastline 8 afterward ingrid reached peak winds shear increased and began to weaken the hurricane as it approached the mexican coast 9 the center became displaced to the edge of the convection and nhc forecaster daniel brown noted that ingrid did not resemble a classic hurricane in satellite pictures 10 at around on ingrid made landfall just south of la pesca tamaulipas in northeastern mexico after having weakened into a strong tropical storm with winds 1 near landfall the hurricane hunters reported flight level winds of which after adjusting to surface winds confirmed the weakening 11 the storm moved ashore less than after tropical storm manuel struck the pacific coast of mexico on 12 making it the first time since 1958 that tropical cyclones struck both coasts of the country within one day 13 ingrid rapidly weakened into a tropical depression over land 14 and although convection temporarily reorganized 15 the circulation dissipated on 16 preparations and impact edit satellite image of developing tropical storms ingrid centered over bay of campeche and manuel located southwest of mexico several tropical cyclone warnings and watches were posted in anticipation of the storm upon the development of ingrid into a tropical cyclone at on the government of mexico issued a tropical storm warning from coatzacoalcos to nautla veracruz at on the tropical storm warning was extended northward to cabo

along the coast of veracruz while making landfall it also brought tropical storm force winds along the northeastern mexican coast sustained winds at la pesca peaked at with gusts to the nhc remarked that ingrid likely caused above normal tides in northeastern mexico but there was no data to back up the statement interacting with hurricane manuel on the pacific coast and the broad cyclonic flow ingrid dropped heavy rainfall across eastern mexico primarily in tabasco veracruz and tamaulipas states in tuxpan veracruz rainfall totaled over while at the presa vicente guerrero dam in tamaulipas precipitation reached 1 surface runoff from the storm spread to the pacific coast of mexico producing flooding in guerrero in combination with manuel the impacts from both storms produced 3 cu ft of
