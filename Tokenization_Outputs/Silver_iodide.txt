standard state at n verify what is y n silver iodide is an inorganic compound with the formula ag i the compound is a bright yellow solid but samples almost always contain impurities of metallic silver that give a gray coloration the silver contamination arises because agi is highly photosensitive this property is exploited in silver based photography silver iodide is also used as an antiseptic and in cloud seeding contents 1 structure 2 preparation and properties 3 cloud seeding 4 safety 5 references structure edit the structure adopted by silver iodide is temperature dependent 2 below the of agi with the wurtzite structure is most stable this phase is encountered in nature as the mineral iodargyrite above the becomes more stable this motif is a body centered cubic structure which has the silver centers distributed randomly between 6 octahedral 12 tetrahedral and 24 trigonal sites 3 at this temperature ag ions can move rapidly through the solid allowing fast ion conduction the transition between the and forms represents the melting of the silver cation sublattice the entropy of fusion for is approximately half that for sodium chloride a typical ionic solid this can be rationalized by considering the agi crystalline lattice to have already partly melted in the transition between and polymorphs a metastable also exists below with the zinc blende structure the golden yellow crystals on this mineral sample are iodargyrite a naturally occurring form of preparation and properties edit silver iodide is prepared by reaction of an iodide solution e g potassium iodide with a solution of silver ions e g silver nitrate a yellowish solid quickly precipitates the solid is a mixture of the two principal phases dissolution of the agi in hydroiodic acid followed by dilution with water precipitates alternatively dissolution of agi in a solution of concentrated silver nitrate followed by dilution affords 4 if the preparation is not conducted in the absence of sunlight the solid darkens rapidly the light causing the reduction of ionic silver to metallic the photosensitivity varies with sample purity cloud seeding edit cessna 210 equipped with a silver iodide generator for cloud seeding the crystalline structure of is similar to that of ice allowing it to induce freezing by the process known as heterogeneous nucleation approximately are used for cloud seeding annually each seeding experiment consuming 5 safety edit extreme exposure can lead to argyria characterized by localized discoloration of body tissue 6 references edit a b zumdahl
