date 4 december 1998 launch vehicle space shuttle endeavour docked 6 december 1998 mass 11,612 kilograms length 5.47 metres diameter 4.57 metres references 1 2 the unity module as seen in may 2011 the unity connecting module also known as node 1 was the first u s built component of the international space station it is cylindrical in shape with six berthing locations forward aft port starboard zenith and nadir facilitating connections to other modules unity measures 4.57 metres in diameter is 5.47 metres long and was built for nasa by boeing in a manufacturing facility at the marshall space flight center in huntsville alabama commonly known as node 1 unity was the first of the three connecting modules the other two are harmony and tranquility contents 1 launch and initial berthing 2 connecting modules and visiting vehicles 3 details 4 other nodes 5 footnotes 6 references launch and initial berthing edit unity was carried into orbit as the primary cargo of the space shuttle endeavour on sts 88 the first space shuttle mission dedicated to assembly of the station on december 6 1998 the sts 88 crew mated the aft berthing port of unity with the forward hatch of the already orbiting zarya module zarya was a mixed russian us funded and russian built component launched earlier aboard a russian proton rocket from baikonur kazakhstan this was the first connection made between two station modules connecting modules and visiting vehicles edit unity has 2 axial and 4 radial common berthing mechanism cbm ports in addition to connecting to the zarya module unity connects to the u s destiny laboratory module added on sts 98 the z1 truss an early exterior framework for the station added on sts 92 the pma 3 also added on sts 92 and the quest joint airlock added on sts 104 in addition the leonardo and raffaello multi purpose logistics modules were each berthed to unity on multiple missions during sts 120 the harmony connecting module was temporarily berthed to the port side hatch of unity tranquility with its multi windowed cupola was attached to unity s port side during the sts 130 mission and pmm leonardo was added to the nadir hatch during sts 133

interior of node 1 essential space station resources such as fluids environmental control and life support systems electrical and data systems are routed through unity to supply work and living areas of the station more than 50,000 mechanical items 216 lines to carry fluids and gases and 121 internal and external electrical cables using six miles of wire were installed in the unity node it is also made of aluminium and stainless steel during the space station construction a crew member placed 2 speed limit signs on the hatch leading into the fgb in 2003 noting the orbital velocity in mph and km h 3 prior to its launch aboard endeavour conical pressurized mating adapters pmas were attached to the aft and forward berthing mechanisms of unity unity and the two mating adapters together weighed about 25,600 pounds the adapters allow the docking systems used by the space shuttle and by russian modules to attach to the hatches and berthing mechanisms pma 1 now permanently attaches unity to zarya while pma 2 provided a shuttle docking port attached to the exterior of pma 1 are computers or multiplexer demultiplexers mdms which provided early command and control of unity unity also is outfitted with an early communications system that allows data voice and low data rate video with mission control houston to supplement russian communications systems during the early station assembly activities pma 3 was attached to nadir berthing mechanism by the crew of sts 92 other nodes edit node 3 tranquility in space the two remaining station connecting modules or nodes were built in italy by alenia aerospazio as part of an agreement between nasa and the european space agency esa harmony formerly known as node 2 and tranquility formerly known as node 3 are slightly longer than unity measuring almost 6.4 meters 21 feet long in total in addition to their six berthing ports each can hold eight international standard payload racks isprs unity in comparison holds just four isprs esa built nodes 2 and 3 as partial payment for the launch aboard the shuttle of the columbus laboratory module and other esa equipment footnotes edit nasa nssdc spacecraft details retrieved 8 november
