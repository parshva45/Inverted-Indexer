kibo iss module wikipedia kibo iss module from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search japanese experiment module the japanese experiment module jem nicknamed kibo hope is a japanese science module for the international space station iss developed by jaxa it is the largest single iss module the first two pieces of the module were launched on space shuttle missions sts 123 and sts 124 the third and final components were launched on sts 127 1 contents 1 components 1.1 pressurized module 1.2 exposed facility 1.3 experiment logistics module 1.4 remote manipulator system 2 launch

module the pressurized module pm is the core component connected to the port hatch of the node 2 module it is cylindrical in shape and contains twenty three international standard payload racks isprs ten of which are dedicated to science experiments while the remaining 13 are dedicated to systems and storage 3 the racks are placed 6-6-6-5 along the four walls of the module the end of the jem pm has an airlock and two window hatches the exposed facility experiment logistics module and the remote manipulator system all connect to the pressurized module kibo is also the location for many of the press conferences that take place on board the station exposed facility edit exposed facility the exposed facility ef also known as terrace is located outside the port cone of the pm which is equipped with an airlock the ef has 12 efu exposed facility unit ports that attach to piu payload interface unit connectors on ef eeus ef equipment exchange units all experiment payloads are fully exposed to the space environment for proper functioning of these experiments the payload requires an oru orbital replacement unit which consists of the eps electrical power system ct communications tracking and the tcs thermal control system of the 12 orus eight are replaceable by the jemrms while the other four are eva replaceable experiment logistics module edit experiment logistics module pressurized section the experiment logistics module elm includes two sections the japanese experiment logistics module pressurized section also called the is a pressurized addition to the pm the module is a storage facility that provides storage space for experiment payloads samples and spare items 4 the unpressurized external section elm es serves the ef as a storage and transportation module remote manipulator system edit the remote manipulator system jemrms is a 10m long robotic arm mounted at the port cone of the pm intended to service the ef and to move equipment from and to the elm the rms control console was launched while inside the elm ps the main arm was launched with the pm the small fine arm is 2m long and attaches to the end effector of the main arm was launched aboard 5 the free end of the jemrms is able to use the type of grapple fixtures that the canadarm2 uses 6 launch sequence edit the ef and elm es arrive at the kennedy space center left technicians work on the remote manipulator system at ksc right nasa launched the jem complex over three flights using the space shuttle the shuttle had a large payload bay which carried the modules into orbit along with the crew this is in contrast to the russian modules which are launched into orbit on multistage proton rockets and then rendezvous and dock with the station automatically on 12 march 2007 the experiment logistics module pressurized section elm ps the main laboratory arrived at the kennedy space center ksc from japan 7 it was stored in the space station processing facility until launched into orbit aboard space shuttle endeavour as part of the sts 123 mission 8 at first the elm ps the small cargo bay was connected to a temporary location on the harmony module node 2 and later on 6 june 2008 was moved to its final destination or berthing location on top zenith of the main laboratory on 30 may 2003 the pressurized module pm arrived at ksc from japan 9 it was stored at the space station processing facility until launched into orbit aboard space shuttle discovery as part of the sts 124 mission 10 on 3 june 2008 the pm was attached to the harmony module the ef and elm es arrived at ksc on 24 september 2008 11 the exposed facility ef and elm es were launched on sts 127 on 15 july 2009 12 the elm es was brought back to earth at the end of the mission the assembly of the ef was completed during the fifth spacewalk of the mission 13 specifications edit nasda era graphic is the largest single iss module pressurized module 14 length diameter mass experiment logistics module 15
