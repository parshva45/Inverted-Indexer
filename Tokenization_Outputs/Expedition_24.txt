module edit on 31 july 2010 the expedition 24 crew was awoken by an alarm on the station the alarm was caused by a cooling pump that had failed and caused a remote power controller to trip and cut power to some of the international space station iss astronauts tracy caldwell dyson and doug wheelock performed some steps to assist ground controllers in re powering some of the station components such as two main power buses and one control moment gyroscope after the steps had been completed capcomm james kelly told the crew they could go back to bed as all the work required by the crew on the iss was complete a short time later another alarm sounded and awoke the crew when the ground attempted to restart the pump module 3 docking ring edit a failure in the docking ring on the mini research module 2 mrm2 poisk caused a delay in the planned landing of the soyuz tma 18 spacecraft soyuz tma 18 was originally planned to undock and land on 24 september 2010 but instead undocked less than 24 hours later on 25 september 2010 the failure is believed to be due to a faulty indication from a micro switch on the hatch between the soyuz and mrm2 a drive gear which is related to the docking mechanism was also found to have two broken teeth and is believed to be related to the problem as well 4 spacewalks edit shannon walker is pictured near the robotic workstation in the destiny laboratory during the eva 2 on 7 august 2010 wheelock egresses the quest airlock hatch on the iss during the eva 3 on 11 august 2010 three spacewalks one in orlan space suits and two in u s extravehicular mobility units emus were originally planned for expedition 24 however additional spacewalking tasks were added to remove and replace a failed ammonia pump module mission spacewalkers

rassvet and the zvezda module routing them along the zarya module the pair then installed cables between rassvet and zarya they next moved on to relocate a camera already on exterior from the zenith or space facing side to the nadir or earth facing side as their final task yurchikhin and kornienko replaced a camera used for docking european automated transfer vehicles to the station expedition 24 eva 2 douglas wheelock tracy caldwell dyson 7 august 2010 11 19 7 august 2010 19 22 8 hours 3 minutes wheelock and caldwell dyson disconnected electrical and fluid connectors the spacewalkers did not complete all of the planned tasks due to a quick disconnect that got stuck and would not release the pair had to complete a bake out in order to ensure there was no ammonia on their suits before re entering the space station 5 expedition 24 eva 3 douglas wheelock tracy caldwell dyson 11 august 2010 12 27 11 august 2010 19 53 7 hours 26 minutes wheelock successfully closed the quick disconnect valve for the fourth and final fluid connector for the failed pump and detached the final fluid line from the failed pump caldwell dyson demated five electrical and data cables while wheelock broke torque and removed four bolts from the old pump the pump was extracted from the truss through the use of a grapple bar and installed on a payload bracket on the mobile base system on the truss caldwell dyson then prepared the spare pump for future installation disconnecting three of five electrical cables and reconfiguring insulation 6 7 expedition 24 eva 4 douglas wheelock tracy caldwell

after wheelock attached four bolts and caldwell dyson mated five electrical connectors 8 denotes spacewalks performed from the pirs docking compartment in russian orlan suits gallery edit the soyuz
