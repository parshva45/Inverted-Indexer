center reported that a tropical depression had developed within an area of disturbed weather that was located about to the southeast of the cape verde islands 1 during that day the depression gradually developed further as it moved westwards under the influence of the subtropical ridge of high pressure that was located to the north of the system before during the next day the nhc reported that the system had become a tropical storm and named it david becoming a hurricane on august 27 it moved west northwestward before entering a period of rapid intensification which brought it to an intensity of on august 28 slight fluctuations in intensity occurred before the hurricane ravaged the tiny windward island of dominica on the 29th 2 david continued west northwest and intensified into

in the days prior to hitting dominica david was originally expected to hit barbados and spare dominica in the process however on august 29 a turn in the hours before moving through the area caused the hurricane to make a direct hit on the southern part of dominica 5 even as it became increasingly clear that david was headed for the island residents did not appear to take the situation seriously this can be partly attributed to the fact that local radio warnings were minimal and disaster preparedness schemes were essentially non existent furthermore dominica had not experienced a major hurricane since 1930 thus leading to complacency amongst much of the population this proved to have disastrous consequences for the island nation 5 6 some evacuated in the united states in anticipation of david 2 including 300,000 in southeastern florida due to a predicted landfall between the florida keys and palm beach of those 78,000 fled to shelters while others either stayed at a

predictions had been more accurate the consequences would have been disastrous 7 one reporter who covered hurricane david was dick baumbach a journalist with today newspaper now known as florida today
