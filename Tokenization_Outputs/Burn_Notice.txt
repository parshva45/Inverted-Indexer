plot edit the title of the series refers to the burn notices issued by intelligence agencies to discredit or announce the dismissal of agents or sources who are considered to have become unreliable when spies are burned their connection to an espionage organization is terminated leaving them without access to cash or influence according to the narration during the opening credits the burned spy has no prior work history no money no support in essence no identity the television series uses second person narrative and frequent voice overs providing exposition from the viewpoint of covert operations agent michael westen played by jeffrey donovan the voice over commentary is in the form of tips for fledgling agents as if for a training or orientation film after being burnt in the middle of an operation in southern nigeria and being beaten and kidnapped to follow westen finds himself in his hometown 4 of miami florida he is tended to by his ex girlfriend fiona glenanne but he has been abandoned by all his normal intelligence contacts and is under continuous surveillance with his personal assets frozen extraordinary efforts to reach his u s government handler eventually yield only a grudging admission that someone powerful wants him on ice in miami if he leaves there he will be hunted down and taken into custody if he stays he can remain relatively free consumed by the desire to find out who burned him and why westen is reluctantly drawn into working as an unlicensed private investigator and problem solver for ordinary citizens to fund his personal investigation into his situation as a blacklisted agent westen invites his old friend sam axe to assist him while fiona invites herself to join them with the occasional assistance and sometimes hindrance of his mother madeline westen battles an array of criminals such as mobsters gang members con artists murderers rapists kidnappers foreign wet work operatives drug traffickers sex traffickers arms traffickers and war criminals at the same time michael must follow the trail that leads him to the people responsible for his being burned and later finding out why the series juggles these two narratives the overall series dealing with why michael was burned and individual episodes focusing on the cases he works for clients cast and characters edit main article list of burn notice characters the 2009 cast of burn

a bullet or holds an edge he has an uncanny ability to assume cover identities working in numerous regional dialects and international accents however he cannot speak spanish fluently he believes that

from her past and blend in showing her own ability to adapt she is both a complement to michael and his match in many ways both intellectually and tactically series creator matt nix has said about michael and relationship 5 the thing about the relationship with fiona is they are two people who really have anybody else they can be with anybody else is going to be afraid of what michael does and it sort of turns her on and anybody else for michael is going to be uninteresting he is attracted to her but part of what we explore over the first season is they really are attracted with each other
