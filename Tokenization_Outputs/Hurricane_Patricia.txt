mexico in patricia was first classified a tropical depression on initial development was slow with only modest strengthening within the first day of its classification the system later became a tropical storm and was named patricia the twenty fourth named storm of the annual hurricane season exceptionally favorable environmental conditions fueled explosive intensification on a well defined eye developed within an intense central dense overcast and patricia grew from a tropical storm to a hurricane in just near record pace on the hurricane achieved its record peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of nb 1 nb 2 this made it the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the western hemisphere and the strongest globally in terms of 1 minute maximum sustained winds late on dramatic weakening ensued and patricia made landfall near cuixmala jalisco with winds of this made it the strongest landfalling hurricane on record along the pacific coast of mexico patricia continued to weaken extremely quickly faster than it had intensified as it interacted with the mountainous terrain of mexico within of moving ashore patricia weakened into a tropical depression and dissipated soon

meteorological history edit main article meteorological history of hurricane patricia map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the scale on 2015 an area of disturbed weather traversed central america and emerged over the eastern pacific ocean the disturbance moved slowly over the next few days later merging with a tropical wave on the merger of these systems and the effects of a concurrent tehuantepec gap wind event spurred the formation of a broad area of low pressure this feature gradually consolidated and became a tropical depression shortly after 00 00 utc on at this time the depression was situated roughly south southeast of salina cruz mexico a mid level ridge to the north steered the depression generally west and later pulled it north along an arcing path 1 development was initially slowed by locally cooler sea surface temperatures and dry air and the depression became tropical storm patricia later that day 1 once clear of the unfavorable region patricia traversed anomalously warm waters within an environment exceptionally conducive to rapid intensification 1 2 dramatic strengthening began late on and continued through patricia reached hurricane strength shortly after on 1 featuring prominent outflow well defined banding features 3 and a developing eye 4 data from hurricane hunters investigating the cyclone indicated patricia to have reached status on the hurricane wind scale by 1 5 satellite animation of patricia making landfall on by the early hours of a clear northward turn took place followed by acceleration northeast 6 a solid ring of cloud tops surrounded the wide eye and signaled its intensification into a hurricane in a 24 hour time span maximum sustained winds increased by the fastest such intensification in any hurricane observed by the national hurricane center nhc the hurricane achieved its peak around on with estimated winds around and a barometric pressure of hpa these values are based upon continued intensification after a hurricane hunter mission into the storm six hours prior in the report on patricia it is noted that the hurricane may have surpassed typhoon tip as the strongest tropical cyclone ever observed but lack of direct observations at the time of its peak prevent analysis of such 1 later on rapid weakening ensued as an eyewall replacement cycle took shape and wind shear increased in the five hours up until landfall in mexico patricia weakened at an unprecedented rate while still over water however it remained a violent hurricane and moved ashore around near cuixmala jalisco with winds of and an analyzed pressure of hpa this made it the most intense pacific hurricane on record to strike mexico once onshore the high terrain of the sierra madre mountains accelerated weakening the low and mid level circulations of the tropical cyclone decoupled with the latter accelerating northeast and patricia dissipated on over central mexico less than after moving ashore 1 records edit see also meteorological history of hurricane patricia hurricane patricia set multiple records for maximum strength rate of intensification and rate of weakening throughout its relatively short existence with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum pressure of hpa patricia is the most intense tropical cyclone ever observed in the western hemisphere in terms of central pressure it is also the second most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded worldwide just shy of typhoon tip in 1979 which had a minimum pressure of hpa 1 one minute maximum sustained winds ranked as the highest ever reliably observed or estimated in a tropical cyclone surpassing typhoon haiyan of 2013 7 the magnitude of rapid intensification is among the fastest ever observed in a 24 hour period its maximum sustained winds increased from to a record increase of during the same period central pressure fell by hpa despite record over water weakening prior to striking mexico patricia became the most intense pacific hurricane to make landfall with a pressure of hpa 1 preparations edit president enrique nieto meets with cabinet members to discuss hurricane patricia on before hurricane patricia arrived the government of mexico issued multiple watches and warnings for coastal communities a hurricane watch was first raised at on encompassing areas of colima and jalisco a tropical storm watch also covered
