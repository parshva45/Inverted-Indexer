external stowage platform wikipedia external stowage platform from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search esp 3 framework external stowage platforms esps are key components of the international space station iss each platform is an external pallet that can hold spare parts also known as orbital replacement units orus for the space station as a platform it is not pressurized but does require electricity to power the heaters of some of the stored equipment orus are attached to the esp via flight releasable attachment mechanisms frams matching witness plates that mate the oru to the platform while esp 1 is unique in shape esp 2 and esp 3 were based on the deployable version of the integrated cargo carriers icc which were designed to transport unpressurized cargo inside the space cargo bay esp 1 was transported to the international space station on sts 102 esp 2 flew on mission sts 114 return to flight and esp 3 on mission sts 118 fram breakdown contents 1 locations and

underside multi plane view of esp 1 the first of the external stowage platforms called esp 1 was installed on the port side trunnion pin on the outer hull of the destiny laboratory module on march 13 2001 during the second eva of the sts 102 space shuttle mission 1 it is powered by the unity module and has two attach points to store orus esp 1 was carried into orbit on the underside of an integrated cargo carrier it is smaller than the other esps and elcs with dimensions approximately 0.46 m wide by 2.4 m long and is differently shaped esp 1 holds the following orus 2 fram 1 pump flow control system pfcs added by the sts 102 crew 3 fram 2 direct current switching unit dcsu added by sts 100 crew 4 esp 1 and hardware installation locations on the destiny during sts 102 esp 1 attached

with yoke esp 2 updated fram orus esp 2 was detached from its keel yoke assembly which remained in the orbiter and installed with the assistance of space shuttle robotic arm and two spacewalkers during the sts 114 mission 5 it is much larger than esp 1 with eight fram sites creating room for up to eight spare parts orus like esp 1 it is powered by the unity module however unlike esp 1 esp 2 is attached to the quest joint airlock using a specialized esp attachment device espad esp 2 and esp 3 are deployable versions of the integrated cargo carrier and have the same dimensions approximately 8.5 feet long and 14 feet wide the orus on esp 2 are fram 1 top side failed pump module pm 004 relocated here by the iss 41 us eva 27 crew in oct 2014 fram 2 top side direct current

stanchions were placed on the truss during evas pump module pm sn0004 initially installed on fram 1 during sts 121 9 was removed on august 17 2010 by the exp 24 crew and installed on s1 truss replacing the original failed pm sn0002 the failed unit had been temporarily stored on an oru site on the mbs then moved to esp 2 by the sts 133 crew 10 then returned to earth by the sts 135 crew july 13 2011 a failed control moment gyroscope was installed on fram 5 from august 13 2007 during sts 118 11 until february 13 2008 when it was returned by sts 122 12 espad mount used to secure esp 2 to

departing sts 133 crew esp 3 edit esp 3 launch configuration with yoke esp 3 oru locations iss exp 38 esp 3 was detached from its keel yoke assembly which remained in the orbiter and installed on the p3 truss at uccas 1 on august 14 2007 during the space shuttle sts 118 mission it has seven attachment sites for iss spare parts and assemblies called orbital replacement units orus the platform also has handrails and attachment points for tethers and foot restraints that astronauts can use while working with the orus on the esp 3 esp 3 as with esp 2 are deployable versions of the integrated cargo carrier and have the same dimensions approximately 8.5 feet long and 14 feet wide esp 3 has two grapple fixtures to aid deployment esp 3 was the first major station element to be installed completely by robotics using only the shuttle and robotic arms an external berthing camera system bcs and a photovoltaic radiator grapple fixture pvrgf astronauts robotically installed the platform onto the p3 truss segment during the sts 118 seventh day 13 on january 12 2010 the robotic arm was used again to move esp 3 from the p3 truss segment uccas 1 site it was grappled by the arm and then transferred down the backbone on the mobile transporter esp 3 was then attached to its new location on the lower part of s3 truss segment at the pas 3 site moving the storage platform cleared the way for express logistics carrier -3 to be installed during sts 134 the orus currently installed on esp 3 are fram 1 top side pitch roll joint launched on esp 3 11 fram 2 top side flex hose rotary coupler fhrc sn1004
