express logistics carrier wikipedia express logistics carrier from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search an express logistics carrier elc is an unpressurized attached payload platform for the international space station iss that provides mechanical mounting surfaces electrical power and command and data handling services for orbital replacement units orus as well as science experiments on the iss express stands for expedite the processing of experiments to the space station the elcs were developed primarily at the goddard space flight center in greenbelt maryland with support from jsc ksc and msfc elc was formerly called express pallet and is the unpressurized counterpart to the pressurized express rack an elc provides scientists with a platform and infrastructure to deploy experiments in the vacuum of space without requiring a separate dedicated earth orbiting satellite elcs interface directly with the iss integrated truss common attach system cas 1 the p3 truss has two such attach points called unpressurised cargo carrier attachment system uccas mechanisms one facing zenith space facing called uccas 1 the other facing nadir earth facing called uccas 2 whereas the s3 truss has four similar locations called payload attachment system pas mechanisms two facing zenith pas 1 and pas 2 and two facing nadir pas 3 and pas 4 contents 1

layout and structure of the elc elc during final fabrication at gsfc the elc is an un pressurized attached payload project for the international space station iss that provides mechanical mounting surfaces electrical power and command and data handling services for science experiments on the iss express stands for the processing of experiments to the space the elcs have a deck size of about 14 feet by 16 feet and spans the width of the space payload bay each one is capable of providing scientists with a platform and infrastructure to deploy experiments in the vacuum of space without requiring a separate dedicated earth orbiting satellite each carrier is capable of carrying to orbit and will also serve as parking fixtures for spare iss hardware orus which can be retrieved when needed 2 experiments are mounted on express payload adapters expa which are about the same size as the frams that hold orus electrical subsystem express carrier avionics expca edit within the electrical subsystem of the elc the express carrier avionics expca provides electrical power distribution to experiments and data interfaces to the iss within the expca the coldfire based flight computer software and related electronics comprise its flight controller unit fcu the fcu runs the free open source real time operating system rtos rtems and provides the computing and communication resources as an elc command and data handling c dh system with the following major goals provide a low rate data link lrdl interface to iss to accept commands for the elc and the resident experiments the expca is implemented as a remote terminal rt on the mil std 1553 iss local bus this interface also returns housekeeping telemetry from the expca and resident experiments to the iss provide an lrdl from the expca to the experiments resident on the elc to forward commands from the iss to the experiments and to receive telemetry from the experiments for transmission to the iss this is another mil std 1553 interface with the expca acting as the bus controller bc provide a high rate data link hrdl between the elc and the iss this interface is implemented as a fiber optical data bus with a capacity of up to 95.0 megabits per second mbit s the primary function of this interface is the return on high volume experiment science data from the resident experiments to the iss provide an ethernet local area network lan between the elc and the resident experiments up to 6.0 mbit s per experiment the primary function of this interface is the return of science experiment data from to the iss relayed through the hrdl support six analog input channels at each expa express payload adapter location support six discrete command channels at each expa location manifested on elc 2 was the
