characters mr peabody and sherman in the rocky and bullwinkle show an animated cartoon 9 10 in one of the animated component segments improbable history the characters routinely used the machine to witness participate in and more often than not alter famous events in history citation needed technical details edit software has been developed to crawl the web and download all publicly accessible world wide web pages the gopher hierarchy the netnews usenet bulletin board system and downloadable software 11 the information collected by these crawlers does not include all the information available on the internet since much of the data is restricted by the publisher or stored in databases that are not accessible to overcome inconsistencies in partially cached websites archive it org was developed in 2005 by the internet archive as a means of allowing institutions and content creators to voluntarily harvest and preserve collections of digital content and create digital archives 12 crawl are contributed from various sources some imported from third parties and others generated internally by the archive 6 for example crawls are contributed by the sloan foundation and alexa crawls run by ia on behalf of nara and the internet memory foundation mirrors of common crawl 6 the worldwide web crawls have been running since 2010 and capture the global web 13 6 the frequency of snapshot captures varies per website 6 websites in the worldwide web crawls are included in a crawl list with the site archived once per crawl 6 a crawl can take months or even years to complete depending on size 6 for example wide crawl number 13 started on january 9 2015 and completed on july 11 2016 14 however there may be multiple crawls ongoing at any one time and a site might be included in more than one crawl list so how often a site is crawled varies widely 6 storage capabilities edit as of 2009 update the wayback machine contained approximately three petabytes of data and was growing at a rate of 100 terabytes each month 15 the growth rate reported in 2003 was 12 terabytes month the data is stored on petabox rack systems manufactured by capricorn technologies 16 in 2009 the internet

of the wayback machine with an updated interface and fresher index of archived content was made available for public testing 18 in march 2011 it was said on the wayback machine forum that the beta of the new wayback machine has a more complete and up to date index of all crawled materials into 2010 and will continue to be updated regularly the index driving the classic wayback machine only has a little bit of material past 2008 and no further index updates are planned as it will be phased out this year 19 in january 2013 the company announced a ground breaking milestone of 240 billion urls 20 in october 2013 the company announced the save a page feature 21 which allows any internet user to archive the contents of a url this became a threat of abuse by the service for hosting malicious

txt in determining if a website would be crawled or not or if already crawled if its archives would be publicly viewable website owners had the option to opt out of wayback machine through the use of robots txt it applied robots txt rules retroactively if a site blocked the internet archive any previously archived pages from the domain were immediately rendered unavailable as well in addition the internet archive stated sometimes a website owner will contact us directly and ask us to stop crawling or archiving a site we comply with these requests 39 in addition the website says the internet archive is not interested in preserving or offering access to web sites or other internet documents of persons who do not want their materials in the collection 40 oakland archive policy edit retroactive exclusion policy is based in part upon recommendations for managing removal requests and preserving archival integrity published by the school of information management and systems at university of california berkeley in 2002 which gives a website owner the right block access to the archives 41 wayback has complied with this policy to help avoid expensive litigation 42 the wayback retroactive exclusion policy began to relax in 2017 when it stopped honoring robots txt on u s government and military web sites for both crawling and displaying web pages as of april 2017 wayback is

litigation edit netbula llc v chordiant software inc edit in a 2009 case netbula llc v chordiant software inc defendant chordiant filed a motion to compel netbula to disable the robots txt file on its website that was causing the wayback machine to retroactively remove access to previous versions of pages it had archived from site pages that chordiant believed would support its case 52 netbula objected to the motion on the ground that defendants were asking to alter website and that they should have subpoenaed internet archive for the pages directly 53 an employee of internet archive filed a sworn statement supporting motion however stating that it could not produce the web pages by any other means without considerable burden expense and disruption to its operations 52 magistrate judge howard lloyd in the northern district of california san jose division rejected arguments and ordered them to disable the robots txt blockage temporarily in order to allow chordiant to retrieve the

evidence at trial 54 55 at the trial however district court judge ronald guzman the trial judge overruled magistrate keys findings citation needed and held that neither the affidavit of the internet archive employee nor the underlying pages i e the telewizja polska website were admissible as evidence judge guzman reasoned that the affidavit contained both hearsay and inconclusive supporting

met e g providing an authoritative statement of the archivist the united states patent office and the european patent office will accept date stamps from the internet archive as evidence of when a given web page was accessible to the public these dates are used to determine if a web page is available as prior art for instance in examining a patent application 56 limitations of utility edit there are technical limitations to archiving a website and as a consequence it is possible for opposing parties in litigation to misuse the results provided by website archives this problem can be exacerbated by the practice of submitting screen shots of web pages in complaints answers or expert witness reports when the underlying links are not exposed and therefore can contain errors for example archives such as the wayback machine do not fill out forms and therefore do not include the contents of non restful e commerce databases in their archives 57 legal status edit in europe the wayback machine could be interpreted as violating copyright laws only the content creator can decide where their content is published or duplicated so the archive would have to delete pages from its system upon request of the creator 58 the exclusion policies for the wayback machine may be found in the faq section of the site 59 archived content legal issues edit a number of cases have been

computer fraud and abuse act healthcare advocates claimed that since they had installed a robots txt file on their website even if after the initial lawsuit was filed the archive should have removed
