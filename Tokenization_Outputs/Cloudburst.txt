an extreme amount of precipitation in a short period of time 1 sometimes accompanied by hail and thunder that is capable of creating flood conditions a cloudburst can suddenly dump large amounts of water e g of precipitation corresponds to 25000 metric tons km 2 1 inch corresponds to tons over one square mile however cloudbursts are infrequent as they occur only via orographic lift or occasionally when a warm air parcel mixes with cooler air resulting in sudden condensation at times a large amount of runoff from higher elevations is mistakenly conflated with a cloudburst the term

solid body like a mountain they can also occur when hot water vapor mingles into the cold resulting in sudden condensation record cloudbursts edit duration rainfall location date 1 minute 1.5 inches
