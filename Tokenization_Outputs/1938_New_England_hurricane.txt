island and massachusetts southwestern quebec part of the 1938 atlantic hurricane season the 1938 new england hurricane also referred to as the great new england hurricane and long island express was one of the deadliest and most destructive tropical cyclones to strike long island new york and new england the storm formed near the coast of africa on becoming a hurricane on the saffir simpson hurricane scale before making landfall as a hurricane 1 on long island on it is estimated that the hurricane killed 682 people 2 damaged or destroyed more than 57,000 homes and caused property losses estimated at in 2017 3 damaged trees and buildings were still seen in the affected areas as late as 1951 4 it remains the most powerful and deadliest hurricane in recorded new england history eclipsed

bibliography 8 external links meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the scale the storm was first analyzed by ship data south of the cape verde islands on over the next ten days it steadily gathered strength and slowly tracked to the west northwest it is estimated to have reached intensity by while centered east of the bahamas it then veered northward in response to a deep trough over appalachia sparing the bahamas florida the carolinas and the mid atlantic states at the same time a high pressure system was centered north of bermuda preventing the hurricane from making an eastward turn out to sea 6 thus the hurricane was effectively squeezed to the north between the two weather systems this caused the forward speed to increase substantially late on ultimately reaching the highest forward velocity ever recorded in the annals of hurricanes this extreme forward motion was in the same general direction as the winds on the eastern side of the storm as it proceeded north this in turn caused the wind speed to be far higher in areas east of the eye than would be the case with a hurricane of more typical forward speed 7 the storm was centered several hundred miles to the southeast of cape hatteras during the early hours of and it weakened slightly by edt it was centered approximately 100 miles due east of cape hatteras and its forward speed had increased to well over this rapid movement did not permit enough time for the storm to weaken over the cooler waters before it reached long island 8 the hurricane sped through the virginia tidewater during the hour between and the new jersey coastline and new york city caught the western edge 9 at the same time weather conditions began to deteriorate rapidly on long island and along the southern new england coast the hurricane made landfall at bellport on long suffolk county sometime between and as a hurricane with sustained winds of 10 it made a second landfall as a hurricane somewhere between bridgeport and new haven connecticut at around with sustained winds of 10 the eye moved into western massachusetts by and it reached vermont by both westfield massachusetts and dorset vermont reported calm conditions and partial clearing during passage of the eye which is a rather unusual occurrence for a new england hurricane 11 the hurricane began to lose tropical characteristics as it continued into northern vermont though it was still carrying hurricane force winds it crossed into quebec at approximately transitioning into a post tropical low the post tropical remnants dissipated over northern ontario a few days later forecasting the storm edit in 1938 united states forecasting lagged behind forecasting in europe where new techniques were being used to analyze air masses taking into account the influence of fronts a confidential report was released by the united states forest service the parent agency of the united states weather bureau it described the weather forecasting as a sorry state of affairs where forecasters had poor training and systematic planning was not used and where forecasters had to scrape by to get information wherever they could the jacksonville florida office of the weather bureau issued a warning on september 19 that a hurricane might hit florida residents and authorities made extensive preparations as they had endured the labor day hurricane three years earlier when the storm turned north the office issued warnings for the carolina coast and transferred authority to the headquarters in washington at 9 00 am on september 21 the washington office issued northeast storm warnings north of atlantic city and south of block island rhode island and southeast storm warnings from block island to eastport maine 12 the advisory however underestimated the intensity and said that it was farther south than it actually was 12 the office had yet to forward any information about the hurricane to the new york city office 12 at 10 00 am the bureau downgraded the hurricane to a tropical storm the 11 30 am advisory mentioned gale force winds but nothing about a tropical storm or hurricane 12 that day 28 year old rookie charles pierce was standing in for two veteran meteorologists he concluded that the storm would be squeezed between a high pressure area located to the west and a high pressure area to the east and that it would be forced to ride up a trough of low pressure into new england a noon meeting was called and pierce presented his conclusion but he was overruled by celebrated chief forecaster charles mitchell and his senior staff in boston meteorologist e b rideout told his weei radio listeners to the skepticism of his peers that the hurricane would hit new england 13 at 2 00 pm hurricane force gusts were occurring on long south shore and near hurricane force gusts on the coast of connecticut the washington office issued an advisory saying that the storm was 75 miles east southeast of atlantic city and would pass over long island and connecticut re analysis of the storm suggests that the hurricane was farther north just 50 miles from fire island and that it was stronger and larger than the advisory said 12 impact edit a postcard view of flooding from the hurricane at buzzards bay station the majority of the storm damage was from storm surge and wind damage was estimated at the equivalent of adjusted for inflation in 2016 dollars making it among the most costly hurricanes to strike the u s mainland 14 it is estimated that if an identical hurricane had struck in 2005 it would have caused in damage due to changes in population and infrastructure 15 approximately 600 people died in the storm in new england most in rhode island and up to 100 people elsewhere in the path of the storm 16 an additional 708 people were reported injured 17 in total 4,500 cottages farms and other homes were reported destroyed and 25,000 homes were damaged other damages included 26,000 automobiles destroyed and 20,000 electrical poles toppled the hurricane also devastated the forests of the northeast knocking down an estimated two billion trees in new york and new england 17 freshwater flooding was minimal however as the quick passage of the storm decreased local rainfall totals with only a few small areas receiving over 10 inches 250 mm over 35% of new total forest area was affected in all over board feet of trees fell because of the storm although board feet of the trees were salvaged 18 the northeastern timber salvage administration netsa was established to deal with the extreme fire hazard that the fallen timber had created 19 in many locations roads from the fallen tree removal were visible decades later and some became trails still used today the new york new haven and hartford railroad from new haven to providence was particularly hard hit as countless bridges along the shore line were destroyed or flooded severing rail connections to badly affected cities such as westerly rhode island due to the lack of technology back in 1938 long island residents were not warned of the arrival 20 leaving no time to prepare or evacuate 21 long island was struck first before new england and quebec earning the storm the nickname the long island express 21 the winds reached up to with waves surging to around feet high 22 yale and harvard both owned large forests managed by their forestry departments but both forests were wiped out by the hurricane however yale had a backup forest at great mountain in northwestern connecticut which was spared from the totality of the damages and they were able to keep their forestry program running which maintains operation today program however was reduced as a result 23 new jersey edit the western side of the hurricane caused sustained tropical storm force winds high waves and storm surge along much of the new jersey coast 9 the surge destroyed much of the boardwalk in atlantic city and the bridge collapsed between atlantic city and brigantine stranding at least 2,000 additionally the surge inundated several coastal communities wildwood was under 3 feet of water at the height of the storm and the boardwalk was destroyed in bay head and dozens of cottages washed into the ocean crops sustained wind damage 24 the maximum recorded wind gust was at sandy hook 9 new york city and western long island edit the metropolitan area escaped the worst of the wind and storm surge because it was hit by the weaker western side winds were recorded at at central park battery park recorded sustained winds of with gusts to and a gust of was recorded above ground at the daily news building winds were estimated at on top of the empire state building 10 the highest winds were from the north to northwest on the back side of the storm 25 the storm surge was feet at the battery and the mean low water storm tide was feet at willets point 10 in new york harbor the waters rose in a half hour 10 in new york city and long island schools were dismissed early 12 26 extensive street flooding occurred because debris blocked drains 12 the east river flowed three blocks and flooded a consolidated edison con ed plant at 133rd street causing power to fail in manhattan north of 59th street and in the bronx for several minutes to a few hours railroad and ferry services were suspended for a time the staten island ferry boat knickerbocker got stuck in the terminal with 200 passengers aboard 12 25 bridges and tunnels into manhattan were closed until the following afternoon 95% of nassau county lost power where floods brought traffic to a halt 25 in manhasset bay almost 400 boats were ripped from their moorings and smashed or sunk with more than 100 washing up on the beach by the port washington yacht club similar scenes occurred in other locations on the north shore the j p morgan estate in glen cove was heavily damaged the wife of new york city mayor fiorello la guardia was forced to wait out the storm on the second floor of their northport cottage mitchel field army airfield was buffeted by winds of nearly and was under knee deep water 27 in williston park residents of 50 homes needed to be rescued by rowboat when heavy rain the previous few days combined with the rain from the hurricane to overflow a pond 2 26 28 29 30 31 eastern long island edit eastern long island experienced the worst of the storm the dune road area of westhampton beach was obliterated resulting in 29 deaths there were 21 other deaths through the rest of the east end of long island the storm surge temporarily turned montauk into an island as it flooded across the south fork at napeague and obliterated the tracks of the long island rail road long island was hit hard being exposed to the storm due to its shorelines the estimated storm tide was 15 feet in this region a mean low water storm tide of 8 feet was recorded at port jefferson 10 about 50 people perished in the wake 20 all the shore lines were very vulnerable to the high winds and flooding and anyone near the shores was directly in way ten new inlets were created on eastern long island 10 the surge rearranged the sand at the cedar point lighthouse so that the island became connected to what is now cedar point county park the surging water created the shinnecock inlet by carving out a large section of barrier island separating shinnecock bay from the atlantic the storm toppled the landmark steeple of the old church 32 which was the tallest building in sag harbor the steeple has not been rebuilt wading river suffered substantial damage the storm blew down the movie theater on front street in greenport on the north fork of long island the fishing industry was destroyed as was half of the apple crop 10 rhode island edit damage in island park rhode island water levels of the 1815 and 1938 hurricanes are marked at old market house providence the storm surge hit westerly rhode island at 3 50 pm resulting in 100 deaths 33 the tide was higher than usual because of the autumnal equinox and full moon and the hurricane produced storm tides of 14 to 18 feet along most of the connecticut coast with 18 to 25 foot tides from new london east to cape cod the entire coastline of rhode island the storm surge was especially violent along the rhode island shore sweeping hundreds of summer cottages out to sea low lying block island was almost completely underwater and many drowned as the surge drove northward through narragansett bay it was restricted by the funnel shape and rose to 15.8 feet above normal spring tides resulting in more than 13 feet of water in some areas of downtown providence several motorists were drowned in their automobiles 34 in jamestown seven children were killed when their school bus was blown into mackerel cove 35 many stores in downtown providence were looted by mobs often before the flood waters had fully subsided and due in part to the economic difficulties of the great depression many homes and structures were destroyed along the coast as well as many structures inland along the path entire beach communities were obliterated on the coast of rhode island napatree point was completely swept away a small cape that housed nearly 40 families between the atlantic ocean and little narragansett bay just off of watch hill today napatree is a wildlife refuge with no human inhabitants one house in charlestown rhode island was lifted and deposited across the street where it stood until it was demolished in august 2011 even to this day concrete staircases and boardwalk bases destroyed by the hurricane can be found when sand levels are low on some beaches the boardwalk along beach in newport was completely destroyed by the storm 35 a few miles from conanicut island whale rock light was swept off its base and into the raging waves killing lighthouse keeper walter eberle his body was never found the prudence island light suffered a direct blow from the storm surge which measured 17 feet 5 inches at sandy point the masonry tower was slightly damaged however the adjoining light home was utterly destroyed and washed out to sea the light wife and son were both killed as well as the former light keeper and a couple who left their summer cottages near the lighthouse and sought shelter in what they thought was the sturdier light home light keeper george t gustavus was thrown free from the wreckage of the house and was saved by an island resident who held a branch into the water from the cliffs farther down the coast gustavus and milton chase the owner of the power plant reactivated the light during the storm by running a cable from the plant to the light and installing a light bulb marking the first time that it was illuminated with electricity 36 the original parchment of the 1764 charter of brown university was washed clean of its text when its vault was flooded in a providence bank 37 newport recorded the highest water level of the storm at 3.53 meters above mean sea level according to a noaa study 38 this storm level is 0.98 meters above the slosh model of a 100 year storm and one estimate is that this water level reflects a storm occurring roughly once every 400 years 39 a study of sand deposits also gives evidence that this was the strongest hurricane to hit rhode island in over 300 years 38 39 the fox point hurricane barrier was completed in 1966 because of the massive flooding from the 1938 storm and from the even higher 14.4 foot 4.4 meters storm surge that resulted from hurricane carol in hopes of preventing extreme storm surges from ever again flooding downtown providence 40 connecticut edit flooding in bushnell park in hartford connecticut in the aftermath of the hurricane the travelers insurance co building appears in the back tobacco barn in connecticut 1938 by sheldon dick eastern connecticut was on the eastern side of the hurricane long island acted as a buffer against large ocean surges but the waters of long island sound rose to great heights small shoreline towns to the east of new haven experienced much destruction from the water and winds and the 1938 hurricane holds the record for the worst natural disaster in 350 year history the mean low water storm tide was 14.1 feet at stamford 12.8 feet at bridgeport and 10.58 feet at new london which remains a record high 10 in the shoreline towns of madison clinton westbrook and old saybrook buildings were found as wreckage across coastal roads actress katharine hepburn waded to safety from her old

drawers and cabinets while searching for survivors in the homes in mystic new london was first swept by the winds and storm surge after which the waterfront business district caught fire and burned out of control for 10 hours stately homes along ocean beach were leveled by the storm surge the permanently anchored 240 ton lightship at the head of new london harbor was found on a sand bar two miles away interior sections of the state experienced widespread flooding as the torrential rains fell on soil already saturated from previous storms the connecticut river was forced out of its banks inundating cities and towns from hartford to middletown novelist ann petry drew on her personal experiences of the hurricane in old saybrook in her 1947 novel country place the novel is set in the immediate aftermath of world war ii but petry identified the 1938 storm as the source for the storm that is at the center of her narrative citation needed massachusetts edit aerial photo of marchmont in winchendon springs massachusetts taken during the summer of 1938 devastated landscape around marchmont on september 23 1938 the eye of the storm followed the connecticut river north into massachusetts where the winds and flooding killed 99 people in springfield the river rose six to 10 feet above flood stage causing significant damage up to six inches of rain fell across western massachusetts which combined with over four inches that had fallen a few days earlier to produce widespread flooding flash flooding on the chicopee river washed away the chicopee falls bridge while the connecticut river flooded most of the willimansett section residents of ware were stranded for days and relied on air dropped food and medicine after the flood receded the main street was a chasm in which sewer pipes could be seen to the east the surge left falmouth and new bedford under eight feet of water two thirds of the boats sank in new bedford harbor several homes washed away on atlantic boulevard in fall river whose foundations can still be found on the beach today the blue hill observatory registered sustained winds of and a peak gust of which is the strongest hurricane related surface wind gust ever recorded in the united states 42 a 50 foot wave the tallest of the storm was recorded at gloucester 10 vermont edit the storm entered vermont as a category 1 hurricane

only one known to have struck vermont as a hurricane new hampshire edit damage done to pine forests in wolfeboro new hampshire 1938 by peter roome even though the storm center tracked further west through vermont new hampshire received appreciable damage as in vermont very high winds brought down numerous trees and electric lines but rainfall totals in new hampshire were significantly less than those in other states only 1 inch of rain fell in concord citation needed damage at peterborough was worse however total damage there was stated to be $500,000 in 2005 which included the destruction of much of the lower downtown burned because floodwaters prevented firefighters from reaching and extinguishing the blaze other communities also suffered considerable damage to forest resources in new hampshire perished at mt washington winds gusted to 163 miles per hour and knocked down part of a trestle on the cog railway 29 maine edit in maine buildings and trees were damaged and power outages occurred storm surge was minimal and winds remained below hurricane strength the storm did not claim any lives in maine 29 45 maryland and delaware edit the western periphery of the hurricane brought heavy rain and gusty winds to delaware and southeastern maryland 46 damage if any is believed to have been minimal quebec edit as the hurricane was transitioning into an extratropical cyclone it tracked into southern quebec by the time the system initially crossed into canada it continued to produce heavy rain and very strong winds but interaction with land had taken its toll nevertheless the hurricane managed to blow down numerous trees throughout the region 47 otherwise damage was generally minimal 48 see also edit tropical cyclones portal list of atlantic hurricanes list of category 5

the forward motion increases the observed wind speed for points to the right of the eye of the hurricane and decreases the observed wind speed for points to the left of the eye this occurs in a
