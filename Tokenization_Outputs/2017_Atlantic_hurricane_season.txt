cyclone season atlantic hurricane seasons 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 the 2017 atlantic hurricane season is an ongoing event in the annual formation of tropical cyclones in the atlantic basin the season has been hyperactive 1 featuring 17 named storms making it tied with 1936 as the fifth most active season since reliable records began in 1851 and featuring both the highest total accumulated cyclone energy ace and the highest number of major hurricanes since the 2005 season it has the greatest number of consecutive hurricanes in the satellite era with franklin through ophelia all reaching winds of at least in addition it is most destructive season on record with a preliminary total of over $316.51 billion usd in damages nearly all of which was due to three of the major hurricanes of the season harvey irma and maria this season is also one of only six years on record to feature multiple hurricanes landfalls on multiple caribbean islands and landfall on dominica make 2017 the second season on record after 2007 to feature two hurricanes making landfall at intensity in addition irma was the strongest hurricane ever recorded to form in the atlantic ocean outside of the gulf of mexico and caribbean sea 2 this season is the only season on record in which three hurricanes each had an ace of over 40 irma jose and maria the season officially began on and will end on these dates historically describe the period of year when most tropical cyclones form in the atlantic basin and are adopted by convention however as shown by tropical storm arlene in april the formation of tropical cyclones is possible at other times of the year arlene also marked 2017 the third consecutive year to feature a pre season storm in mid june tropical storm bret struck the island of trinidad which is only rarely struck by tropical cyclones due to its low latitude a few days later tropical storm cindy struck the state of louisiana in late august hurricane harvey became the first major hurricane to make landfall in the united states since wilma in 2005 while also setting the record for the costliest tropical cyclone on record as well as the most rainfall dropped by a tropical cyclone in the us in early september hurricane irma a cape verde type hurricane became the first category to impact the northern leeward islands on record as well as equaling the strongest hurricane ever to make landfall in the atlantic 1935 labor day hurricane with hurricane maria striking puerto rico as a high end the season was the first on record to feature three atlantic hurricanes making landfall anywhere in the united states or one of its territories at intensity or stronger the season also featured the fastest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the gulf of mexico nate this was the first season to have three hurricanes make landfall in the mainland united states harvey irma and nate since 2008 and the first season to feature four hurricanes making landfall in the overall united states harvey irma maria and nate since 2005 the season also featured ophelia the easternmost major hurricane in the basin on record which later became the costliest hurricane to affect the united kingdom and ireland in history for the first time since 2013 a named storm formed in every month of the season june to november beginning in 2017 the national hurricane center nhc has the option to issue advisories and thus allow watches and warnings to be issued on disturbances that are not yet tropical cyclones but have a high chance to become one and are expected to bring tropical storm or hurricane conditions to landmasses within such systems are termed potential tropical cyclones advisories on these storms contain the same content including track forecasts and cyclone watches and warnings as advisories on active tropical cyclones 3 the first storm to receive this designation was potential tropical cyclone two which later developed into tropical storm bret east southeast of the windward islands on 4 in addition the numbering that a potential tropical cyclone receives would be retained for the rest of the hurricane season meaning that the next tropical system would be designated with the following number even though potential tropical cyclones do not qualify as tropical cyclones this was first demonstrated with potential tropical cyclone ten which failed to develop into a tropical cyclone contents 1 seasonal forecasts 1.1 pre season outlooks 1.2 mid season outlooks 2 seasonal summary 3 systems 3.1 tropical storm arlene 3.2 tropical storm bret 3.3 tropical storm

national meteorological services and scientific agencies forecast how many named storms hurricanes and major or higher on the scale hurricanes will form during a season and or how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country these agencies include the tropical storm risk tsr consortium of the university college london the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and colorado state university csu the forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms hurricanes and major hurricanes within a particular year 6 some of these forecasts also take into consideration what happened in previous seasons and the dissipation of the el event on average an atlantic hurricane season between 1981 and 2010 contained twelve tropical storms six hurricanes and two major hurricanes with an accumulated cyclone energy ace index of between 66 and 5 pre season outlooks edit the first forecast for the year was issued by tsr on december 13 2016 6 they anticipated that the 2017 season would be a near average season with a prediction of 14 named storms 6 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes they also predicted an ace index of around 6 on december 14 csu released a qualitative discussion detailing five possible scenarios for the 2017 season taking into account the state of the atlantic multidecadal oscillation and the possibility of el developing during the season 21 tsr lowered their forecast numbers on april 5 2017 to 11 named storms 4 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes based on recent trends favoring the development of el 7 the next day csu released their prediction also predicting a total of 11 named storms 4 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes 8 on april 17 the weather company released their forecasts calling for 2017 to be a near average season with a total of 12 named storms 6 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes 9 the next day on april 18 north carolina state university released their prediction also predicting a near average season with a total of named storms hurricanes and major hurricanes 10 on may 20 the weather company issued an updated forecast raising their numbers to 14 named storms 7 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes to account for tropical storm arlene as well as the decreasing chance of el forming during the season 11 on may 25 noaa released their prediction citing a 70% chance of an above average season due to a weak or nonexistent el calling for named storms hurricanes and major hurricanes 12 on may 26 tsr updated its prediction to around the same numbers as its december 2016 prediction with only a minor change in the expected ace index amount to 13 mid season outlooks edit csu updated their forecast on june 1 to include 14 named storms 6 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes to include tropical storm arlene 14 it was based on the current status of the north atlantic oscillation which was showing signs of leaning towards a negative phase favoring a warmer tropical atlantic and the chances of el forming were significantly lower however they stressed on the uncertainty that the el oscillation could be in a warm neutral phase or weak el conditions by the peak of the season 14 on the same day the united kingdom met office ukmo released its forecast of a very slightly above average season it predicted 13 named storms with a 70% chance that the number would be in the range between 10 and 16 and 8 hurricanes with a 70% chance that the number would be in the range between 6 and 10 it also predicted an ace index of 145 with a 70% chance that the index would be between 92 and 198 15 on july 4 tsr released their fourth forecast for the season increasing their predicted numbers to 17 named storms 7 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes due to the fact that el conditions would no longer develop by the peak of the season and the warming of sea surface temperatures across the basin additionally they predicted a revised ace index of 16 during august 9 noaa released their final outlook for the season raising their predictions to named storms though retaining hurricanes and major hurricanes they also stated that the season had the potential to be extremely active possibly the most active since 2010 20 seasonal summary edit main article timeline of the 2017 atlantic hurricane season three simultaneous hurricanes active on september 8 with katia left irma center and jose right all three were threatening land at the time the atlantic hurricane season officially began on june 1 2017 although activity began earlier for the third consecutive year since 2015 roughly a month before the official start the first storm arlene developed on april 19 in the northern atlantic ocean it was the first named storm to develop in the month of april since ana in 2003 in june two more tropical storms developed bret which affected areas in the southeastern caribbean sea including trinidad and tobago and cindy which formed in the gulf of mexico less than a day after bret had developed in july a tropical depression developed in the main development region mdr the second tropical cyclone to develop in the mdr before the month of august after bret and was followed by tropical storm don at the end of that month a cold front stalled over the gulf of mexico and portions of the southeastern united states spawning tropical depression six which quickly developed into tropical storm emily 22 august featured the first hurricane franklin which formed in the bay of campeche a few days after franklin dissipated tropical storm gert formed northeast of the bahamas eventually becoming a hurricane at a high latitude over the western atlantic on august 17 tropical storm harvey formed east of the windward islands before opening up into a wave over the central caribbean three days later harvey then regenerated into a tropical depression over the southwestern gulf of mexico on august 23 and rapidly strengthened into a hurricane before making landfall near rockport texas late on august 25 harvey became the first major hurricane to make landfall in the united states since wilma in 2005 the first hurricane to make landfall in texas since carla in 1961 and the first hurricane landfall in the contiguous united states since charley in 2004 22 most intense atlantic hurricane seasons since 1850 nb 1 rank season ace

from to september featured copious activity irma formed in the eastern atlantic and rapidly intensified into a hurricane east of the leeward islands irma is the strongest hurricane in terms of sustained winds since wilma in 2005 and the strongest hurricane outside of the caribbean sea and gulf of mexico on record while irma impacted the northern leeward islands hurricane jose formed on september 5 peaking as a high end hurricane before weakening and making an anti cyclonic loop in the northern atlantic ocean when katia formed 2017 became the first year since 1998 in which six hurricanes have formed in a row 25 on september 17 maria became a hurricane threatening the same areas devastated by hurricane irma when lee intensified into a major hurricane on september 27 it became the first time in seven years that five major hurricanes formed activity briefly paused as september came to a close activity resumed on october 4 when tropical depression sixteen formed in the southwestern caribbean sea which strengthened into tropical storm nate on the next day as it neared the coast of nicaragua nate strengthened to a hurricane on october 7 and made two landfalls in the united states as a category 1 hurricane the first near the mouth of the mississippi river in southeastern louisiana late on october 7 and the second near biloxi mississippi early october 8 as nate became a post tropical cyclone on october 9 tropical depression seventeen formed in the eastern subtropical atlantic strengthening into tropical storm ophelia that same day ophelia became a hurricane two days later marking the first time since 1893 that 10 consecutive named storms strengthened into hurricanes on october 14 ophelia unexpectedly strengthened into a major hurricane becoming the sixth major hurricane of the season and the easternmost major hurricane in the atlantic basin on record after this the basin went quiet for some time late in the month tropical storm philippe formed south of cuba the accumulated cyclone energy ace index for the 2017 atlantic hurricane season as of on is nb 2 which is one of the highest values on record for an atlantic hurricane season as well as the most since 2005 and more than double the full season median of 92 units ace is broadly speaking a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces it is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding which is tropical storm strength with an ace value under following the dissipation of emily 2017 set the record for lowest ace produced by a first five named storms 26 despite that the 2017 season hosted the storm with the third highest ace value hurricane irma at 66.6 units and is one of only four seasons including 1966 2003 and 2004 to have at least two hurricanes with an ace value over 40 and the only season to have had three 27 2017 also hosted the day with the most ace produced september 8 and currently has the fourth highest ace value of any atlantic season since 1950 22 september also generated the highest ace value for any month in the atlantic surpassing 28 systems edit tropical storm arlene edit tropical duration april april 21 peak intensity 1 min 990 mbar hpa see also list of off season atlantic hurricanes a potent extratropical cyclone formed well east of bermuda on the cyclone moved southeast becoming disconnected from the surrounding environment and gradually losing its frontal characteristics deep convection formed in bands north and east of the center by on leading to the formation of a subtropical depression despite an unfavorable environment with ocean temperatures near and moderate wind shear convection coalesced near the center and allowed the subtropical depression to become fully tropical by on it intensified into tropical storm arlene six hours later after attaining peak winds of the storm began to rotate around a larger extratropical low the storm tracked into the cold sector of the cyclone causing arlene to lose tropical characteristics around on the post tropical cyclone moved south and east before dissipating well west southwest of the azores on 29 upon its formation as a subtropical depression on arlene was the sixth known subtropical or tropical cyclone to form in the month of april in the atlantic basin the other instances were ana in 2003 a subtropical storm in april 1992 and three tropical depressions in 1912 1915 and 1973 respectively when arlene became a tropical storm on this marked only the second such occurrence on record after ana in 2003 30 nb 3 furthermore it had the lowest central pressure of any atlantic storm recorded in the month of april with a central pressure of hpa again surpassing ana 32 additionally unrelated to arlene tropical storm adrian in the eastern pacific basin also formed before the corresponding hurricane season was set to officially begin being the earliest named storm in the eastern pacific proper this makes 2017 the second consecutive year after 2016 where the first storms in both basins were pre season storms 33 tropical storm bret edit tropical duration june june 20 peak intensity 1 min 1007 mbar hpa main article tropical storm bret 2017 a tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on june 13 and was first monitored by the national hurricane center shortly afterwards 34 development however was expected to be slow due to its low latitude and relatively fast motion as it moved swiftly across the main development region of the atlantic ocean the disturbance began to gradually organize and the nhc raised development chances slightly on june 16 35 little change in organization occurred until june 18 at which point a burst of convection near the center of the disturbance prompted the nhc to designate the system as potential tropical cyclone two at this was the first designation of a disturbance that had not yet developed into a tropical cyclone 36 the storm continued to organize as it accelerated towards venezuela and trinidad and tobago throughout the night with banding features becoming evident later on june 19 the system developed a closed low level circulation and was upgraded to tropical storm bret at 37 one day later at on june 20 the last advisory on bret was issued following its degeneration into a tropical wave 38 according to phil klotzbach of colorado state university bret was the earliest storm to form in the main development region on record surpassing a record set by tropical storm ana in 1979 39 bret was also the lowest latitude named storm in the month of june since 1933 at 40 in trinidad one person died after he slipped and fell while running across a makeshift bridge the fatality is considered indirectly related to bret 41 42 another fatality occurred in tobago after a house collapsed on him he eventually succumbed to his injuries a week later 43 tropical storm cindy edit tropical duration june june 23 peak intensity 1 min 992 mbar hpa main article tropical storm cindy 2017 the nhc first began monitoring the potential for tropical cyclone formation over the northwestern caribbean sea on 44 a large area of disturbed weather developed within the region three days later 45 and it slowly organized while entering the central gulf of mexico prompting the nhc to begin advisories on a potential tropical cyclone on the structure of the system was initially sprawling with tropical storm force winds well displaced from a broad area of low pressure with embedded swirls 46 a reconnaissance aircraft investigating the system around the following day was able to pinpoint a well defined center indicating the formation of tropical storm cindy 47 despite the presence of dry air and strong wind shear the cyclone still managed to attain peak winds of before weakening on approach to the louisiana coastline 48 it made landfall between port arthur texas and cameron louisiana early on and weakened while progressing inland 49 a state of emergency was declared for biloxi mississippi in anticipation of flooding a ten year old boy died from injuries sustained during the storm in fort morgan alabama 50 a second fatality later occurred in bolivar peninsula texas 51 tropical depression four edit tropical duration july july 7 peak intensity 1 min 1009 mbar hpa early on the nhc began tracking a tropical wave embedded within a large envelope of deep moisture across the coastline of western africa 52 the disturbance was introduced as a potential contender for tropical cyclone formation two days later as environmental conditions were expected to favor slow organization 53 it began to show signs of organization over the central atlantic early on 54 but the chances for development began to decrease two days later as the system moved toward a more stable environment 55 having already acquired a well defined circulation the development of a persistent mass of deep convection around the following day prompted the nhc to upgrade the wave to tropical depression four located about east of the lesser antilles 56 despite wind shear being low the nascent depression struggled to intensify due to a dry environment caused by a saharan air layer to its east causing the low level circulation to weaken and resulting in the tropical depression degenerating into an open tropical wave late on the next day 57 tropical storm don edit tropical duration july july 19 peak intensity 1 min 1007 mbar hpa late on the nhc highlighted a low pressure trough over the central atlantic as having the potential to develop into a tropical cyclone in the coming days 58 the disturbance began to show signs of organization early on 59 and data from a reconnaissance aircraft investigating the system confirmed the development of tropical storm don around that day 60 the overall appearance improved over subsequent hours up until around 09 00 utc as a central dense overcast accompanied by significant clusters of lightning became pronounced 61 don attained its peak intensity at this time characterised by winds of approximately 61 the next plane to investigate the cyclone a few hours later however found that the center had become less defined and that sustained wind speeds had decreased to about 62 a combination of reconnaissance data and surface observations from the windward islands indicated that don opened up into a tropical wave around on as it entered the eastern caribbean sea 63 tropical storm emily edit tropical duration july august 2 peak intensity 1 min 1005 mbar hpa in late july a dissipating cold front extended into the northeastern gulf of mexico where the nhc began forecasting the development of an area of low pressure over the next day on any development was expected to be slow due to land proximity and marginal upper level winds 64 contrary to predictions a rapid period of organization occurred over the next 24 hours and the system was deemed as tropical depression six at on 65 strengthening into tropical storm emily just two hours later after attaining its peak intensity with winds of and a minimum pressure of 1,005 mbar 29.7 inhg 66 emily made landfall on anna maria island around weakening quickly ensued and later that day the circulation of emily became elongated as it was downgraded to a tropical depression 67 the increasingly disrupted system later moved off the first coast of florida into the western atlantic early the next day accelerating northeastwards before becoming embedded within a frontal zone early on 68 following the classification of tropical storm emily florida governor rick scott declared a state of emergency for to ensure residents were provided with the necessary resources 69 the storm spawned an ef0 tornado near bradenton the tornado was on the ground for about and destroyed two barns and a few greenhouses while an engineered wall collapsed leaving about $96,000 in damage 70 on torrential rains related to emily impacted parts of miami beach with accumulations reaching in of which fell in just 71 coinciding with high tide the deluge overwhelmed flood pumps with three of them shutting down due to lightning induced power outages and resulted in significant flash floods multiple buildings suffered water damage with some having of

considerably while over the peninsula however its satellite presentation remained well defined with the inner core tightening up considerably 79 later that day franklin emerged into the bay of campeche and immediately began strengthening again becoming a hurricane late on 80 five hours after peaking in intensity with winds of and a pressure of 81 franklin made landfall in lechuguillas mexico 82 and thereafter began to rapidly weaken by on franklin had dissipated as a tropical cyclone 83 however its mid level circulation remained intact and later contributed to the formation of tropical storm jova in the eastern pacific early on 84 immediately upon classification of franklin as a potential tropical cyclone tropical storm warnings were issued for much of the eastern side of the peninsula on august 6 76 a small portion of the coastline was upgraded to a hurricane watch with the possibility of franklin nearing hurricane intensity as it approached the coastline the next night approximately 330 people were reported as going into storm shelters and around 2,200 relocated from the islands near the coastline to farther inland in advance of the storm 85 in the mexican part of the peninsula damage was reported as having being minimal mainly in belize as the storm tracked slightly more northwards then expected lessening impacts 85 nonetheless some areas received up to a foot of rain 86 hurricane gert edit category duration august august 17 peak intensity 1 min 967 mbar hpa on the nhc began monitoring a tropical wave and its associated convection over the western coast of africa 87 as the disturbance tracked west northwest its structure changed little in organization but environmental conditions were expected to support the formation of a tropical cyclone 88 instead the system remained poorly defined and entered a less conducive environment east of the leeward islands 89 after progressing into the southwestern atlantic several days later the wave encountered more favorable upper level winds and began to show signs of organization 90 following the formation of a well defined circulation the disturbance was upgraded to a tropical depression at on 91 by that afternoon it intensified into tropical storm gert 92 at on gert intensified to a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of making it the second hurricane of the season 93 accelerating east northeastwards gert peaked as a system early on at an unusually high latitude of 94 thereafter gert began to rapidly weaken as it shifted from the gulf stream over cooler waters 95 just after achieving peak intensity gert weakened below hurricane status and evolved to an extratropical cyclone well east of nova scotia 96 two people drowned due to strong rip currents produced by the

africa within a few days 99 instead the two systems remained separate 100 with the first low pressure area coalescing into a potential tropical cyclone by on 101 a reconnaissance aircraft investigating the system was able to locate a well defined circulation and the disturbance was upgraded to tropical storm harvey accordingly six hours later 102 on a westward course into the caribbean sea the storm was plagued by relentless wind shear and it degenerated to an open tropical wave south of hispaniola by on 103 remnants continued into the bay of campeche where more conducive environmental conditions led to the re designation of a tropical depression around on and subsequent intensification into a tropical storm by on the next morning 104 105 the tropical cyclone began a period of rapid intensification shortly thereafter attaining hurricane intensity by on 106 strength around on 107 and intensity by on that day 106 harvey crossed the shore between port aransas and port texas around on possessing maximum winds of 108 the storm gradually spun down becoming a tropical storm around on as it meandered across southeastern texas 109 a light steering pattern caused the storm to emerge into the gulf of mexico on 110 but a turn toward the north northeast brought it ashore west of cameron louisiana as a weak tropical storm around on 111 the system weakened to a tropical depression over central louisiana late that day before losing tropical characteristics over central tennessee early on 112 113 rockport fulton and the surrounding cities bore the brunt of eyewall as it moved ashore in texas numerous structures were heavily damaged or destroyed boats were tossed or capsized power poles were leant or snapped and trees were downed as debris covered roadways and cellphone service was compromised communication to the hardest hit locales was severed one person was killed in rockport after a fire began in his home and approximately a dozen people were injured 114 farther northeast dire predictions of potentially catastrophic flooding came to fruition in houston and nearby locales where floodwaters submerged interstates forced residents to their attics and roofs and overwhelmed emergency lines the national weather service tweeted this event is unprecedented all impacts are unknown beyond anything experienced at least 30 people were killed in the houston area due to flooding 115 in addition to the flooding harvey spawned several tornadoes around houston 116 estimates place the damage caused by harvey at 117 harvey killed 90

hurricane on record in the atlantic basin maintaining peak intensity for 37 consecutive hours irma is the only tropical cyclone on record worldwide to have had winds that intense for so long as the storm moved through the northern leeward islands it became the only to make a direct impact there its landfall intensity ties it with the 1935 labor day hurricane as the strongest landfalling cyclone on record in the atlantic two hurricanes harvey and irma struck the continental united states in the span of two weeks this marks the first time the country has suffered two landfalls of such intensity during the same hurricane season in recorded history lastly irma accrued the third highest accumulated cyclone energy index on record 137 in the aftermath of irma development on the islands

later 167 168 the nhc monitored the remnants of lee intermittently for several days but regeneration was not considered likely 169 170 however the mid level remnants of the cyclone became intertwined with an upper level trough a deep burst of convection led to a new surface circulation and by on the system reorganized into tropical depression lee 171 it intensified into a tropical storm six hours later 172 a compact cyclone lee organized as small curved bands wrapped into a small cluster of central convection 173 a microwave pass around on indicated the formation of a ring of shallow to moderate convection around the center often a harbinger of rapid intensification 174 indeed by the next morning the presence of an eye on satellite imagery prompted the nhc to abruptly upgrade lee to a hurricane as it moved erratically 175 after attaining winds of the storm weakened slightly due to moderate southeasterly wind shear 176 by on however the storm attained strength 177 an eyewall
