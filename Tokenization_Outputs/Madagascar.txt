an island country in the indian ocean off the coast of east africa the nation comprises the island of madagascar the fourth largest island in the world and numerous smaller peripheral islands following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent gondwana madagascar split from the indian peninsula around years ago allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation consequently madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on earth the diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats the first archaeological evidence for human foraging on madagascar dates to human settlement of madagascar occurred between and by austronesian peoples arriving on outrigger canoes from borneo these were joined around ad 1000 by bantu migrants crossing the mozambique channel from east africa other groups continued to settle on madagascar over time each one making lasting contributions to malagasy cultural life the malagasy ethnic group is often divided into 18 or more sub groups of which the largest are the merina of the central highlands until the late 18th century the island of madagascar was ruled by a fragmented assortment of shifting sociopolitical alliances beginning in the early 19th century most of the island was united and ruled as the kingdom of madagascar by a series of merina nobles the monarchy collapsed in 1897 when the island was absorbed into the french colonial empire from which the island gained independence in 1960 the autonomous state of madagascar has since undergone four major constitutional periods termed republics since 1992 the nation has officially been governed as a constitutional democracy from its capital at antananarivo however in a popular uprising in 2009 president marc ravalomanana was made to resign and presidential power was transferred in march 2009 to andry rajoelina constitutional governance was restored in january 2014 when hery rajaonarimampianina was named president following a 2013 election deemed fair and transparent by the international community madagascar is a member of the united nations the african union au the southern african development community sadc and the organisation internationale de la francophonie madagascar belongs to the group of least developed countries according to the united nations 10 malagasy and french are both official languages of the state the majority of the population adheres to traditional beliefs christianity or an amalgamation of both ecotourism and agriculture paired with greater investments in education health and private enterprise are key elements of development strategy under ravalomanana these investments produced substantial economic growth but the benefits were not evenly spread throughout the population producing tensions over the increasing cost of living and declining living standards among the poor and some segments of the middle class as of 2017 update the economy has been weakened by the political crisis and quality of life remains low for the majority of the malagasy population contents 1

the malagasy language the island of madagascar is called madagasikara and its people are referred to as malagasy 11 the appellation madagascar is not of local origin but rather was popularized in the middle ages by europeans 12 the name madageiscar was first recorded in the memoirs of 13th century venetian explorer marco polo as a corrupted transliteration of the name mogadishu the somali port with which polo had confused the island 13 on st laurence s day in 1500 portuguese explorer diogo dias landed on the island and named it name was preferred and popularized on renaissance maps no single malagasy language name predating madagasikara appears to have been used by the local population to refer to the island although some communities had their own name for part or all of the land they inhabited 13 geography edit main article geography of madagascar the terraced paddy fields of the central highlands of madagascar left give way to tropical rainforest along the eastern coast center bordered by the shores of the indian ocean right at 592,800 square kilometres 14 madagascar is the 47th largest country 15 and the fourth largest island 14 the country lies mostly between latitudes and and longitudes and 16 neighboring islands include the french territory of and the country of mauritius to the east as well as the state of comoros and the french territory of mayotte to the north west the nearest mainland state is mozambique located to the west the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent gondwana separated the landmass from the america landmass around years ago madagascar later split from india about years ago allowing plants and animals on the island to evolve in relative isolation 17 along the length of the eastern coast runs a narrow and steep escarpment containing much of the remaining tropical lowland forest to the west of this ridge lies a plateau in the center of the island ranging in altitude from 750 to 2,460 to above sea level these central highlands traditionally the homeland of the merina people and the location of their historic capital at antananarivo are the most densely populated part of the island and are characterized by terraced rice growing valleys lying between grassy hills and patches of the subhumid forests that formerly covered the highland region to the west of the highlands the increasingly arid terrain gradually slopes down to the mozambique channel and mangrove swamps along the coast 18 the grassy plains that dominate the western landscape are dotted with stony massifs left patches of deciduous forest and baobab trees center while the south is characterized by desert and spiny forests right highest peaks rise from three prominent highland massifs maromokotro in the tsaratanana massif is the highest point followed by boby peak in the andringitra massif and tsiafajavona in the ankaratra massif to the east the canal des pangalanes is a chain of man made and natural lakes connected by canals built by the french just inland from the east coast and running parallel to it for some 19 the western and southern sides which lie in the rain shadow of the central highlands are home to dry deciduous forests spiny forests and deserts and xeric shrublands due to their lower population densities dry deciduous forests have been better preserved than the eastern rain forests or the original woodlands of the central plateau the western coast features many protected harbors but silting is a major problem caused by sediment from the high levels of inland erosion carried by rivers crossing the broad western plains 19 climate edit a climate classification map of madagascar biogeographic timetable of madagascar over the last 200 million years see also geography of madagascar the combination of southeastern trade winds and northwestern monsoons produces a hot rainy season with frequently destructive cyclones and a relatively cooler dry season rain clouds originating over the indian ocean discharge much of their moisture over the eastern coast the heavy precipitation supports the rain forest ecosystem the central highlands are both drier and cooler while the west is drier still and a semi arid climate prevails in the southwest and southern interior of the island 18 tropical cyclones annually cause damage to infrastructure and local economies as well as loss of life 20 in 2004 cyclone gafilo became the strongest cyclone ever recorded to hit madagascar the storm killed 172 people left 214,260 homeless 21 and caused more than in damage 22 ecology edit main articles wildlife

and animal species found in madagascar are endemic 25 including the lemurs a type of strepsirrhine primate the carnivorous fossa and many birds this distinctive ecology has led some ecologists to refer to madagascar as the eighth continent 26 and the island has been classified by conservation international as a biodiversity hotspot 23 more than of 14,883 plant species are found nowhere else in the world including five plant families 27 the family didiereaceae composed of four genera and 11 species is limited to the spiny forests of southwestern madagascar 18 four fifths of the pachypodium species are endemic to the island 28 three fourths 29 of 860 27 orchid species are found here alone as are six of the nine baobab species 30 the island is home to around 170 palm species three times as many as on all of mainland africa 165 of them are endemic 29 many native plant species are used as herbal remedies for a variety of afflictions the drugs vinblastine 31 32 and vincristine 31 33 are vinca alkaloids 34 35 used to treat disease 36 leukemia 37 and other cancers 38 were derived from the madagascar periwinkle 39 40 the palm known locally as ravinala 41 and endemic to the eastern rain forests 42 is highly iconic of madagascar and is featured in the national emblem as well as the air madagascar logo 43 the ring tailed lemur is one of over 100 known species and subspecies of lemur found only in madagascar 44 like its flora fauna is diverse and exhibits a high rate of endemism lemurs have been characterized as flagship mammal species by conservation international 23 in the absence of monkeys and other competitors these primates have adapted to a wide range of habitats and diversified into numerous species as of 2012 update there were officially 103 species and subspecies of lemur 45 39 of which were described by zoologists between 2000 and 2008 46 they are almost all classified as rare vulnerable or endangered at least 17 species of lemur have become extinct since humans arrived on madagascar all of which were larger than the surviving lemur species 47 a number of other mammals including the cat like fossa are endemic to madagascar over 300 species of birds have been recorded on the island of which over including four families and 42 genera are endemic 23 the few families and genera of reptile that have reached madagascar have diversified into more than 260 species with over of these being endemic 48 including one endemic family 23 the island is home to two thirds of the chameleon species 48 including the smallest known 49 and researchers have proposed that madagascar may be the origin of all chameleons endemic fish of madagascar include two families 15 genera and over 100 species primarily inhabiting the freshwater lakes and rivers although invertebrates remain poorly studied on madagascar researchers have found high rates of endemism among the known species all 651 species of terrestrial snail are endemic as are a majority of the butterflies scarab beetles lacewings spiders and dragonflies 23 environmental issues edit main articles deforestation in madagascar and illegal logging in madagascar tavy slash and burn destruction of native forest habitat is widespread left causing massive erosion center and silting of rivers right varied fauna and flora are endangered by human activity 50 since the arrival of humans around ago madagascar has lost more than of its original forest 51 this forest loss is largely fueled by tavy fat a traditional slash and burn agricultural practice imported to madagascar by the earliest settlers 52 malagasy farmers embrace and perpetuate the practice not only for its practical benefits as an agricultural technique but for its cultural associations with prosperity health and venerated ancestral custom fomba malagasy 53 as human population density rose on the island deforestation accelerated beginning around 1400 years ago 54 by the 16th century the central highlands had been largely cleared of their original forests 52 more recent contributors to the loss of forest cover include the growth in cattle herd size since their introduction around 1000 years ago a continued reliance on charcoal as a fuel for cooking and the increased prominence of coffee as a cash crop over the past century 55 according to a conservative estimate about of the original forest cover was lost from the 1950s to 2000 with a thinning of remaining forest areas by 56 in addition to traditional agricultural practice wildlife conservation is challenged by the illicit harvesting of protected forests as well as the state sanctioned harvesting of precious woods within national parks although banned by then president marc ravalomanana from 2000 to 2009 the collection of small quantities of precious timber from national parks was re authorized in january 2009 and dramatically intensified under the administration of andry rajoelina as a key source of state revenues to offset cuts in donor support following ousting 57 it is anticipated that all the rainforests excluding those in protected areas and the steepest eastern mountain slopes will have been deforested by 2025 58 invasive species have likewise been introduced by human populations following the 2014 discovery in madagascar of the asian common toad a relative of a toad species that has severely harmed wildlife in australia since the 1930s researchers warned the toad could wreak havoc on the unique fauna 59 habitat destruction and hunting have threatened many of endemic species or driven them to extinction the elephant birds a family of endemic giant ratites became extinct in the 17th century or earlier most probably due to human hunting of adult birds and poaching of their large eggs for food 60 numerous giant lemur species vanished with the arrival of human settlers to the island while others became extinct over the course of the centuries as a growing human population put greater pressures on lemur habitats and among some populations increased the rate of lemur hunting for food 61 a july 2012 assessment found that the exploitation of natural resources since 2009 has had dire consequences for the wildlife of lemur species were found to be threatened with extinction the highest proportion of any mammalian group of these 23 species were classified as critically endangered by contrast a previous study in 2008 had found only of lemur species were at risk of extinction 45 in 2003 ravalomanana announced the durban vision an initiative to more than triple the protected natural areas to over 2 or of land surface as of 2011 update areas protected by the state included five strict nature reserves naturelles 21 wildlife reserves and 21 national parks parcs nationaux 62 in 2007 six of the national parks were declared a joint world heritage site under the name rainforests of the atsinanana these parks are marojejy masoala ranomafana zahamena andohahela and andringitra 63 local timber merchants are harvesting scarce species of rosewood trees from protected rainforests within marojejy national park and exporting the wood to china for the production of luxury furniture and musical instruments 64 to raise public awareness of environmental challenges the wildlife conservation society opened an exhibit entitled madagascar in june 2008 at the bronx zoo in new york 65 history edit main article history of madagascar early period edit malagasy ancestry reflects a blend of austronesian southeast asian and bantu east african roots the settlement of madagascar is a subject of ongoing research and debate archaeological finds such as cut marks on bones found in the northwest and stone tools in the northeast indicate that madagascar was visited by foragers around 66 67 traditionally archaeologists have estimated that the earliest settlers arrived in successive waves throughout the period between and while others are cautious about dates earlier than in either case these dates make madagascar one of the last major landmasses on earth to be settled by humans 68 early settlers arrived in outrigger canoes from southern borneo upon arrival early settlers practiced slash and burn agriculture to clear the coastal rainforests for cultivation the first settlers encountered abundance of megafauna including giant lemurs elephant birds giant fossa and the malagasy hippopotamus which have since become extinct due to hunting and habitat destruction 69 by groups of these early settlers had begun clearing the forests of the central highlands 70 arab traders first reached the island between the seventh and ninth centuries 71 a wave of bantu speaking migrants from southeastern africa arrived around they introduced the zebu a type of long horned humped cattle which they kept in large herds 52 by 1600 irrigated paddy fields were developed in the central highland betsileo kingdom and were extended with terraced paddies throughout the neighboring kingdom of imerina a century later 70 the rising intensity of land cultivation and the ever increasing demand for zebu pasturage had largely transformed the central highlands from a forest ecosystem to grassland by the 17th century 52 the oral histories of the merina people who may have arrived in the central highlands between 600 and 1000 years ago describe encountering an established population they called the vazimba probably the descendants of an earlier and less technologically advanced austronesian settlement wave the vazimba were assimilated or expelled from the highlands by the merina kings andriamanelo ralambo and andrianjaka in the 16th and early 17th centuries 72 today the spirits of the vazimba are revered as tompontany ancestral masters of the land by many traditional malagasy communities 73 arab and european contacts edit a pirate cemetery at sainte marie madagascar was an important transoceanic trading hub connecting ports of the indian ocean in the early centuries following human settlement the written history of madagascar began with the arabs who established trading posts along the northwest coast by at least the 10th century and introduced islam the arabic script used to transcribe the malagasy language in a form of writing known as sorabe arab astrology and other cultural elements 20 european contact began in 1500 when the portuguese sea captain diogo dias sighted the island 14 the french established trading posts along the east coast in the late 17th century 20 from about 1774 to 1824 madagascar gained prominence among pirates and european traders particularly those involved in the trans atlantic slave trade the small island of nosy boroha off the northeastern coast of madagascar has been proposed by some historians as the site of the legendary pirate utopia of libertalia 74 many european sailors were shipwrecked on the coasts of the island among them robert drury whose journal is one of the few written depictions of life in southern madagascar during the 18th century 75 the wealth generated by maritime trade spurred the rise of organized kingdoms on the island some of which had grown quite powerful by the 17th century 76 among these were the betsimisaraka alliance of the eastern coast and the sakalava chiefdoms of menabe and boina on the west coast the kingdom of imerina located in the central highlands with its capital at the royal palace of antananarivo emerged at around the same time under the leadership of king andriamanelo 77 kingdom of madagascar edit main article merina kingdom king andrianampoinimerina upon its emergence in the early 17th century the highland kingdom of imerina was initially a minor power relative to the larger coastal kingdoms 77 and grew even weaker in the early 18th century when king andriamasinavalona divided it among his four sons following almost a century of warring and famine imerina was reunited in 1793 by king andrianampoinimerina 78 from his initial capital ambohimanga 79 and later from the rova of antananarivo this merina king rapidly expanded his rule over neighboring principalities his ambition to bring the entire island under his control was largely achieved by his son and successor king radama i who was recognized by the british government as king of madagascar radama concluded a treaty in 1817 with the british governor of mauritius to abolish the lucrative slave trade in return for british military and financial assistance artisan missionary envoys from the london missionary society began arriving in 1818 and included such key figures as james cameron david jones and david griffiths who established schools transcribed the malagasy language using the roman alphabet translated the bible and introduced a variety of new technologies to the island 80 successor queen ranavalona i responded to increasing political and cultural encroachment on the part of britain and france by issuing a royal edict prohibiting the practice of christianity in madagascar and pressuring most foreigners to leave the territory residents of madagascar could accuse one another of various crimes including theft christianity and especially witchcraft for which the ordeal of tangena was routinely obligatory between 1828 and 1861 the tangena ordeal caused about 3,000 deaths annually 81 among those who continued to reside in imerina were jean laborde an entrepreneur who developed munitions and other industries on behalf of the monarchy and lambert a french adventurer and slave trader with whom then prince radama ii signed a controversial trade agreement termed the lambert charter succeeding his mother radama ii attempted to relax the stringent policies but was overthrown two years later by prime minister rainivoninahitriniony and an alliance of andriana noble and hova commoner courtiers who sought to end the absolute power of the monarch 20 following the coup the courtiers offered queen rasoherina the opportunity to rule if she would accept a power sharing arrangement with the prime new social contract that would be sealed by a political marriage between them 82 queen rasoherina accepted first wedding rainivoninahitriniony then later deposing him and wedding his brother prime minister rainilaiarivony who would go on to marry queen ranavalona ii and queen ranavalona iii in succession 83 over the course of 31 year tenure as prime minister numerous policies were adopted to modernize and consolidate the power of the central government 84 schools were constructed throughout the island and attendance was made mandatory army organization was improved and british consultants were employed to train and professionalize soldiers 85 polygamy was outlawed and christianity declared the official religion of the court in 1869 was adopted alongside traditional beliefs among a growing portion of the populace 84 legal codes were reformed on the basis of british common law and three european style courts were established in the capital city 85 in his joint role as commander in chief rainilaiarivony also successfully ensured the defense of madagascar against several french colonial incursions 85 french colonization edit main articles malagasy protectorate and french madagascar a french poster about the franco hova war bond of the french colony madagascar issued 7 may 1897 primarily on the basis that the lambert charter had not been respected france invaded madagascar in 1883 in what became known as the first franco hova war 86 at the end of the war madagascar ceded the northern port town of antsiranana diego suarez to france and paid 560,000 francs to heirs 87 in 1890 the british accepted the full formal imposition of a french protectorate on the island but french authority was not acknowledged by the government of madagascar to force capitulation the french bombarded and occupied the harbor of toamasina on the east coast and mahajanga on the west coast in december 1894 and january 1895 respectively 88 a french military flying column then marched toward antananarivo losing many men to malaria and other diseases reinforcements came from algeria and sub saharan africa upon reaching the city in september 1895 the column bombarded the royal palace with heavy artillery causing heavy casualties and leading queen ranavalona iii to surrender 89 france annexed madagascar in 1896 and declared the island a colony the following year dissolving the merina monarchy and sending the royal family into exile on island and to algeria a two year resistance movement organized in response to the french capture of the royal palace was effectively put down at the end of 1897 90 under colonial rule plantations were established for the production of a variety of export crops 91 slavery was abolished in 1896 and approximately 500,000 slaves were freed many remained in their former masters homes as servants 92 or as sharecroppers in many parts of the island strong discriminatory views against slave descendants are still held today 93 wide paved boulevards and gathering places were constructed in the capital city of antananarivo 94 and the rova palace compound was turned into a museum 95 additional schools were built particularly in rural and coastal areas where the schools of the merina had not reached education became mandatory between the ages of 6 to 13 and focused primarily on french language and practical skills 96 the merina royal tradition of taxes paid in the form of labor was continued under the french and used to construct a railway and roads linking key coastal cities to antananarivo 97 malagasy troops fought for france in world war i 14 in the 1930s nazi political thinkers developed the madagascar plan that had identified the island as a potential site for the deportation of jews 98 during the second world war the island was the site of the battle of madagascar between the vichy government and the british 99 the occupation of france during the second world war tarnished the prestige of the colonial administration in madagascar and galvanized the growing independence movement leading to the malagasy uprising of 1947 100 this movement led the french to establish reformed institutions in 1956 under the loi cadre overseas reform act and madagascar moved peacefully towards independence 101 the malagasy republic was proclaimed on 14 october 1958 as an autonomous state within the french community a period of provisional government ended with the adoption of a constitution in 1959 and full independence on 26 june 1960 102

independence madagascar has transitioned through four republics with corresponding revisions to its constitution the first republic under the leadership of french appointed president philibert tsiranana was characterized by a continuation of strong economic and political ties to france many high level technical positions were filled by french expatriates and french teachers textbooks and curricula continued to be used in schools around the country popular resentment over tolerance for this neo colonial arrangement inspired a series of farmer and student protests that overturned his administration in 1972 20 gabriel ramanantsoa a major general in the army was appointed interim president and prime minister that same year but low public approval forced him to step down in 1975 colonel richard ratsimandrava appointed to succeed him was assassinated six days into his tenure general gilles andriamahazo ruled after ratsimandrava for four months before being replaced by another military appointee vice admiral didier ratsiraka who ushered in the socialist marxist second republic that ran under his tenure from 1975 to 1993 this period saw a political alignment with the eastern bloc countries and a shift toward economic insularity these policies coupled with economic pressures stemming from the 1973 oil crisis resulted in the rapid collapse of economy and a sharp decline in living standards 20 and the country had become completely bankrupt by 1979 the ratsiraka administration accepted the conditions of transparency anti corruption measures and free market policies imposed by the international monetary fund world bank and various bilateral donors in exchange for their bailout of the broken economy 103 dwindling popularity in the late 1980s reached a critical point in 1991 when presidential guards opened fire on unarmed protesters during a rally within two months a transitional government had been established under the leadership of albert zafy who went on to win the 1992 presidential elections and inaugurate the third republic 104 the new madagascar constitution established a multi party democracy and a separation of powers that placed significant control in the hands of the national assembly the new constitution also emphasized human rights social and political freedoms and free trade 20 term however was marred by economic decline allegations of corruption and his introduction of legislation to give himself greater powers he was consequently impeached in 1996 and an interim president norbert ratsirahonana was appointed for the three months prior to the next presidential election ratsiraka was then voted back into power on a platform of decentralization and economic reforms for a second term which lasted from 1996 to 2001 103 the contested 2001 presidential elections in which then mayor of antananarivo marc ravalomanana eventually emerged victorious caused a seven month standoff in 2002 between supporters of ravalomanana and ratsiraka the negative economic impact of the political crisis was gradually overcome by progressive economic and political policies which encouraged investments in education and ecotourism facilitated foreign direct investment and cultivated trading partnerships both regionally and internationally national gdp grew at an average rate of per year under his administration in the later half of his second term ravalomanana was criticised by domestic and international observers who accused him of increasing authoritarianism and corruption 103 opposition leader and then mayor of antananarivo andry rajoelina led a movement in early 2009 in which ravalomanana was pushed from power in an unconstitutional process widely condemned as a coup in march 2009 rajoelina was declared by the supreme court as the president of the high transitional authority an interim governing body responsible for moving the country toward presidential elections in 2010 a new constitution was adopted

the ministerial cabinet the senate and the national assembly although in reality these two latter bodies have very little power or legislative role the constitution establishes independent executive legislative and judicial branches and mandates a popularly elected president limited to three five year terms 14 the public directly elects the president and the 127 members of the national assembly to five year terms all 33 members of the senate serve six year terms with 22 senators elected by local officials and 11 appointed by the president the last national assembly election was held on 20

detentions in unsanitary and overcrowded prisons 108 antananarivo is the administrative capital and largest city of madagascar 14 it is located in the highlands region near the geographic center of the island king andrianjaka founded antananarivo as the capital of his imerina kingdom around 1610 or 1625 upon the site of a captured vazimba capital on the hilltop of analamanga 72 as merina dominance expanded over neighboring malagasy peoples in the early 19th century to establish the kingdom of madagascar antananarivo became the center of administration for virtually the entire island in 1896 the french colonizers of madagascar adopted the merina capital as their center of colonial administration the city remained the capital of madagascar after regaining independence in 1960 in

international relations and malagasy living standards the eight month standoff between incumbent ratsiraka and challenger marc ravalomanana following the 2001 presidential elections cost madagascar millions of dollars in lost tourism and trade revenue as well as damage to infrastructure such as bombed bridges and buildings damaged by arson 110 a series of protests led by andry rajoelina against ravalomanana in early 2009 became violent with more than 170 people killed 111 modern politics in madagascar are colored by the history of merina subjugation of coastal communities under their rule in the 19th century the consequent tension between the highland and coastal populations has periodically flared up into isolated events of violence 112 madagascar has historically been perceived as being on the margin of mainstream african affairs despite being a founding member of the organisation of african unity which was established in 1963 and dissolved in 2002 to be replaced by the african union

toamasina by members of the london missionary society lms the lms was invited by king radama i to expand its schools throughout imerina to teach basic literacy and numeracy to aristocratic children the schools were closed by ranavalona i in 1835 146 but reopened and expanded in the decades after her death by the end of the 19th century madagascar had the most developed and modern school system in pre colonial sub saharan africa access to schooling was expanded in coastal areas during the colonial period with french language and basic work skills becoming the focus of the curriculum during the post colonial first republic a continued reliance on french nationals as teachers and french as the language of instruction displeased those desiring a complete separation from the former colonial power 20 consequently under the socialist second republic french instructors and other nationals were expelled malagasy was declared the language of instruction and a large cadre of young malagasy were rapidly trained to teach at remote rural schools under the mandatory two year national service policy 147 this policy known as malgachization coincided with a severe economic downturn and a dramatic decline in the quality of education those schooled during this period generally failed to master the french language or many other subjects and struggled to find employment forcing many to take low paying jobs in the informal or black market that mired them in deepening poverty excepting the brief presidency of albert zafy from 1992 to 1996 ratsiraka remained in power from 1975 to 2001

when madagascar came under the authority of france in the first national constitution of 1958 malagasy and french were named the official languages of the malagasy republic madagascar is a francophone country and french is mostly spoken as a second language among the educated population and used for international communication 20 no official languages were recorded in the constitution of 1992 although malagasy was identified as the national language nonetheless many sources still claimed that malagasy and french were official languages eventually leading a citizen to initiate a legal case against the state in april 2000 on the grounds that the publication of official documents only in the french language was unconstitutional the high constitutional court observed in its decision that in the absence of a language law french still had the character of an official language 156 in the constitution of 2007 malagasy remained the national language while official languages were reintroduced malagasy french and english 157 english was removed as an official language from the constitution approved by voters in the november 2010 referendum 1 the outcome of the referendum and its consequences for official and national language policy are not recognized by the political opposition who cite lack of transparency and inclusiveness in the way the election was organized by the high transitional authority 104 language policy over the years madagascar has had different language policies under different influences of authority the indigenous language of madagascar malagasy was the predominant language on the island until the french colonization in 1897 malagasy has developed throughout the decades from an oral language to a language that has a written system latin orthography a change that was enforced by king radama i in 1823 following the french colonization the language of instruction and media changed from malagasy to almost exclusively french moreover the first french governor general gallieni also encouraged the french officials to learn malagasy as well after the advent of the malagasy independence the madagascans tried to reinstate malagasy as a language of instruction especially in secondary schools however the language policy was inadequately planned and malagasy was struggling to surpass french as the language of instruction 158 today madagascar has two official languages malagasy and french madagascar managed to maintain the indigenous language malagasy in society and in schools despite the colonizing power malagasy and french are both the language of instruction in primary and secondary schools in madagascar the inclusion of the african language as a medium of instruction is usually uncommon in other colonized african

to emphasize links between the living and the razana ancestors the veneration of ancestors has led to the widespread tradition of tomb building as well as the highlands practice of the famadihana whereby a deceased family remains are exhumed and re wrapped in fresh silk shrouds before being replaced in the tomb the famadihana is an occasion to celebrate the beloved memory reunite with family and community and enjoy a festive atmosphere residents of surrounding villages are often invited to attend the party where food and rum are typically served and a hiragasy troupe or other musical entertainment is commonly present 161 consideration for ancestors is also demonstrated through adherence to fady taboos that are respected during and after the lifetime of the person who establishes them it is widely believed that by showing respect for ancestors in these ways they may intervene on behalf of the living conversely misfortunes are often attributed to ancestors whose memory or wishes have been neglected the sacrifice of zebu is a traditional method used to appease or honor the ancestors in addition the malagasy traditionally believe in a creator god called zanahary or andriamanitra 162 according to the pew research center only 4.5% of madagascans practice folk religions and 85% are christian with practitioners of protestantism outnumbering adherents to roman catholicism 160 in 1818 the london missionary society sent the first christian missionaries to the island where they built churches translated the bible into the malagasy language and began to gain converts beginning in 1835 queen ranavalona i persecuted these converts as part of an attempt to halt european cultural and political influence on the island in 1869 a successor queen ranavalona ii converted the court to christianity and encouraged christian missionary activity burning the sampy royal idols in a symbolic break with traditional beliefs 163 today many christians integrate their religious beliefs with traditional ones related to honoring the ancestors for instance they may bless their dead at church before proceeding with traditional burial rites or invite a christian minister to consecrate a famadihana reburial 161 the malagasy council of churches comprises the four oldest and most prominent christian denominations of madagascar roman catholic church of jesus christ in madagascar lutheran and anglican and has been an influential force in malagasy politics 164 islam is also practiced on the island islam was first brought to madagascar in the middle ages by arab and somali muslim traders who established several islamic schools along the eastern coast while the use of arabic script and loan words and the adoption of islamic astrology would spread across the island the islamic religion failed to take hold in all but a handful of southeastern coastal communities today muslims constitute of the population of madagascar and are largely concentrated in the northwestern provinces of mahajanga and antsiranana the vast majority of muslims are sunni muslims are divided between those of malagasy ethnicity indians pakistanis and comorians more recently

their unique identities however there are a number of core cultural features that are common throughout the island creating a strongly unified malagasy cultural identity in addition to a common language and shared traditional religious beliefs around a creator god and veneration of the ancestors the traditional malagasy worldview is shaped by values that emphasize fihavanana solidarity vintana destiny tody karma and hasina a sacred life force that traditional communities believe imbues and thereby legitimates authority figures within the community or family other cultural elements commonly found throughout the island include the practice of male circumcision strong kinship ties a widespread belief in the power of magic diviners astrology and witch doctors and a traditional division of social classes into nobles commoners and slaves 20 162 although social castes are no longer legally recognized ancestral caste affiliation often continues to affect social status economic

famadihana according to a traditional astrological system introduced by arabs similarly the nobles of many malagasy communities in the pre colonial period would commonly employ advisers known as the ombiasy from olona be hasina man of much virtue of the southeastern antemoro ethnic group who trace their ancestry back to early arab settlers 167 the diverse origins of malagasy culture are evident in its tangible expressions the most emblematic instrument of madagascar the valiha is a bamboo tube zither carried to madagascar by early settlers from southern borneo and is very similar in form to those found in indonesia and the philippines today 168 traditional houses in madagascar are likewise similar to those of southern borneo in terms of symbolism and construction featuring a rectangular layout with a peaked roof and central support pillar 169 reflecting a widespread veneration of the ancestors tombs are culturally significant in many regions and tend to be built of more durable material typically stone and display more elaborate decoration than the houses of the living 170 the production and weaving of silk can be traced back to the earliest settlers and national dress the woven lamba has evolved into a varied and refined art 171 the southeast asian cultural influence is also evident in malagasy cuisine in which rice is consumed at every meal typically accompanied by one of a variety of flavorful vegetable or meat dishes 172 african influence is reflected in the sacred importance of zebu cattle and their embodiment of their wealth traditions originating on the african mainland cattle rustling originally a rite of passage for young men in the plains areas of madagascar where the largest herds of cattle are kept has become a dangerous and sometimes deadly criminal enterprise as herdsmen in the southwest attempt to defend their cattle with traditional spears against increasingly armed professional rustlers 70 arts edit a hiragasy dancer a wide variety

proverbs 173 174 an epic poem exemplifying these traditions the ibonia has been handed down over the centuries in several different forms across the island and offers insight into the diverse mythologies and beliefs of traditional malagasy communities 175 this tradition was continued in the 20th century by such artists as jean joseph rabearivelo who is considered first modern poet 176 and elie rajaonarison an exemplar of the new wave of malagasy poetry 177 madagascar has also developed a rich musical heritage embodied in dozens of regional musical genres such as the coastal salegy or highland hiragasy that enliven village gatherings local dance floors and national airwaves 178 additionally madagascar also has a growing culture of classical music fostered through youth academies organizations and orchestras that promote youth involvement in classical music the plastic arts are also widespread throughout the island in addition to the tradition of silk weaving and lamba production the weaving of raffia and other local plant materials has been used to create a wide array of practical items such as floor mats baskets purses and hats 140 wood carving is a highly developed art form with distinct regional styles evident in the decoration of balcony railings and other architectural elements sculptors create a variety of furniture and household goods aloalo funerary posts and wooden sculptures many of which are produced for the tourist market 179 the decorative and functional woodworking traditions of the zafimaniry people of the central highlands was inscribed on list of intangible cultural heritage in 2008 180 among the antaimoro people the production of paper embedded with flowers and other decorative natural materials is a long established tradition that the community has begun to market to eco tourists 179 embroidery and drawn thread work are done by hand to produce clothing as well as tablecloths and other home textiles for sale in local crafts markets 140 a small but growing number of fine art galleries in antananarivo and several other urban areas offer paintings by local artists and annual art events such as the hosotra open
