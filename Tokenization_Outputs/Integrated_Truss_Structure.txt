integrated truss structure wikipedia integrated truss structure from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search iss elements as of june 2017 update the integrated truss structure its of the international space station iss consists of a linearly arranged sequence of connected trusses on which various unpressurized components are mounted such as logistics carriers radiators solar arrays and other equipment it supplies the iss with a bus architecture it is approximately 110 meters long and is made from aluminum and stainless steel contents 1 truss components 1.1 z1 truss 1.2 s0 truss 1.3 p1 s1 trusses 1.4 p2 s2 trusses 1.5 p3 p4 s3 s4 truss assemblies 1.6 p5 s5 trusses 1.7 p6 s6 trusses 1.8 gallery of trusses 2 truss subsystems 2.1 solar arrays 2.2 solar alpha rotary joint 2.3 power conditioning and storage 2.4 mobile base system 3 truss and solar array assembly sequence 17 4 see also 5 references 6 external links truss components edit all truss components were named after their planned end positions z for zenith s for starboard and p for port with the number indicating the sequential position the s0 truss might be considered a misnomer as it is mounted centrally on the zenith position of destiny and is neither starboard nor port side z1 truss edit z1 truss z1 truss is above the module the first truss piece the z1 truss launched aboard sts 92 in october 2000 it contains the control moment gyroscope cmg assemblies electrical wiring communications equipment and two plasma contactors designed to neutralize the static electrical charge of the space station another objective of the z1 truss was to serve as a temporary mounting position for the p6 truss and solar array until its relocation to the end of the p5 truss during sts 120 though not a part of the main truss the z1 truss was the first permanent lattice work structure for the iss very much like a girder setting the stage for the future addition of the major trusses or backbones while the bulk of the z1 truss is unpressurized it features a common berthing mechanism cbm port that connects its nadir to the zenith port of unity and contains a small pressurized dome that allowed astronauts to connect electrical ground straps between unity and the truss without an eva 1 2 in addition the dome inside the cbm of z1 can be used as storage space 3 the z1 truss also features a forward facing manual berthing mechanism mbm ring 4 this mbm is not a port and is not pressurized or electrically powered but it can be operated with a handheld tool to berth any passive cbm to it 5 the z1 mbm was used only once to temporarily hold pma 2 while the destiny lab was being berthed onto the unity node during sts 98 since the installation of the nearby s0 truss in april 2002 access to the mbm has been blocked in october 2007 the p6 was moved to its permanent position next to z1 truss is now solely used to house the cmgs communications equipment and the plasma contactors z1 no longer connects other space station elements to unity node 1 in december 2008 the ad astra rocket company announced an agreement with nasa to place a flight test version of its vasimr ion thruster on the station to take over reboost duties in 2013 ad astra announced specific plans to place the thruster module named aurora on top of the z1 truss in 2015 6 nasa and ad astra signed a contract for development of the vasimr engine for up to three years in 2015 7 this testing of the vx 200sstm vasmir engine for up to 100 hours and 100 kilowatts 8 an example of a spacecraft that used an ion engine to maintain its orbit was the gravity field and steady state ocean circulation explorer whose engine allowed it to maintain a very low orbit play media an animation displaying different views of the z1 truss which was installed on the international space station by the crew of sts 92 this 2001 photo shows the alternate configuration of the truss in which z1 truss was a critical element between the solar arrays and the modules expedition 11 commander sergei k krikalev inside the z1 truss dome s0 truss edit s0 truss the s0 truss also called the center integrated truss assembly starboard 0 truss forms the center backbone of the space station it was attached on the top of the destiny laboratory module during sts 110 in april 2002 s0 is used to route power to the pressurized station modules and conduct heat away from the modules to the s1 and p1 trusses the s0 truss is not docked to the iss but is connected with four module to truss structure mts struts p1 s1 trusses edit s1 truss p1 truss the p1 and s1 trusses also called the port and starboard side thermal radiator trusses are attached to the s0 truss and contain carts to transport the canadarm2 and astronauts to worksites along the space station they each flow of anhydrous ammonia through three heat rejection radiators the s1 truss was launched on sts 112 in october 2002 and the p1 truss was launched on sts 113 in november 2002 detailed design test and construction of the s1 and p1 structures was conducted by mcdonnell douglas now boeing in huntington beach ca first parts were cut for the structure in 1996 and delivery of the first truss occurred in 1999 p2 s2 trusses edit the p2 and s2 trusses were planned as locations for rocket thrusters in the original design for space station freedom since the russian parts of the iss also provided that capability the reboost capability of the space station freedom design was no longer needed at that location so p2 and s2 were canceled 9 p3 p4 s3 s4 truss assemblies edit play media the components and the unfolding of the p3 p4 truss in detail animation p3 p4 truss s3 s4 truss the p3 p4 truss assembly was installed by the space shuttle atlantis sts 115 mission launched september 9 2006 and attached to the p1 segment the p3 and p4 segments together contain a pair of solar arrays a radiator and a rotary joint that will aim the solar arrays and connects p3 to p4 upon its installation no power was flowing across the rotary joint so the electricity generated by the p4 solar array wings was only being used on the p4 segment and not the rest of the station then in december 2006 a major electrical rewiring of the station by sts 116 routed this power to the entire grid the s3 s4 truss mirror image of installed on june 11 2007 also by space shuttle atlantis during flight sts 117 mission 13a and mounted to the s1 truss segment major p3 and s3 subsystems include the segment to segment attach system ssas solar alpha rotary joint sarj and unpressurized cargo carrier attach system uccas the primary functions of the p3 truss segment are to provide mechanical power and data interfaces to payloads attached to the two uccas platforms axial indexing for solar tracking or rotating of the arrays to follow the sun via the sarj movement and work site accommodations for the mobile transporter the p3 s3 primary structure is made of a hexagonal shaped aluminum structure and includes four bulkheads and six longerons 10 the s3 truss also supports express logistics carrier locations first to be launched and installed in the 2009 time frame major subsystems of the p4 and s4 photovoltaic modules pvm include the two solar array wings saw the photovoltaic radiator pvr the alpha joint interface structure ajis and modified rocketdyne truss attachment system mrtas and beta gimbal assembly bga p5 s5 trusses edit p5 truss s5 truss the p5 and s5 trusses are connectors which support the p6 and s6 trusses respectively the p3 p4 and s3 s4 truss assemblies length was limited by the cargo bay capacity of the space shuttle so these small connectors are needed to extend the truss the p5 truss was installed on december 12 2006 during the first eva of mission sts 116 the s5 truss was brought into orbit by mission sts 118 and installed on august 11 2007 p6 s6 trusses edit p6 truss p6 truss after relocation s6 truss the p6 truss was the second truss segment to be added because it contains a large solar array wing saw that generated essential electricity for the station prior to activation of the saw on the p4 truss it was originally mounted to the z1 truss and had its saw extended during sts 97 but the saw was folded one half at a time to make room for the saws on the p4 and s4 trusses during sts 116 and sts 117 respectively shuttle mission sts 120 assembly mission 10a detached the p6 truss from z1 remounted it on the p5 truss redeployed its radiator panels and attempted to redeploy its saws one saw 2b was deployed successfully but the second saw 4b developed a significant tear that temporarily stopped deployment at around 80 this was subsequently fixed and the array is now fully deployed a later assembly mission the out of sequence sts 119 mounted the s6 truss on the s5 truss which provided a fourth and final set of solar arrays and radiators gallery of trusses edit z1 truss above and unity module below from sts 92 in october

assembly far right by sts 120 the space station showing the completed truss assembly as of march 2009 solar arrays edit see also electrical system of the international space station close up view of solar array folded like an accordion the international space station s main source of energy is from three of the four large u s made photovoltaic arrays currently on the station sometimes referred to as the solar array wings saw the first pair of arrays are attached to the p6 truss segment which was launched and installed on top of z1 in late 2000 during sts 97 the p6 segment was relocated to its final position bolted to the p5 truss segment in november 2007 during sts 120 the second pair of arrays was launched and installed in september 2006 during sts 115 but they provide electricity until sts 116 in december 2006 when the station got an electrical rewiring a third pair of arrays was installed during sts 117 in june 2007 a final pair arrived mid march 2009 on sts 119 more solar power was to have been available via the russian built science power platform but it was canceled 10 each of the solar array wings are long by wide and are capable of generating nearly 32.8 kw of dc power 11 they are split into two photovoltaic blankets with the deployment mast in between each blanket has 16,400 silicon photovoltaic cells each cell measuring x grouped into 82 active panels each consisting of 200 cells with 4,100 diodes 10 each pair of blankets is folded like an accordion for compact delivery to space once in orbit the deployment mast between each pair of blankets unfolds the array to its full length gimbals known as the beta gimbal assembly bga are used to rotate the arrays so that they face the sun to provide maximum power to the international space station solar alpha rotary joint edit the alpha joint is the main rotary joint allowing the solar arrays to track the sun in nominal operation the alpha joint rotates by each orbit however see also night glider mode one solar alpha rotary joint sarj is located between the p3 and p4 truss segments and the other is located between the s3 and s4 truss segments when in operation these joints continuously rotate to keep the solar array wings on the outboard truss segments oriented towards the sun each sarj is 10 feet in diameter weighs approximately 2,500 pounds and can be rotated continuously using bearing assemblies and a servo control system on both the port and starboard sides all of the power flows through the utility transfer assembly uta in the sarj roll ring assemblies allow transmission of data and power across the rotating interface so it never has to unwind the sarj was designed built and tested by lockheed martin and its subcontractors 10 the solar alpha rotary joints contain drive lock assemblies which allow the outer segments of the its to rotate and track the sun a component of the dla is a pinion which engages with the race ring that serves as a bull gear there are two race rings and two dlas in each sarj providing on orbit redundancy however a series of space walks would be required to reposition the dlas and the trundle bearing assemblies tbas to utilize the alternate race ring a spare dla was brought to the iss on sts 122 12 in 2007 a problem was detected in the starboard sarj and in one of the two beta gimbal assemblies bga 13 damage had occurred due to excessive and premature wear of a track in the joint mechanism the sarj was frozen during problem diagnosis and in 2008 lubrication was applied to the track to address the issue citation needed power conditioning and storage edit see also electrical system of the international space station the sequential shunt unit ssu is designed to coarsely regulate the solar power collected during periods of the arrays collect power during sun pointing periods a sequence of 82 separate strings or power lines leads from the solar array to the ssu shunting or controlling the output of each string regulates the amount of power transferred the regulated voltage setpoint is controlled by a computer located on the iea and is normally set to around 140 volts the ssu has an overvoltage protection feature to maintain the output voltage below 200 v dc maximum for all operating conditions this power is then passed through the bmrrm to the dcsu located in the iea the ssu measures by by and weighs 185 pounds citation needed the power storage system consists of a battery charge discharge unit bcdu and two battery assemblies citation needed each battery assembly consist of 38 lightweight nickel hydrogen cells and associated electrical and mechanical equipment each battery assembly has a nameplate capacity of 81 ah and 4 kwh 14 this power is fed to the iss via the bcdu and dcsu respectively the batteries have a design life of 6.5 years and can exceed 38,000 charge discharge cycles at 35% depth of discharge each battery measures by by and weighs 375 pounds 15 mobile base system edit main article mobile
