microformatted coordinates place data as rdf the international date line zigzags around the 180th meridian the 180th meridian or antimeridian 1 is the meridian east or west of the prime meridian with which it forms a great circle dividing the earth into the western and eastern hemispheres it is common to both east longitude and west longitude it is used as the basis for the international date line because it mostly passes through the open waters of the pacific ocean however the meridian passes through russia and fiji as well as antarctica starting at the north pole and heading south to the south pole the 180th meridian passes through co ordinates approximate country territory or sea notes 90.000 180.000 arctic ocean arctic ocean 71.533 180.000 russia russia chukotka autonomous okrug

particularly close to the gilbert islands and the phoenix islands of kiribati between north island and the kermadec islands of new zealand between the bounty islands and the chatham islands also of new zealand the only place where roads cross this meridian and where there are buildings very close to it is in fiji software representation problems edit many geographic software libraries or data formats project the world to a rectangle very often this rectangle is split exactly at the 180th meridian this often makes it non trivial to do simple tasks like representing an area or a line over the 180th meridian some examples the geojson specification strongly suggests splitting geometries so that neither of their parts cross the antimeridian 2 in openstreetmap areas like the boundary of russia are split at the 180th meridian see also edit 179th meridian east 179th meridian west prime meridian notes edit the word antimeridian can also mean the meridian opposite to any given meridian e
