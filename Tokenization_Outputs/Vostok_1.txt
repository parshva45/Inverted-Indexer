and the first manned spaceflight in history the vostok 3ka space capsule was launched from baikonur cosmodrome on april 12 1961 with soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin aboard making him the first human to cross into outer space the orbital spaceflight consisted of a single orbit around earth which skimmed the upper atmosphere at 169 kilometers 91 nautical miles at its lowest point the flight took 108

before the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite sputnik 1 in 1957 both countries wanted to develop spaceflight technology quickly particularly by launching the first successful human spaceflight the soviet union secretly pursued the vostok programme in competition with the united states project mercury vostok launched several precursor unmanned missions between may 1960 and march 1961 to test and develop the vostok rocket family and space capsule these missions had varied degrees of success but the final korabl sputnik 4 and korabl sputnik 5 complete successes allowing the first manned flight crew edit see also selection and training of the vostok programme the vostok 1 capsule was designed to carry a single cosmonaut yuri gagarin 27 was chosen as the prime pilot of vostok 1 with gherman titov and grigori nelyubov as backups these assignments were formally made on april 8 four days before the mission but gagarin had been a favourite among the cosmonaut candidates for at least several months 7 262,272 the final decision of who would fly the mission relied heavily on the opinion of the head of cosmonaut training nikolai kamanin in an april 5 diary entry kamanin wrote that he was still undecided between gagarin and titov 8 the only thing that keeps me from picking titov is the need to have the stronger person for the one day flight 9 kamanin was referring to the second mission vostok 2 compared to the relatively short single orbit mission of vostok 1 when gagarin and titov were informed of the decision during a meeting on april 9 gagarin was very happy and titov was disappointed 10 on april 10 this meeting was reenacted in front of television cameras so there would be official footage of the event this included an acceptance speech by gagarin 11 as an indication of the level of secrecy involved one of the other cosmonaut candidates alexei leonov later recalled that he did not know who was chosen for the mission until after the spaceflight had begun 12 medical exam edit gagarin was examined by a team of doctors prior to his flight one doctor gave her recollection of the events in an interview with russia today in april 2011 gagarin looked more pale than usual he was unsociable and quiet which was not like him at all he would answer by nodding or a short yes to all questions sometimes he would start humming some tunes this was a different gagarin we geared him up and hugged and i said yuri everything will be fine and he nodded back 13 preparations edit model of the vostok spacecraft with its upper stage on display in frankfurt airport s russia in space exhibition unlike later vostok missions there were no dedicated tracking ships available to receive signals from the spacecraft instead they relied on the network of ground stations also called command points to communicate with the spacecraft all of these command points were located within the soviet union 14 because of weight constraints there was no backup retrorocket engine the spacecraft carried 10 days of provisions to allow for survival and natural orbital decay in the event the retrorockets failed the letters cccp were hand painted onto helmet by engineer sergeevich lebedev during transfer to the launch site as it had been less than a year since u2 pilot gary powers was shot down lebedev reasoned that without some country identification there was a small chance the cosmonaut might be mistaken for a spy on landing 15 automatic control edit part of the vostok 1 instrument panel prominently displaying the globus navigation instrument the entire mission would be controlled by either automatic systems or by ground control this was because medical staff and spacecraft engineers were unsure how a human might react to weightlessness and therefore it was decided to lock the manual controls in an unusual move a code to unlock the controls was placed in an onboard envelope for use in case of emergency 7 278 prior to the flight kamanin and others told gagarin the code anyway 16 17 april 11 1961 edit electrocardiogram of gagarin recorded april 11 1961 at 19 hours and 35 minutes exhibited at the memorial museum of cosmonautics in moscow at baikonur cosmodrome on the morning of april 11 1961 the vostok k rocket together with the attached vostok 3ka space capsule were transported several kilometers to the launch pad in a horizontal position once they arrived at the launch pad a quick examination of the booster was conducted by technicians to make sure everything was in order when no visible problems were found the booster was erected on lc 1 18 at 10 00 moscow time gagarin and titov were given a final review of the flight plan 18 they were informed that launch was scheduled to occur the following day at 09 07 moscow time this time was chosen so that when the capsule started to fly over africa which was when the retrorockets would need to fire for reentry the solar illumination would be ideal for the orientation sensors 19 at 18 00 once various physiological readings had been taken the doctors instructed the cosmonauts not to discuss the upcoming missions that evening gagarin and titov relaxed by listening to music playing pool and chatting about their childhoods 12 at 21 50 both men were offered sleeping pills to ensure a good sleep but they both declined 20 physicians had attached sensors to the cosmonauts to monitor their condition throughout the night and they believed that both had slept well 21 biographers doran and bizony say that neither gagarin nor titov slept that night 22 korolev sleep that night due to anxiety caused by the imminent spaceflight 19 mission edit at 05 30 moscow time on the morning of april 12 1961 both gagarin and his backup titov were woken 23 they were given breakfast assisted into their spacesuits and then were transported to the launch pad 24 gagarin entered the vostok 1 spacecraft and at 07 10 local time 04 10 utc the radio communication system was turned on 24 once gagarin was in the spacecraft his picture appeared on television screens in the launch control room from an onboard camera launch would not occur for another two hours and during the time gagarin chatted with the main capcom as well as chief designer sergei korolev nikolai kamanin and a few others 24 following a series of tests and checks about forty minutes after gagarin entered the spacecraft its hatch was closed gagarin however reported that the hatch was not sealed properly and technicians spent nearly an hour removing all the screws and sealing the hatch again 2 according to a 2014 obituary chief designer oleg ivanovsky personally helped rebolt the hatch 25 there is some disagreement over whether the hatch was in fact not sealed correctly as a more recent account stated the indication was false citation needed during this time gagarin requested some music to be played over the radio 26 korolev was suffering from chest pains and close to a nervous breakdown citation needed as this was the 24th soviet space launch and the 16th involving a luna vostok booster and to that point 12 launches had failed for a success rate of exactly 50 citation needed two vostoks had failed to reach orbit due to launch vehicle malfunctions and another two malfunctioned in orbit korolev was given a pill to calm him down 27 gagarin on the other hand was described as calm about half an hour before launch his pulse was recorded at 64 beats per minute 28 launch edit launch of vostok 1 poyekhali voice problems playing this file see media help 06 07 ut launch occurred from

template message the vostok 1 capsule on display at the rkk energiya museum at 07 25 ut the automatic systems brought it into the required attitude orientation for the retrorocket firing and shortly afterwards the liquid fueled engine fired for about 42 seconds over the west coast of africa near angola about 8,000 kilometers 4,300 nautical miles uprange of the landing point the perigee and apogee had been selected to cause reentry due to orbital decay within 10 days the limit of the life support system function in the event of retrorocket malfunction however the actual orbit differed from the planned and would not have allowed descent until 20 days 31 ten seconds after retrofire commands were sent to separate the vostok service module from the reentry module code name sharik little ball but the equipment module unexpectedly remained attached to the reentry module by a bundle of wires at around 07 35 ut the two parts of the spacecraft began reentry and went through strong gyrations as vostok 1 neared egypt at this point the wires broke the two modules separated and the descent module settled into the proper reentry attitude gagarin telegraphed everything is ok despite continuing gyrations he later reported that he did not want to make noise as he had correctly reasoned that the gyrations did not endanger the mission and were apparently caused by the spherical shape of the reentry module as gagarin continued his descent he remained conscious as he experienced about 8 g during reentry own report states over 10 g at 07 55 ut when vostok 1 was still from the ground the hatch of the spacecraft was released and two seconds later gagarin was ejected at altitude the main parachute was deployed from the vostok spacecraft two schoolgirls witnessed the vostok landing and described the scene it was a huge ball about two or three meters high it fell then it bounced and then it fell again there was a huge hole where it hit the first time citation needed parachute opened almost right away and about ten minutes later at 08 05 ut gagarin landed both he and the spacecraft landed via parachute south west of engels in the saratov region at 51.270682 45.99727 it was to the west of the planned landing site near baikonur 31 a farmer and her daughter observed the strange scene of a figure in a bright orange suit with a large white helmet landing near them by parachute gagarin later recalled when they saw me in my space suit and the parachute dragging alongside as i walked they started to back away in fear i told them be afraid i am a soviet citizen like you who has descended from space and i must find a telephone to call moscow reactions and legacy edit soviet reaction edit flight was announced on the soviet radio by yuri levitan the speaker who had announced all major events in the great patriotic war as with all previous and most subsequent soviet rocket launches the flight preparation was kept secret and the news was aired only post factum the flight was celebrated as a great triumph of the soviet science and technology demonstrating the superiority of the socialist system over capitalism moscow and other cities in the ussr held mass demonstrations the scale of which was comparable to world war ii victory parades gagarin was awarded the title of hero of the soviet union the highest honour he also became an international celebrity with numerous honours and awards 32 april 12 was declared cosmonautics day in the ussr and is celebrated today in russia as one of the official commemorative dates of russia 33 in 2011 it was declared the international day of human space flight by the united nations 34 informal reply poyekhali became a historical phrase used to refer to the arrival of the space age in human history 35 later it was included in the refrain of a soviet patriotic song written by alexandra pakhmutova and nikolai dobronravov he said go he waved his hand 36 the soviet press later reported that minutes before boarding the spacecraft gagarin made a speech dear friends you who are close to me and you whom i do not know fellow russians and people of all countries and all continents in a few minutes a powerful space vehicle will carry me into the distant realm of space what can i tell you in these last minutes before the launch my whole life appears to me as one beautiful moment all that i previously lived through and did was lived through and done for the sake of this moment according to historian asif siddiqi gagarin actually was essentially forced to utter a stream of banalities prepared by anonymous speechwriters taped much earlier in moscow 7 274 american reaction edit officially the u s congratulated the soviet union on its accomplishments 37 writing for the new york times shortly after the flight however journalist arthur krock described mixed feelings in the united states due to fears of the potential military implications for the cold war 38 and the detroit free press wrote that the people of washington london paris and all points between might have been dancing in the streets if it were not for doubts and suspicions about soviet intentions 39 other us writers reported worries that the spaceflight had won a propaganda victory on behalf of communism 40 41 president john f kennedy was quoted as saying that it would be some time before the us could match the soviet launch vehicle technology and that the news will be worse before better 40 kennedy also sent congratulations to the soviet union for their outstanding technical achievement 40 opinion pages of many us newspapers urged renewed efforts to overtake the soviet scientific accomplishments 39 adlai stevenson then the us ambassador to the united nations was quoted as saying now that the soviet scientists have put a man into space and brought him back alive i hope they will also help to bring the united nations back alive 39 and on a more serious note urged international agreements covering the use of space 39 which did not occur until the outer space treaty of 1967 other world reactions edit prime minister jawaharlal nehru of india praised the soviet union for a great victory of man over the forces of nature 40 and urged that it be considered as a victory for peace 39 the economist voiced worries that orbital platforms might be used for surprise nuclear attacks 39 the svenska dagbladet in sweden chided free countries for splitting up and frittering away their resources 39 while west germany s die welt argued that america had the resources to have sent a man into space first but was beaten by soviet purposefulness 39 yomiuri shimbun urged that both the united states and the soviet union should use their new knowledge and techniques for the good of mankind 39 and egypt s akhbar el yom likewise expressed hopes that the cold war would turn into a peaceful race in infinite space and turn away from armed conflicts such as the laotian civil war 39 world record edit the fai rules in 1961 required that a pilot must land with the spacecraft to be considered an official spaceflight for the fai record books 7 283 although some contemporary soviet sources stated that gagarin had parachuted separately to the ground 42 the soviet union officially insisted that he had landed with the vostok the government forced the cosmonaut to lie in press conferences and the fai certified the flight the soviet union did not admit until 1971 that gagarin had ejected and landed separately from the vostok descent module 7 283 when soviet officials filled out the fai papers to register the flight of vostok 1 they stated that the launch site was baykonur at 47.36667 65.48333 in reality the launch site was near tyuratam at 45.9202000 63.3423111 to the south west of baykonur they did this to try to keep the location of the space center a secret 7 284 in 1995 russian and kazakh officials renamed tyuratam baikonur legacy edit commemorative monument vostok 1 landing site near engels russia four decades after the flight historian asif azam siddiqi wrote that vostok 1 will undoubtedly remain one of the major milestones in not only the history of space exploration but also the history of the human race itself the fact that this accomplishment was successfully carried out by the soviet union a country completely devastated by war just sixteen years prior makes the achievement even more impressive unlike the united states the ussr had to begin from a position of tremendous disadvantage its industrial infrastructure had been ruined and its technological capabilities were outdated at best a good portion of its land had been devastated by war and it had lost about 25 million citizens but it was the totalitarian state that overwhelmingly took the lead in the space race 7 282 the landing site is now a monument park the central feature in the park is a 25 meter tall monument that consists of a silver metallic rocketship rising on a curved metallic column of flame from a wedge shaped white stone base in front of this is a 3 meter tall white stone statue of yuri gagarin wearing a spacesuit with one arm raised in greeting and the other holding a space helmet 43 44 45 the vostok 1 re entry capsule is now on display at the rkk energiya museum in korolyov near moscow in 2011 documentary film maker christopher riley partnered with european space agency astronaut paolo nespoli to record a new film of what gagarin would have seen of the earth from his spaceship by matching historical audio recordings to video from the international space station following the ground path taken by vostok 1 the resulting film first orbit was released online to celebrate the 50th anniversary of human spaceflight 46 see also edit spaceflight portal soviet
