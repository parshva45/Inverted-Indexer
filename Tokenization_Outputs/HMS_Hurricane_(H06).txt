submarines by reflections from sound waves beamed into the water 6 wartime modifications edit little data on hurricane s modifications during the war has survived although it is known that she had her rear torpedo tubes replaced by a 12 pounder aa gun by october 1940 7 the short range aa armament may have been augmented by two oerlikon guns on the wings of the bridge and the 50 calibre machine gun mounts may have also been replaced by a pair of oerlikons the director control tower and rangefinder above the bridge may have been removed in exchange for a type 271 target indication radar a type 286 short range surface search radar was probably also fitted midway through the war the ship probably also received a hf df radio direction finder mounted on a pole mainmast 3 service edit japura was
