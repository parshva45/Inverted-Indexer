soyuz spacecraft wikipedia soyuz spacecraft from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search for the launch vehicle of the same name see soyuz rocket family soyuz soyuz spacecraft tma version manufacturer rkk energia country of origin soviet union russian federation operator soviet space program roscosmos 1991 onwards applications carry cosmonauts to orbit and back originally intended for soviet moonshot specifications design life up to six months docked to station regime low earth orbit circumlunar spaceflight during early program production status in service first launch soyuz 1 1967 soyuz russian lit union is a series of spacecraft designed for the soviet space program by the korolev design bureau now rkk energia in the 1960s that remains in service today the soyuz succeeded the voskhod spacecraft and was originally built as part of the soviet manned lunar programs the soyuz spacecraft is launched on a soyuz rocket the most frequently used and most reliable launch vehicle in the world to date 1 2 the soyuz rocket design is based on the vostok launcher which in turn was based on the 8k74 or r 7a semyorka a soviet intercontinental ballistic missile all

unmanned and started on november 28 1966 the first soyuz mission with a crew soyuz 1 launched on 23 april 1967 but ended with a crash due to a parachute failure killing cosmonaut vladimir komarov the following flight was unmanned soyuz 3 launched on october 26 1968 became the first successful manned mission the only other flight to suffer a fatal accident soyuz 11 killed its crew of three when the cabin depressurized prematurely just before reentry these were the only humans to date to have died above the line 3 despite these early incidents soyuz is widely considered the safest most cost effective human spaceflight vehicle 4 established by its unparalleled length of operational history 5 6 soyuz spacecraft were used to carry cosmonauts to and from salyut and later mir soviet space stations and are now used for transport to and from the international space station iss at least one soyuz spacecraft is docked to iss at all times for use as an escape craft in the event of an emergency the spacecraft is intended to be replaced by the six person federation spacecraft 7 design edit diagram showing the three elements of the soyuz tma spacecraft a soyuz spacecraft consists of three parts from front to back a spheroid orbital module which provides accommodation for the crew during their mission a small aerodynamic reentry module which returns the crew to earth a cylindrical service module with solar panels attached which contains the instruments and engines the orbital and service modules are single use and are destroyed upon re entry in the atmosphere the orbital and reentry portions are habitable living space soyuz can carry up to three crew members and provide life support for about 30 person days the life support system provides a nitrogen oxygen atmosphere at sea level partial pressures the atmosphere is regenerated through ko 2 cylinders which absorb most of the co 2 and water produced by the crew and regenerates the oxygen and lioh cylinders which absorb leftover co 2 the vehicle is protected during launch by a payload fairing which is jettisoned along with the sas at 2-1/2 minutes into launch it has an automatic docking system the ship can be operated automatically or by a pilot independently of ground control launch escape system edit the vostok spacecraft utilized an ejector seat to bail out the cosmonaut in the event of a low altitude launch failure as well as during reentry however it was likely ineffective in the first 20 seconds after liftoff when the altitude would be too low for the parachute to deploy inspired by the mercury les soviet designers began work on a similar system in 1962 this included developing a complex sensing system to monitor various launch vehicle parameters and trigger an abort if a booster malfunction occurred based on data from r 7 launches over the years engineers developed a list of the most likely failure modes for the vehicle and could narrow down abort conditions to premature separation of a strap on booster low engine thrust loss of combustion chamber pressure or loss of booster guidance the spacecraft abort system sas russian translit sistema avarijnogo spaseniya could also be manually activated from the ground but unlike american spacecraft there was no way for the cosmonauts to trigger it themselves since it turned out to be almost impossible to separate the entire payload shroud from the soyuz service module cleanly the decision was made to have the shroud split between the service module and descent module during an abort four folding stabilizers were added to improve aerodynamic stability during ascent two test runs of the sas were carried out in 1966-67 8 the basic design of the sas has remained almost unchanged in 50 years of use and all soyuz launches carry it the only modification was in 1972 when the aerodynamic fairing over the sas motor nozzles was deleted for weight saving reasons as the redesigned soyuz 7k t spacecraft carried extra life support equipment the unmanned progress resupply ferry has a dummy escape tower and deletes the stabilizer fins from the payload shroud there have been two failed launches of a manned soyuz vehicle soyuz 18-1 in 1975 and soyuz t 10 1 in 1983 but the former was aborted after escape tower jettison the latter successfully rescued the cosmonauts from an on pad fire and explosion of the launch vehicle 9 this is the only time a launch escape tower has been used in an abort with a crew aboard orbital module edit main article orbital module soyuz orbital module the forepart of the spacecraft is the orbital module russian translit bytovoi otsek also known as habitation section it houses all the equipment that will not be needed for reentry such as experiments cameras or cargo the module also contains a toilet docking avionics and communications gear internal volume is 3 living space 3 on the latest soyuz versions since soyuz tm a small window was introduced providing the crew with a forward view a hatch between it and the descent module can be closed so as to isolate it to act as an airlock if needed crew members exiting through its side port near the descent module on the launch pad the crew enter the spacecraft through this port this separation also lets the orbital module be customized to the mission with less risk to the life critical descent module the convention of orientation in a micro g environment differs from that of the descent module as crew members stand or sit with their heads to the docking port also the rescue of the crew whilst on the launch pad or with the sas system is complicated because of the orbital module separation of the orbital module is critical for a safe landing without separation of the orbital module it is not possible for the crew to survive landing in the descent module in view of this the orbital module was separated before the ignition of the return engine until the late 1980s this guaranteed that the descent module and orbital module would be separated before the descent module was placed in a reentry trajectory however after the problematic landing of soyuz tm 5 in september 1988 this procedure was changed and the orbital module is now separated after the return maneuver this change was made as the tm 5 crew could not deorbit for 24 hours after they jettisoned their orbital module which contained their sanitation facilities and the docking collar needed to attach to mir the risk of not being able to separate the orbital module is effectively judged to be less than the risk of needing the facilities in it following a failed deorbit descent module edit main article descent module soyuz descent module the descent module russian translit spuskaemyi apparat also known as a reentry capsule is used for launch and the journey back to earth half of the descent module is covered by a heat resistant covering to protect it during reentry this half faces the earth during re entry it is slowed initially by the atmosphere then by a braking parachute followed by the main parachute which slows the craft for landing at one meter above the ground solid fuel braking engines mounted behind the heat shield are fired to give a soft landing one of the design requirements for the descent module was for it to have the highest possible volumetric efficiency internal volume divided by hull area the best shape for this is a sphere as the pioneering vostok descent module used but such a shape can provide no lift which results in a purely ballistic reentry ballistic reentries are hard on the occupants due to high deceleration and cannot be steered beyond their initial deorbit burn that is why it was decided to go with the headlight shape that the soyuz hemispherical forward area joined by a barely angled seven degrees conical section to a classic spherical section heat shield this shape allows a small amount of lift to be generated due to the unequal weight distribution the nickname was thought up at a time when nearly every headlight was circular the small dimensions of the descent module led to it having only two man crews after the death of the soyuz 11 crew the later soyuz t spacecraft solved this issue internal volume of soyuz sa is 3 3 is usable for crew living space service module edit main article service module soyuz instrumentation propulsion module at the back of the vehicle is the service module russian translit priborno agregatnyi otsek it has a pressurized container shaped like a bulging can instrumentation compartment priborniy otsek that contains systems for temperature control electric power supply long range radio communications radio telemetry and instruments for orientation and control a non pressurized part of the service module propulsion compartment agregatniy otsek contains the main engine and a liquid fuelled propulsion system for maneuvering in orbit and initiating the descent back to earth the ship also has a system of low thrust engines for orientation attached to the intermediate compartment perekhodnoi otsek outside the service module are the sensors for the orientation system and the solar array which is oriented towards the sun by rotating the ship an incomplete separation between the service and reentry modules led to emergency situations during soyuz 5 soyuz tma 10 and soyuz tma 11 which led to an incorrect reentry orientation crew ingress hatch first the failure of several explosive bolts did not cut the connection between the service reentry modules on the latter two flights re entry procedure edit the soyuz uses a method similar to the apollo to deorbit itself the spacecraft is turned engine forward and the main engine is fired for deorbiting fully ahead of its planned landing site this requires the least propellant for re entry the spacecraft travels on an elliptical hohmann orbit to a point where it will be low enough in the atmosphere to re enter early soyuz spacecraft would then have the service and orbital modules detach simultaneously from the descent module as they are connected by tubing and electrical cables to the descent module this would aid in their separation and avoid having the descent module alter its orientation later soyuz spacecraft detached the orbital module before firing the main engine which saved propellant since the soyuz tm 5 landing issue the orbital module is once again detached only after the re enter firing which led to but did not cause emergency situations of soyuz tma 10 and tma 11 the orbital module cannot remain in orbit as an addition to a space station as the airlock hatch between the orbital and reentry modules is a part of the reentry module and the orbital module therefore depressurizes after separation re entry firing is usually done on the dawn side of the earth so that the spacecraft can be seen by recovery helicopters as it descends in the evening twilight illuminated by the sun when it is above the shadow of the earth the soyuz craft is designed to come down on land usually somewhere in the deserts of kazakhstan in central asia this is in contrast to early us manned missions which splashed down in the ocean spacecraft systems edit

craft soyuz 7k would rendezvous with other components 9k and 11k in earth orbit to assemble a lunar excursion vehicle the components being delivered by the proven r 7 rocket first generation edit soyuz 7k ok a spacecraft with an active docking unit soyuz 7k oks for salyut space stations the manned soyuz spacecraft can be classified into design generations soyuz 1 through soyuz 11 were first generation vehicles carrying a crew of up to three without spacesuits and distinguished from those following by their bent solar panels and their use of the igla automatic docking navigation system which required special radar antennas this first generation encompassed the original soyuz 7k ok and the soyuz 7k oks for docking with the salyut 1 space station the probe and drogue docking system permitted internal transfer of cosmonauts from the soyuz to the station the soyuz 7k l1 was designed to launch a crew from the earth to circle the moon and was the primary hope for a soviet circumlunar flight it had several test flights in the zond program from zond 4 to zond 8 which produced multiple failures in the re entry systems the remaining 7k l1s were scrapped the soyuz 7k l3 was designed and developed in parallel to the soyuz 7k l1 but was also scrapped soyuz 1 was plagued with technical issues and cosmonaut vladimir komarov was killed when the spacecraft crashed during its return to earth this was the first in flight fatality in the history of spaceflight the next manned version of the soyuz was the soyuz 7k oks it was designed for space station flights and had a docking port that allowed internal transfer between spacecraft the soyuz 7k oks had two manned flights both in 1971 soyuz 11 the second flight depressurized upon re entry killing its three man crew second generation edit upgraded soyuz 7k t version the second generation called soyuz ferry or soyuz 7k t comprised soyuz 12 through soyuz 40 it was developed out of the military soyuz concepts studied in previous years and was capable of carrying 2 cosmonauts with sokol space suits after the soyuz 11 accident several models were planned but none actually flew in space these versions were named soyuz p soyuz ppk soyuz r soyuz 7k vi and soyuz ois orbital research station the soyuz 7k t a9 version was used for the flights to the military almaz space station soyuz 7k tm was the spacecraft used in the apollo soyuz test project in 1975 which saw the first and only docking of a soyuz spacecraft with an apollo command service module it was also flown in 1976 for the earth science mission
