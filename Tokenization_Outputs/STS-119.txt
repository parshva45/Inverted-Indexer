its orbiter processing facility to the vehicle assembly building on 7 january 2009 10 the payload of the s6 truss segment solar arrays and batteries were delivered to launch pad 39a on 11 january 11 discovery moved to the launch pad 39a on 14 january 2009 the move began at 05 17 est and was completed at 12 16 est 12 the sts 119 crew was at kennedy space center from january 2009 for the terminal countdown demonstration test 13 on january 2009 mission managers met for the program level flight readiness review frr following the frr mission managers recommended evaluating the hydrogen flow control valves on discovery and set a new target launch date of 19 february 2009 14 the type of valve that was an interim concern due to the breakage of one of three flow control valves on the previous flight sts 126 the flow valves of all orbiters were subjected to tests to determine if discovery was safe to fly 15 these valves are used to synchronize the flow of gaseous hydrogen between the external fuel tank and the space shuttle main engines creating an even flow 16 following the testing of the valves mission managers decided to postpone the launch and engineers were asked to replace the suspect flow valves with valves that had less flight time 17 following the replacement of the valves the mission management team gave the approval for launch and scheduled it for 11 march 2009 18 the astronauts arrived at the kennedy space center on 8 march 2009 to prepare for launch the 11 march 2009 launch was scrubbed due to a leak in a liquid hydrogen vent line between the shuttle and the external tank 19 on 15 march 2009 the shuttle successfully lifted off from pad 39a 3 20 the leak problem manifested itself again during sts 127 which led to a thorough test the root cause was found to be a misalignment in the gucp ground umbilical carrier plate which was set right leading to a successful flight attempt planned result turnaround reason decision point weather go notes 1

edit 15 march flight day 1 launch edit space shuttle discovery lifts off from kennedy space center space shuttle discovery launched on time at 19 43 edt without any issues upon initial review of early ascent imagery mission managers did not see anything out of the ordinary with debris at launch we see anything at all in the first quick look noted bill gerstenmaier associate administrator for space operations during the post launch news conference 21 seen a lot of launches commented launch director michael d leinbach during the conference and this was the most visibly beautiful launch ever seen 3 21 after reaching orbit the sts 119 crew got to work on their orbit operations opening the payload bay doors deploying the ku band antenna and activating and checking out the robotic arm 3 20 the crew also downlinked the imagery taken of the external tank separation bat stowaway edit bat clinging to the external tank during the countdown a bat was seen to be resting on the external tank 22 what was originally believed to be a fruit bat was revealed to have been a free tailed bat that clung onto the fuel tank during the launch nasa observers had believed the bat would fly off once the shuttle started to launch but it did not and it was probably shaken off and incinerated by the rocket exhaust a bat doctor analyzing pictures believed the bat had a broken wing which made it unable to fly off 23 16 march flight day 2 edit following the wakeup call the members of sts 119 set to work on the task of inspecting thermal protection system 24 25 using the robotic arm and the orbiter boom sensor system obss the crew performed the five hour inspection and the images and video from the survey would be reviewed by the image analysis team on the ground 24 in preparation for docking with the space station on flight day three the crew performed a checkout of the spacesuits that would be used during the mission as well as extending the ring of the orbital docking system and installing the docking centerline camera 24 initial review of the flight ascent imagery indicated no major problems with foam loss or debris strikes to the orbiter during the mission management team briefing chairman leroy cain noted that the launch was picture perfect and the orbiter was in excellent condition 26 cain also noted that after an initial review of the telemetry from the launch the hydrogen flow control valves performed as expected with no issues seen 26 17 march flight day 3 edit the crew of discovery got to work in the morning preparing for rendezvous and docking with the space station 27 28 29 after performing the rendezvous pitch maneuver rpm to allow the expedition 18 crew to photograph the underside of the orbiter discovery successfully docked with the station at 21 20 utc 27 following hatch leak checks the hatches were opened at 23 09 utc 27 after greeting each other the crews had a mandatory station safety briefing and then set to work with initial transfers including the exchange of magnus soyuz seat liner for the swap of the seat liners marked wakata officially joining the expedition 18 crew as flight engineer and magnus became a mission specialist for sts 119 27 28 29 during the mission status briefing lead flight director paul dye commended archambault on a picture perfect docking 29 dye said that no major issues or anomalies were being tracked but noted that the image analysis team was still working on ascent imagery and would be reviewing the rpm imagery before making a decision as to whether discovery would require a focused inspection 29 18 march flight day 4 edit the handover of the s6 truss truss segment mission specialist arnold during his first spacewalk following the post sleep activities the two crews set to work preparing for the next spacewalk by moving the s6 truss out of payload bay due to clearance restrictions the robotic arm was not able to perform the move by itself so a series of handoffs were performed to prepare the truss for installation 30 phillips and magnus controlled the arm grappled the truss and moved it into a position where the robotic arm operated by antonelli could take possession 30 the station arm was then moved along the mobile base to a work site on the far right side closer to the installation point the robotic arm then handed the truss back to the arm where it remained overnight 30 31 the crews took part in a media event with channel one news and performed a review of the procedures for the first eva mission specialists swanson and arnold spent the night in the quest airlock camping out in a reduced nitrogen atmosphere a standard procedure designed for spacewalkers to prevent decompression symptoms 31 32 during the mission management team briefing lead iss flight director kwatsi alibaruho noted that the imagery specialists with the damage assessment team had completed the initial review of the launch and flight day 2 photography and a focused inspection of the orbiter would not be required 30 31 19 march flight day 5 spacewalk 1 edit the two crews set to work following their wake up call preparing for the first spacewalk of the mission swanson and arnold exited the quest airlock at 16 22 utc to begin the installation of the s6 truss segment 33 34 once swanson and arnold were in position phillips and wakata remotely controlled the robotic arm maneuvering the truss into its final position swanson and arnold then bolted the truss into place and connected power and data cables which allowed the ground team to begin remote activation of the segment 34 the two spacewalkers also removed launch locks stowed a keel pin removed and jettisoned four thermal covers and deployed the blanket boxes that hold the solar arrays in place during launch 30 35 the spacewalk ended at 21 11 utc for a total time of 6 hours 7 minutes 30 initially scheduled for flight day 8 managers on the ground decided to move up the deployment of the solar arrays following the decision that a focused inspection would not be required it was decided that the deployment of the arrays would be performed on flight day 6 prior to the second spacewalk in case any issues arose that required a spacewalk to resolve 34 20 march flight day 6 edit on flight day six mission specialist acaba used the ergometer before the crews began deploying the solar arrays the s6 truss solar array unfurled as part of the re planning for the mission the crews set to work in the morning deploying the solar wings on the s6 truss 36 37 to prepare for the extension of the arrays the station was maneuvered into a position that allowed constant sunlight to hit the arrays which allowed them to warm up and prevent what the mission team calls stiction or a sticky friction that happens after the arrays have been in storage for an extended period of time 37 the unfurling of the arrays started at 15 06 utc beginning with the channel 1b array commanding the unit from the station philips paused at the halfway point and allowed the array to rest in the sun for approximately 45 minutes and then completed the extension 38 after successfully extending the 1b array the astronauts started the 3b array extension at 16 35 utc the 3b array was expected to be more difficult to extend as it had been packed in the blanket box for eight years 36 as with the first a pause at halfway was performed to allow the arrays to heat up in the sun while some stiction was seen once the final extension began all the slats flattened out and the arrays were fully deployed at 17 17 utc 38 the addition of the final set of solar panels brings the power output to 120 kilowatts and doubles the scientific power to 30 kilowatts 37 the surface area of the arrays is just under one acre or 38,400 square feet 37 later in the day fincke lonchakov wakata and magnus participated in a media event with reuters voice of america and the pittsburgh post gazette 39 during the mission status briefing alibaruho expressed how pleased the teams on the ground were with the successful deployment of the arrays and commended the crew on the deployment activities 36 mission management team chairman leroy cain noted that the team was working on a revised timetable to allow critical experiment samples to return to earth safely the samples need to be kept in a cold environment and in the event weather delayed the landing the team evaluated the best way to preserve the samples the team approved a revised flight plan that allows discovery to delay hatch closure and undocking slightly to allow the samples to be kept inside the freezer longer while still protecting the landing date of 28 march 36 instead of closing the hatch the night before undocking the hatch would be closed on the same day flight day eleven 36 it was a truly fantastic day in space the international space station team and its partnerships are on cloud nine with the completion of the integrated truss assembly as well as the finalization of our electrical power grid on the space station it took years to get here we had some struggles along the way but a major accomplishment for nasa and the partnership team 36 dan hartman space station
