and final operational shuttle built it embarked on its first mission sts 49 in may 1992 and its 25th and final mission sts 134 in may 2011 1 2 3 sts 134 was expected to be the final mission of the space shuttle program 4 but with the authorization of sts 135 atlantis became the last shuttle to fly the united states congress approved the construction of endeavour in 1987 to replace challenger which was lost in 1986 structural spares built during the construction of discovery and atlantis were used in its assembly nasa chose on cost grounds to build endeavour from spares rather than

ceremony in may 1991 endeavour as photographed from the international space station as it approached the station during sts 118 endeavour appears to straddle the stratosphere and mesosphere in this photo taken from the international space station the orbiter is named after the british hms endeavour the ship which took captain james cook on his first voyage of discovery 5 this is why the name is spelled in the british english manner rather than the american english endeavor this has caused confusion including when nasa itself misspelled a sign on the launch pad in 2007 6 the space shuttle carried a piece of the original wood from ship inside the cockpit 7 the name also honored endeavour the command module of apollo 15 which was also named after ship endeavour was named through a national competition involving students in elementary and secondary schools entries included an essay about the name the story behind it and why it was appropriate for a nasa shuttle and the project that supported the name endeavour was the most popular entry accounting for almost one third of the state level winners the national winners were senatobia middle school in senatobia mississippi in the elementary division and tallulah falls school in tallulah falls georgia in the upper school division they were honored at several ceremonies in washington d c including a white house ceremony where then president george h w bush presented awards to each school 8 endeavour was delivered by rockwell international space transportation systems division in may 1991 and first launched a year later in may 1992 on sts 49 rockwell international claimed that it had made no profit on space shuttle endeavour despite construction costing citation needed service edit on its first mission it captured and redeployed the stranded intelsat vi communications satellite the first african american woman astronaut mae jemison was launched into space on the mission sts 47 on september 12 1992 endeavour flew the first servicing mission sts 61 for the hubble space telescope in 1993 in 1997 it was withdrawn from service for eight months for a retrofit including installation of a new airlock in december 1998 it delivered the unity module to the international space station endeavour s last orbiter major modification period began in december 2003 and ended on october 6 2005 during this time endeavour received major hardware upgrades including a new multi functional electronic display system often referred to as a glass cockpit and an advanced gps receiver along with safety upgrades recommended by the columbia accident investigation board caib for the return to flight following the loss of columbia during reentry on 1 february 2003 the sts 118 mission endeavour s first since the refit included astronaut barbara morgan formerly assigned to the teacher in space project but now a full member of the astronaut corps as part of the crew morgan was the backup for christa mcauliffe

endeavour mounted on a shuttle carrier aircraft endeavour approaches lc 39a before sts 130 endeavour in flight en route back to the kennedy space center atop a shuttle carrier aircraft in 2008 endeavour lands after sts 127 at the kennedy space center shuttle landing facility as it was constructed later endeavour was built with new hardware designed to improve and expand orbiter capabilities most of this equipment was later incorporated into the other three orbiters during out of service major inspection and modification programs endeavour upgrades include a 40 foot diameter drag chute that reduced the rollout distance by 1,000 to 2,000 feet 300 to the plumbing and electrical connections needed for extended duration orbiter edo modifications to allow up to a 28 day mission although a 28 day mission was never attempted the record is 17 days which was set by columbia updated avionics systems that included advanced general purpose computers improved inertial measurement units and tactical air navigation systems enhanced master events controllers and multiplexer demultiplexers a solid state star tracker and improved nose wheel steering mechanisms an improved version of the auxiliary power units apus that provided power to operate the hydraulic systems modifications resulting from a refit of endeavour included the station to shuttle power transfer system sspts which converted 8 kilowatts of dc power from the iss main voltage of 120vdc to the orbiter bus voltage of 28vdc this upgrade allowed endeavour to remain on orbit while docked at iss for an additional 3 to 4 day duration the corresponding power equipment was added to the iss during the sts 116 station assembly mission and endeavour flew with sspts capability during sts 118 11 12 13 final flights edit platforms around endeavour in the orbiter processing facility -2 space shuttle endeavour docked to the iss for the last time endeavour seen at nasa ames on its final flight to california science center endeavour flew its final mission sts 134 to the international space station iss in may 2011 after the conclusion of sts 134 endeavour was formally decommissioned 14 sts 134 was intended to launch in late 2010 but on july 1 nasa released a statement saying the endeavour mission was rescheduled for february 27 2011 15 the target dates were adjusted because critical payload hardware for sts 133 will not be ready in time to support the previously planned 16 september launch nasa said in a statement with the discovery launch moving to november endeavour mission cannot fly as planned so the next available launch window is in february 2011 nasa said adding that the launch dates were subject to change 16 citation needed the launch was further postponed until april to avoid a scheduling conflict with a russian supply vehicle heading for the international space station 17 sts 134 did not launch until 16 may at 08 56 edt 18 endeavour landed at the kennedy space center at 06 34 utc on june 1 2011 completing its final mission 19 it was the 25th night landing of a shuttle 20 21 over its flight career endeavour flew 122,883,151 miles and spent 299 days in space 22 during last mission the russian spacecraft soyuz tma 20 departed from the iss and paused at a distance of 200 meters italian astronaut paolo nespoli took a series of photographs and videos of the iss with endeavour docked 23 this was the second time a shuttle was photographed docked and the first time since 1996 commander mark kelly was the last astronaut off endeavour after the landing and the crew stayed on the landing strip to sign autographs and pose for pictures citation needed sts 134 was the penultimate space shuttle mission sts 135 was added to the schedule in january 2011 and in july atlantis flew for the final time 24 decommissioning edit endeavour mission 26 patch endeavour moving in front of donuts prior to the toyota pull endeavour docked to the international space station on may 23 2011 during its final mission endeavour moving though los angeles with astronauts and sci center director walking in front endeavour on display at the california science center after more than twenty organizations submitted proposals to nasa for the display of an orbiter nasa announced that endeavour would go to the california science center in los angeles 25 26 27 after low level flyovers above nasa and civic landmarks across the country and in california it was delivered to los angeles international airport lax on september 21 2012 28 the orbiter was slowly and carefully transported through the streets of los angeles and inglewood three weeks later from october along la tijera manchester crenshaw and martin luther king jr boulevards to its final destination at the california science center in exposition park 29 30 endeavour encountered a few obstacles while transiting the streets narrowly missing telephone poles apartment buildings and other structures the lack of obstacles was due in part to the fact that over 400 old growth shade trees had been cut down beforehand 31 the power had to be turned off and power carrying poles had to be removed temporarily as the orbiter crept along manchester to prairie avenue then crenshaw boulevard news crews lined the streets along the path with visible news personalities in the news trucks there were several police escorts as well as considerable security helping to control the large crowds gathered endeavour was parked for a few hours at the great western forum where it was available for viewing 32 the journey was famous for an unmodified toyota tundra pickup truck pulling the space shuttle across the manchester boulevard bridge 33 the space shuttle was mainly carried by four self propelled robotic dollies throughout the 12 mile journey however due to bridge weight restrictions the space shuttle was moved onto the dolly towed by the tundra after it had completely crossed the bridge the space shuttle was returned to the robotic dollies the footage was later used in a commercial for the 2013 super bowl 34 having taken longer than expected endeavour finally reached the science center on october 14 35 the exhibit was opened to the public on october 30 2012 at the temporary samuel oschin space shuttle endeavour display pavilion of the museum 32 a new addition to the science center called the samuel oschin air and space center is under construction as permanent home planned for a 2017 opening endeavour will be mounted vertically with an external tank and a pair of solid rocket boosters in the shuttle stack configuration one payload door will be open to reveal a demonstration payload inside 32 after its decommissioning canadarm formally the shuttle remote manipulator system was removed in order to be sent to the canadian space john h chapman space centre in longueuil quebec a suburb of montreal where it was to be placed on display 36 in a canadian poll on which science or aerospace museum should be selected to display the canadarm originally built by spar aerospace the canadian space headquarters placed third to last with only 35 out of 638 votes 37 38 canadarm has since gone on permanent display at the canada aviation and space museum in ottawa 39 40 41 in august 2015 nasa engineers went to work on removing a few of the tanks from endeavour so that they may be used as storage
