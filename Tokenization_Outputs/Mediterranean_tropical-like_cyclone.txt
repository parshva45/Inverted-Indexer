mediterranean tropical like cyclone wikipedia mediterranean tropical like cyclone from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search satellite imagery of a well documented mediterranean tropical like cyclone on 16 january 1995 mediterranean tropical like cyclones sometimes referred to as mediterranean hurricanes or medicanes are rare meteorological phenomena observed in the mediterranean sea due to the dry nature of the mediterranean region formation of tropical cyclones is infrequent with only tropical like storms between 1948 and 2011 no agency however is officially responsible for monitoring the formation and development of medicanes tropical cyclogenesis typically occurs within two separate regions of the sea the first region encompassing areas of the western mediterranean is more conducive for development than the other the ionian sea to the east the rough mountainous geography of the region raises additional difficulties despite being favorable for the development of severe weather and convective activity in general and only with abnormal meteorological circumstances can medicanes form numerous studies have been conducted on the impact of global warming on mediterranean tropical cyclone formation generally concluding that fewer yet more intense storms would form the development of tropical cyclones in the mediterranean sea can usually only occur under somewhat unusual circumstances low wind shear and atmospheric instability induced by incursions of cold air are often required a majority of medicanes are also accompanied by upper level troughs providing energy required for intensifying atmospheric convection heavy precipitation the baroclinic properties of the mediterranean region with high temperature gradients also provides necessary instability for the formation of tropical cyclones another factor rising cool air provides necessary moisture as well warm sea surface temperatures ssts are mostly unnecessary however as most medicanes energy is derived from warmer air temperatures when these favorable circumstances coincide the genesis of warm core mediterranean tropical cyclones often from within existing cut off cold core lows is possible in a conducive environment for formation several notable and damaging medicanes are known to have occurred in september 1969 a north african mediterranean tropical cyclone produced flooding that killed nearly left and crippled local economies a medicane in that developed in the balearic islands region spawned six tornadoes and inundated parts of the islands several medicanes have also been subject to extensive study such as those of and the storm is one of the best studied mediterranean tropical cyclones with its close resemblance to tropical cyclones elsewhere

the satellite analysis branch released information related to a medicane in while it was active it ceased doing so on 2011 2 the mediterranean sea however lies within the greek area of responsibility 3 while france s national serves as a preparation service for the areas as well 4 a majority of mediterranean tropical cyclones form over two separate regions the first more conducive for development than the other encompasses an area of the western mediterranean bordered by the balearic islands southern france and the shorelines of the islands of corsica and sardinia the second identified region of development in the ionian sea between sicily and greece and stretching south to libya is less favorable for tropical cyclogenesis an additional two regions in the aegean and adriatic seas produce fewer medicanes while activity is minimal in the levantine region the geographical distribution of mediterranean tropical cyclones is markedly different than that of other cyclones with the formation of regular cyclones centering on the pyrenees and atlas mountain ranges the gulf of genoa and the island of cyprus in the ionian sea 5 although meteorological factors are most advantageous in the adriatic and aegean seas the closed nature of the geography bordered by land allows little time for further evolution 6 the geography of mountain ranges bordering the mediterranean are conducive for severe weather and thunderstorms with the sloped nature of mountainous regions permitting the development of convective activity 7 although the geography of the mediterranean region as well as its dry air typically prevent the formation of tropical cyclones when certain meteorological circumstances arise difficulties influenced by the geography are overcome 8 the occurrence of tropical cyclones in the mediterranean sea is generally extremely rare with an average of annually and merely occurrences of tropical like storms discovered between 1948 and 2011 in a modern study with no definitive trend in activity in that period 9 few medicanes form during the summer season though activity typically rises in autumn peaks in january and gradually decreases from february to may 5 in the western mediterranean region of development approximately systems form each year compared to the ionian sea region 10 studies have evaluated that global warming can result in higher observed intensities of tropical cyclones as a result of deviations in the surface energy flux and atmospheric composition which both heavily influence the development of medicanes as well in tropical and subtropical areas sea surface temperatures ssts rose within a 50 year period and in the north atlantic and western pacific tropical cyclone basins the potential destructiveness and energy of storms nearly doubled within the same duration evidencing a clear correlation between global warming and tropical cyclone intensities 11 within a similarly recent 20 year period 12 ssts in the mediterranean sea increased by 0.6 to 1.1 to 11 though no observable increase in medicane activity has been noted as of yet 9 in 2006 a computer driven atmospheric model evaluated the future frequency of mediterranean cyclones between 2071 and 2100 projecting a decrease in autumn winter and spring cyclonic activity coinciding with a dramatic increase in formation near cyprus with both scenarios attributed to elevated temperatures as a result of global warming 13 other studies however have been inconclusive forecasting both increases and decreases in duration number and intensity 14 three independent studies using different methodologies and data evaluated that while medicane activity would likely decline with a rate depending on the climate scenario considered a higher percentage of those that formed would be of greater strength 15 16 17 development and characteristics edit a mediterranean tropical cyclone south of italy on 27 october 2005 factors required for the formation of medicanes are somewhat different than that normally expected of tropical cyclones known to emerge over regions with sea surface temperatures ssts below mediterranean tropical cyclones often require incursions of colder air to induce atmospheric instability 5 a majority of medicanes develop above regions of the mediterranean with ssts of 15 to 59 to with the upper bound only found in the southernmost reaches of the sea despite the low sea surface temperatures the instability incited by cold atmospheric air within a baroclinic with high differences in temperature and the formation of medicanes in contrast to tropical areas lacking high baroclinity where raised ssts are needed 18 while significant deviations in air temperature have been noted around the time of mediterranean tropical cyclones formation few anomalies in sea surface temperature coincide with their development indicating that the formation of medicanes is primarily controlled by higher air temperatures not by anomalous ssts 19 similar to tropical cyclones minimal wind shear in wind speed and direction over a well as abundant moisture and vorticity encourages the genesis of tropical cyclone like systems in the mediterranean sea 20 due to the confined character of the mediterranean and the limited capability of heat fluxes the case of medicanes heat cyclones with a diameter larger than cannot exist within the mediterranean 21 despite being a relatively baroclinic area with high temperature gradients the primary energy source utilized by mediterranean tropical cyclones is derived from underlying heat sources generated by the presence of a humid environment similar to tropical cyclones elsewhere outside the mediterranean sea 22 in comparison to other tropical cyclone basins the mediterranean sea generally presents a difficult environment for development although the potential energy necessary for development is not abnormally large its atmosphere is characterized by its lack of moisture impeding potential formation the full development of a medicane often necessitates the formation of a large scale baroclinic disturbance transitioning late in its life cycle into a tropical cyclone like system nearly always under the influence of a deep cut off cold core low within the middle to upper troposphere frequently resulting from abnormalities in a wide spreading rossby wave meanders of upper atmospheric winds 23 a weak and disorganized mediterranean tropical cyclone on 28 january 2010 the development of medicanes often results from the vertical shift of air in the troposphere as well resulting in a decrease in its temperature coinciding with an increase in relative humidity creating an environment more conducive for tropical cyclone formation this in turn leads to in an increase in potential energy producing heat induced air sea instability moist air prevents the occurrence of convective downdrafts vertically downward movement of often hinder the inception of tropical cyclones 23 and in such a scenario wind shear remains minimal overall cold core cut off lows serve well for the later formation of compact surface flux influenced warm core lows such as medicanes the regular genesis of cold core upper level lows and the infrequency of mediterranean tropical cyclones however indicate that additional unusual circumstances are involved the emergence of the latter elevated sea surface temperatures contrasting with cold atmospheric air encourage atmospheric instability especially within the troposphere 18 in general most medicanes maintain a radius of 70 to 40 to last between and travel between 700 to 430 to develop an eye for less than and feature wind speeds of up to 24 in addition a majority are characterized on satellite imagery as asymmetric systems with a distinct round eye encircled by atmospheric convection 21 weak rotation similar to that in most tropical cyclones is usually noted in a early stages increasing with intensity 25 medicanes however often have less time to intensify remaining weaker than most north atlantic hurricanes and only persisting for the duration of a few days 26 the maximum achievable intensity of medicanes is equivalent to the lowest classification on the hurricane wind scale while the entire lifetime of a cyclone may encompass several days most will only retain tropical characteristics for less than 27 circumstances sometimes permit the formation of smaller scale medicanes although the required conditions differ even from those needed by other medicanes the development of abnormally small tropical cyclones in the mediterranean usually requires upper level atmospheric cyclones inducing cyclogenesis in the lower atmosphere leading to the formation of warm core lows encouraged by favorable moisture heat and other environmental circumstances 28 mediterranean cyclones have been compared to polar lows storms which typically develop in the far regions of the northern and southern their similarly small size and heat related instability however while medicanes nearly always feature warm core lows polar lows are primarily cold core the prolonged life of medicanes and similarity to polar lows is caused primarily by origins as synoptic scale surface lows and heat related instability 7 heavy precipitation and convection within a developing mediterranean tropical cyclone are usually incited by the approach of an upper level trough elongated area of low air downstream cold air encircling an existing low pressure system after this occurs however a considerable reduction in rainfall rates occurs despite further organization 29 coinciding with a decrease in previously high lightning activity as well 30 although troughs will often accompany medicanes along their track separation eventually occurs usually in the later part of a mediterranean tropical life cycle 29 at the same time moist air saturated and cooled while rising into the atmosphere then encounters the medicane and permits further development and evolution into a tropical cyclone many of these characteristics are also evident in polar lows 31 notable storms and impacts edit september 1969 edit essa 8 visible satellite imagery of the september 1969 cyclone an unusually severe mediterranean tropical cyclone developed on 1969 southeast of malta producing severe flooding 32 steep pressure and temperature gradients above the atlas mountain range were evident on a result of cool sea air attempting to penetrate inland south of the mountains a lee low pressure area in a mountainous under the influence of mountainous terrain the low initially meandered northeastward following the entry of cool sea air however it recurved to the southeast before transitioning into a saharan depression associated with a distinct cold front by along the path desert air moved northward while cold air drifted in the opposite direction and in northern libya warm arid air clashed with the cooler levant of the mediterranean the organization of the disturbance improved slightly further before emerging into the mediterranean sea on upon which the system experienced immediate cyclogenesis 33 rapidly intensifying while southeast of malta as a cold core cut off low 34 and acquiring tropical characteristics 32 in western africa meanwhile several disturbances converged toward mauritania and algeria while the medicane recurved southwestward back toward the coast losing its closed circulation and later dissipating 34 the cyclone produced severe flooding throughout regions of northern africa malta received upward of of rainfall on sfax measured on tizi ouzou collected on gafsa received and istanbul measured on cap bengut collected on and biskra received on 35 in malta a 20000 ton tanker struck a reef and split in two while in gafsa tunisia the cyclone flooded phosphate mines leaving over unemployed and costing the government over per week thousands of camels and snakes drowned by flood waters were swept out to sea and massive roman bridges which withstood all floods since the fall of the roman empire collapsed in all the floods in tunisia and algeria killed almost left and severely damaged regional economies 36 due to communication problems however flood relief funds and television appeals were not set up until nearly a month later 35 january 1982 edit noaa 7 visible satellite imagery of a mediterranean tropical storm at 1236 utc on 26 january 1982 the unusual mediterranean tropical storm of was first detected in waters north of libya 32 the storm likely reached the atlas mountain range as a low pressure area by 1982 reinforced by an elongated slowly drifting trough above the iberian peninsula eventually a closed circulation center developed by 1310 utc 37 over parts of the mediterranean with sea surface temperatures ssts of approximately and air temperature of 38 a hook shaped cloud developed within the system shortly thereafter rotating as it elongated into a comma shaped apparatus after looping around sicily it drifted eastward between the island and peloponnese recurving on its track again 39 exhibiting clearly curved spiral banding before shrinking slightly 40 the cyclone reached its peak intensity at on the following day maintaining an atmospheric pressure of 992 mbar 29.30 inhg and was succeeded by a period of gradual weakening with the pressure eventually rising to the system slightly reintensified however for a six hour period on ship reports indicated winds of or 50.2 kt were present in the cyclone at the time tropical storm force winds on the hurricane wind scale 37 likely near the eyewall of the cyclone which features the highest winds in a tropical cyclone 38 the global weather cyclone weather center of the united states air force usaf initiated mediterranean cyclone advisories on the cyclone at six hour intervals starting at on until on the following day 41 convection was most intense in the eastern sector of the cyclone as it drifted east northeastward on infrared satellite imagery the eye itself was in diameter 38 contracting to just 28 kilometres one day prior to making landfall 41 the cyclone passed by malta italy and greece before dissipating several days later in the extreme eastern mediterranean observations related to the cyclone however were inadequate and although the system maintained numerous tropical characteristics it is possible it was merely a compact but powerful extratropical cyclone exhibiting a clear eye spiral banding towering cumulonimbi and high surface winds along the eyewall 32 january 1995 edit the 1995 medicane at 1015 utc on shortly after tropical cyclogenesis among numerous documented medicanes the cyclone of is generally considered to be the best documented instance emerging off of the libyan coast into the central mediterranean sea toward the ionian shoreline of greece on as a compact low pressure area the precursor low maintained winds reaching up to as it traversed the ionian sea 42 while the german research ship meteor noted winds of 43 upon the approach near greece it began to envelop an area of atmospheric convection meanwhile in the middle troposphere a trough extended from russia to the mediterranean bringing with it extremely cold temperatures 44 two low pressure areas were present along the path of the trough with one situated above ukraine and the other above the central mediterranean likely associated with a low level cyclone over western greece upon weakening and dissipation on a second low the system which would evolve into the mediterranean tropical cyclone developed in its place on 43 at the time of formation high clouds indicated the presence of intense convection 43 and the cyclone featured an axisymmetric cloud structure with a distinct cloud free eye and rainbands spiraling around the disturbance as a whole 45 soon thereafter the parent low separated from the medicane entirely and continued eastward 44 meandering toward the aegean sea and turkey 42 initially remaining stationary between greece and sicily with a minimum atmospheric pressure of 1002 mbar 29.59 inhg the newly formed system began to drift southwest to south in the following days influenced by northeasterly flow incited by the initial low now far to the east and a high pressure area above central and eastern europe 44 the atmospheric pressure increased throughout due to the fact it was embedded within a large scale environment with its rising pressure due to the general prevalence of higher air pressures throughout the region and was not a sign of deintensification 45 initial wind speeds within the young medicane were generally low with sustained winds of merely 28 to 17 to with the highest recorded value associated with the disturbance being at on slightly below the threshold for tropical storm on the hurricane wind scale its structure now consisted of a distinct eye encircled by counterclockwise rotating cumulonimbi with cloud top temperatures colder than evidencing deep convection and a regular feature observed in most tropical cyclones 46 at 1200 utc on 16 january a ship recorded winds blowing east southeast of about 50 knots south southwest about north northeast of the center 47 intense convection continued to follow the entire path of the system as it traversed the mediterranean and the cyclone made landfall in northern libya at approximately 1800 utc on rapidly weakening after coming ashore 44 as it moved inland a minimum atmospheric pressure of was recorded accompanied by wind speeds of as it slowed down after passing through the gulf of sidra 48 although the system retained its strong convection for several more hours the cloud tops began to warm evidencing lower clouds before losing tropical characteristics entirely on 49 offshore ship reports recorded that the medicane produced intense winds copious rainfall and abnormally warm temperatures 50 september and october 1996 edit the last major mediterranean tropical cyclone of 1996 while west of italy on three notable medicanes developed in 1996 the first in was a typical mediterranean tropical cyclone that developed in the balearic islands region 51 at the time of the formation a powerful atlantic cold front and a warm front associated with a large scale low producing northeasterly winds over the iberian peninsula extended eastward into the mediterranean while abundant moisture gathered in the lower troposphere over the balearic channel 52 on the morning of a disturbance developed off of valencia spain dropping heavy rainfall on the coast even without coming ashore an eye developed shortly thereafter as the system rapidly traversed across majorca and sardinia in its eastward trek it made landfall upon the coast of southern italy on the evening of with a minimum atmospheric pressure of dissipating shortly after coming ashore 53 with a diameter of about 28 at valencia and other regions of eastern spain the storm generated heavy precipitation while six tornadoes touched down over the balearic islands while approaching the coast of the balearic islands the warm core low induced a pressure drop of at palma majorca in advance of the tropical landfall medicanes as small as the one that formed in are atypical and often require circumstances different even from those required for regular mediterranean tropical cyclone formation 28 warm low level advection of heat through air or by a large scale low over the western mediterranean was a primary factor in the rise of strong convection 7 the presence of a mid to upper level cut off cold core low a method of formation typical to medicanes was also key to the development of intense thunderstorms within the cyclone in addition interaction between a northeastward drifting trough the medicane and the large scale also permitted the formation of tornadoes within thunderstorms generated by the cyclone after making landfall 54 the second of the three recorded mediterranean tropical cyclones in 1996 formed between sicily and tunisia on making landfall on both sicily and southern italy the medicane generated major flooding in sicily meanwhile in calabria wind gusts of up to were reported in addition to severe inundation 32 the third major mediterranean tropical cyclone of that year formed north of algeria and strengthened while sweeping between the balearic islands and sardinia with an eye like feature prominent on satellite the eye was distorted and disappeared after transiting over southern sardinia throughout the evening of with the system weakening as a whole on the morning of a smaller eye emerged as the system passed over the tyrrhenian sea gradually strengthening with reports from the center reporting winds of extreme damage was reported in the aeolian islands after the tropical cyclone passed north of sicily though the system dissipated while turning southward over calabria overall the lowest estimated atmospheric pressure in the third medicane was 55 both october systems featured distinctive spiral bands intense convection high sustained winds and abundant precipitation 32 september 2006 edit the mediterranean tropical cyclone of 26 september 2006 a short lived medicane developed near the end of along the coast of italy the origins of the medicane can be traced to the alpine atlas mountain range on the evening of 51 likely forming as a normal lee cyclone 56 at 0600 utc on european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf model analyses indicated the existence of two low pressure areas along the shoreline of italy one on the west coast sweeping eastward across the tyrrhenian sea while the other slightly more intense low was located over the ionian sea 57 as the latter low approached the strait of sicily it met an eastward moving convection producing cold front resulting in significant intensification while the system simultaneously reduced in size 56 it then achieved a minimum atmospheric pressure of approximately 986 mbar 29.12 inhg after transiting north northeastward across the salentine peninsula in the course of roughly at the same day 57 wind gusts surpassing were recorded as it passed over salento due to a steep pressure gradient associated with it confirmed by regional radar observations denoting the presence of a clear eye 57 the high winds inflicted moderate damages throughout the peninsula though specific damage is unknown 51 around 57 both radar and satellite recorded the entry into the adriatic sea and its gradual northwestward curve back toward the italian coast by the cyclone made landfall in northern apulia while maintaining its intensity with a minimum atmospheric pressure at the cyclone weakened while drifting further inland over the italian mainland eventually dissipating as it curved west southwestward a later study in 2008 evaluated that the cyclone possessed numerous characteristics seen in tropical cyclones elsewhere with a spiral appearance eye like apparatus rapid atmospheric pressure decreases in advance of landfall and intense sustained winds concentrated near the eyewall 58 the apparent eye like structure in the cyclone however was ill defined 50 since then the medicane has been the subject of significant study as a result of the availability of scientific observations and reports related to the cyclone 57 in particular the sensitivity of this cyclone to sea surface temperatures 59 initial conditions the model 60 and the parameterization schemes used in the simulations were analyzed 61 the relevance of different instability indices for the diagnosis and the prediction of these events were also studied 62 november 2011 rolf 01m edit tropical storm rolf at peak intensity on 8 november 2011 in the first officially designated mediterranean tropical cyclone by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa formed christened as 01m by the satellite analysis branch and given the name rolf by the free university of berlin fu berlin 2 63 despite the fact that no agency is officially responsible for monitoring tropical cyclone activity in the mediterranean 1 on 2011 a frontal system associated with another low pressure area monitored by fu berlin designated quinn spawned a second low pressure system inland near marseille which was subsequently named rolf by the university an upper level trough on the european mainland stalled as it approached the pyrenees before approaching and interacting with the low known as rolf heavy rainfall consequently fell over regions of southern france and northwestern italy resulting in widespread landslides and flooding on rolf slowed while stationed above the massif central maintaining a pressure of 1000 mbar 29.53 inhg a stationary front stationed between madrid and lisbon approached rolf the same day with the cold front later encountering and become associated with rolf which would continue for several days 63 on the cyclone drifted toward the mediterranean from the southern shoreline of france shrinking to a diameter of merely across slightly weakening rolf neared the balearic islands on associated with two fronts producing heavy rain throughout europe before separating entirely and transitioning into a cut off low 63 the same day the noaa began monitoring the system designating it as 01m marking the first time it officially monitored a medicane a distinct eye like feature developed while spiral banding and intense convection became evident at its highest the dvorak technique classified the system as t3 0 convection gradually decreased and a misalignment of the mid and upper level centers was noted the system continued to rapidly weaken on before advisories were halted on the system later that day 2 and fu berlin followed suit by removing the name rolf from its weather maps and declaring its dissipation 63 the deep warm core of this cyclone persisted for a longer time compared to other tropical like cyclones in the mediterranean 30 november 2014 qendresa edit cyclone qendresa on 7 november main article cyclone qendresa on 6 november 2014 the low level circulation centre of qendresa formed near kerkennah islands 64 as the system was moving north northeastwards and combining with an upper level low from tunisia early on 7 november the system occluded quickly and intensified dramatically with an eye like feature thanks to favourable conditions qendresa directly hit malta when it had lost its fronts with a more well defined eye with ten minute sustained winds at and the gust at 65 the central pressure was presumed to be 978 hpa 28.88 inhg interacting with sicily the cyclone turned northeastwards and started to make an anticlockwise loop on 8 november qendresa crossed syracuse in the morning and then significantly weakened 64 turning southeastwards then moving eastwards 66 qendressa moved over crete before dissipating over the island on november 11 67 october 2016 90m edit 90m on 30 october 2016 on early 28 october 2016 winds began to form into an extratropical cyclone south of calabria in the ionian sea it quickly intensified attaining wind speeds of as it slowly moved to the west causing high waves and minor damage to cars near the maltese city of valletta 68 weakening the following day and beginning to move eastwards however later that day it began to re intensify becoming a tropical storm on 31 october after passing over crete it then began to quickly weaken with the storm degenerating into an extratropical low on 1 november 69 tropical storm 90m was also nicknamed medicane trixi by some media outlets in europe during its duration 70 other storms edit numerous other mediterranean cyclones have occurred but few have been as well documented as those in 1969 1982 1995 1996 2006 2011 and 2014 on 1983 a medicane was observed at sea between tunisia and sicily looping around sardinia and corsica coming ashore twice on the islands before making landfall at tunis early on and dissipating the development of the system was not encouraged by baroclinic instability rather convection was incited by abnormally high sea surface temperatures ssts at the time of its formation it also featured a definitive eye tall cumulonimbus clouds intense sustained winds and a warm core for most of its duration it maintained a diameter of 200 to 120 to though it shrank just before landfall on ajaccio to a diameter of four other notable cyclones occurred in the late twentieth century on and all exhibiting characteristics closely resembling tropical cyclones
