category hurricane andrew hurricane andrew was a category 5 atlantic hurricane that struck the bahamas and florida in mid august 1992 the most destructive hurricane to ever hit the state it was the strongest in decades and the costliest hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the united states until it was surpassed by katrina in 2005 andrew caused major damage in the bahamas and louisiana but the greatest impact was felt in south florida with sustained wind speeds as high as 165 mph 270 km h passing directly through the city of homestead in dade county now known as miami dade county it stripped many homes of all but their concrete foundations in total it destroyed more than 63,500 houses damaged more than 124,000 others caused $26.5 billion in damage nb 1 and left 65 people dead andrew began as a tropical depression over the eastern atlantic ocean on august 16 after spending a week without significantly strengthening itself in the central atlantic it rapidly intensified into a powerful category 5 hurricane while moving westward towards the bahamas on august 23 though it briefly weakened to category 4 while traversing the bahamas it regained its category 5 status before making landfall in florida on elliott key and homestead on august 24 with a barometric pressure of 922 mbar 27.23 inhg at the time of landfall in florida andrew is the fourth most intense hurricane to strike the united states several hours later the hurricane emerged over the gulf of mexico at category 4 strength with the gulf coast of the united states in its path after turning northwestward and weakening further andrew moved ashore near morgan city louisiana as a low end category 3 storm after moving inland the small hurricane curved northeastward and rapidly lost its intensity merging with a frontal system over the southern appalachian mountains on august 28 hurricane andrew first inflicted structural damage as it moved through the bahamas especially in cat cays lashing the islands with storm surge hurricane force winds and tornadoes about 800 houses were destroyed in the archipelago and there was substantial damage to the transport water sanitation agriculture and fishing sectors andrew left four dead and $250 million in damage throughout the bahamas in parts of southern florida andrew produced severe winds a wind gust of 177 mph 282 km h was observed at a house in perrine the cities of florida city homestead and cutler ridge received the brunt of the storm as many as 1.4 million people lost power at the height of the storm in the everglades 70,000 acres 280 km 2 of trees were downed while invasive burmese pythons began inhabiting the region after a nearby facility housing them was destroyed rainfall in florida was substantial peaking at 13.98 inches 355 mm in western dade county in florida andrew killed 44 and left a record $25 billion in damage prior to making landfall in louisiana on august 26 andrew caused extensive damage to oil platforms in the gulf of mexico leading to in losses for oil companies it produced hurricane force winds along its path through louisiana damaging large stretches of power lines that left about 230,000 people without electricity over 80% of trees in the atchafalaya river basin were downed and the agriculture there was devastated throughout the basin and bayou lafourche 187 million freshwater fish were killed in the hurricane with 23,000 houses damaged 985 others destroyed and 1,951 mobile homes demolished property losses in louisiana exceeded $1.5 billion the hurricane caused the deaths of in the state 6 of whom drowned offshore andrew spawned at least 28 tornadoes along the gulf coast especially in alabama georgia and mississippi in total andrew left 65 dead and caused in damage it is currently the fifth costliest

andrew map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the scale a tropical wave moved off the west coast of africa on august 14 a ridge of high pressure to its north caused the wave to move quickly westward an area of convection developed along the wave axis to the south of the cape verde islands and on august 15 meteorologists began classifying the system with the dvorak technique the thunderstorm activity became more concentrated and narrow spiral rainbands began to develop around a center of circulation it is estimated that tropical depression three developed late on august 16 about east southeast of barbados 1 embedded within the deep easterlies the depression tracked west northwestward at 2 initially moderate wind shear prevented strengthening until a decrease in shear allowed the depression to intensify into tropical storm andrew at 12 00 utc on august 17 1 by early august 18 the storm maintained convection near the center with spiral bands to its west as the winds increased to 3 shortly thereafter the storm began weakening because of increased southwesterly wind shear from an upper level low 1 on august 19 a hurricane hunters flight into the storm failed to locate a well defined center 4 and on the following day a flight found that the cyclone had degenerated to the extent that only a diffuse low level circulation center remained observations indicated the barometric pressure rose to an unusually high the flight indicated that andrew maintained a vigorous circulation aloft after the upper level low weakened and split into a trough the wind shear decreased over the storm a strong high pressure cell then developed over the southeastern united states which built eastward and caused andrew to turn to the west 1 convection became more organized as upper level outflow became better established 5 an eye formed and andrew attained hurricane status early on august 22 about east southeast of nassau bahamas 1 in the forecast issued six hours after becoming a hurricane the cyclone was predicted to make landfall near jupiter florida with winds of 105 mph 170 km h on august 25 6 this underestimated both the strength and the speed of the storm which would eventually make landfall in south florida 1 a sequence of satellite images depicting hurricane andrew from right to left on august the hurricane accelerated westward into an area of highly favorable conditions and began to rapidly intensify late on august 22 in a period the atmospheric pressure dropped by to a minimum of 1 on august 23 the storm attained category 5 status on the hurricane scale reaching peak winds of 175 mph 280 km h a short distance off eleuthera island in the bahamas at 18 00 utc nb 2 7 despite its intensity andrew was a small tropical cyclone with winds of extending out only about 90 mi 150 km from the center 8 after reaching that intensity the hurricane underwent an eyewall replacement cycle 9 at 21 00 utc on august 23 andrew made landfall on eleuthera with winds of 7 the cyclone weakened further while crossing the bahama banks and at 01 00 utc on august 24 andrew hit the southern berry islands of the bahamas with winds of 7 as it crossed over the warm waters of the gulf stream the hurricane rapidly re intensified as the eye decreased in size and its eyewall convection deepened 1 at 08 40 utc on august 24 andrew struck elliott key with winds of and a pressure of about after its first florida landfall andrew hit just northeast of homestead with a slightly lower pressure of 7 this barometric pressure made andrew the most intense hurricane to

eyewall temperature than two hours prior however andrew weakened as it continued further inland and after crossing southern florida in four hours the storm emerged into the gulf of mexico with winds of 130 mph 210 km h 1 in the gulf of mexico the eye remained well defined as the hurricane turned to the west northwest a change due to the weakening of the ridge to its north 12 andrew steadily re intensified over the gulf of mexico reaching winds of 145 mph 235 km h late on august 25 7 as the high pressure system to its north weakened a strong mid latitude trough approached the area from the northwest this caused the hurricane to decelerate to the northwest and winds decreased as andrew approached the gulf coast of the united states 1 at 08 30 utc on august 26 the cyclone made landfall about 20 mi 30 km west southwest of morgan city louisiana with winds of 7 andrew weakened rapidly as it turned to the north and northeast falling to tropical storm intensity within 10 hours after entering mississippi the cyclone deteriorated to tropical depression status early on august 27 accelerating northeastward the depression began merging with the approaching frontal system and by midday on august 28 andrew merged with a frontal system while located over the southern appalachian mountains 1 the remnants continued moving towards the northeast and it lost its identity later that day merging with the remnants of hurricane lester and a frontal zone over the mid atlantic 13 post analysis on andrew revealed that the storm was often stronger than operationally reported between early on august 22 and early on august 26 in real time the national hurricane center assessed its peak intensity as 14 which was upgraded to 155 mph 250 km h in a post storm analysis after the season ended 1 however a 2004 paper by christopher landsea and others concluded that andrew became a category 5 hurricane near the bahamas on august 23 and reached maximum sustained winds of 175 mph 280 km h the paper also indicated that andrew briefly re intensified into a category 5 hurricane around the time of landfall in south florida early on august 24 the storm was found to have been slightly stronger while approaching louisiana but the landfall winds were decreased from 120 mph 195 km h to 115 mph 185 km h 7 preparations edit visual comparison of hurricane floyd and hurricane andrew while at

sarasota counties a total of opened in these counties and collectively housed at least 20 in dade county alone were ordered to evacuate 21 as andrew was approaching an estimated were in the florida keys monroe county 22 overall almost people evacuated which contributed to the low number of fatalities despite the intensity of the storm 1 many evacuees also checked into hotels with rooms completely booked as far north as ocala ultimately the sheer number of evacuees led to likely the largest traffic jam in the history of florida mostly along interstate 95 united states coast guard vessels on or near the florida coastline were either secured onshore or sent to ride out the storm at sea 23 government offices and public and private schools were closed from monroe county northward

to eventually include areas from mobile alabama to freeport texas all watches and warnings on the gulf coast were discontinued late on august 26 after the hurricane moved inland over louisiana 1 due to the threat workers fled oil platforms in the gulf of mexico while the coast guard moved their boats inland 27 officials in mississippi suggested that about evacuate the coastal counties 28 shelters

fatalities while indirectly caused by the storm it was later noted that if andrew had been slightly larger or had made landfall a few miles further north it would have significantly affected miami and fort lauderdale which would have resulted in an even higher damage and death toll 1 an analysis by the american meteorological society indicated that unlike most hurricanes wind damage from andrew was mostly north of the geometric center and occurred primarily on the eastern edge of the storm 50 some officials in florida considered andrew the worst storm in the state since the labor day hurricane in 1935 51 the storm surge from andrew caused more than in losses to boats and buildings 1 52 at the height of the storm more than people lost electricity and another without telephone service 53 it

generally between 4 to 1.2 to above normal in the biscayne bay area though near the burger king international headquarters tides reached as high as above normal storm surge on the west coast was widespread but generally light with a peak height of in everglades city and goodland strong winds from the storm were confined to a relatively small area stretching from key largo to the miami beach area a house near perrine initially reported a wind gust of before the structure and instrument were destroyed this measurement was reduced to after wind tunnel testing at the virginia polytechnic institute and state university of the same type of anemometer revealed a 16.5% error several other anemometers measuring the highest wind speeds on land were destroyed or failed at the national hurricane center building in coral gables sustained winds of and gusts to were measured before the anemometer failed the highest sustained wind speed for the storm was recorded at the turkey point nuclear generating station before instruments also failed there in key largo a 13 minute wind speed of was reported tropical storm force winds reached as far north as west palm beach on the west coast of florida sustained winds remained just below tropical storm force on marco island though a wind gust of was reported in collier county rainfall was generally light possibly as a result of the relatively fast movement 1 overall precipitation from andrew peaked at nearly in western dade county heavy rainfall in other areas was sporadic with precipitation reported as far north as central florida 13 damage in lakes by the bay although effects from andrew were catastrophic the extent of damage was limited mainly from kendall to key largo due to the small wind field of the storm the hurricane destroyed 90% of mobile homes in the county including 99% of mobile homes in homestead 1 at the homestead air force base most of the on the base were severely damaged or rendered unusable 56 damage to the base was extensive enough that it was recommended for closure 57 nearby in the small town of florida city over were demolished and were damaged while a number of other buildings were damaged beyond repair including city hall 58 further north damage to poorly constructed homes in communities such as country walk and saga bay resembled that of an f3 tornado as winds in the area were estimated to have ranged from 130 to 210 to below the threshold for an f3 tornado 59 four of the five condominiums at naranja lakes were destroyed 60 the cutler ridge mall suffered severe wind and

which was the most costly disaster aid package at the time was passed by congress as house on 86 and signed into law by president bush on 87 the state of florida alone received through the disaster relief bill 88 the federal emergency management agency fema was criticized for its slow response in both florida and louisiana even a month prior to andrew the house committee on appropriations which oversees the budget for fema released a report calling the agency a political dumping ground and a turkey farm due to its weak inexperienced leaders congressman s william green of new york a member of the appropriations committee stated that he believed the agency learned little from its botched response to hurricane hugo in 1989 however green also criticized local officials for expecting them fema to come and run the whole show some fema officials responded that it was impossible to respond as they had been requested while also continuing to provide aid for the los angeles riots fema spokesman

legislature to raise taxes stating that no matter how much congress appropriates to repair damage from hurricane andrew the state will face a substantial cleanup bill 85 instead of raising taxes chiles signed a bill into law on that created a three year reserve fund for losses to uninsured businesses and homes as well as government and school buildings and functions additionally the bill allowed south floridians to keep an estimated in sales tax generated by rebuilding efforts 92 clean up after hurricane andrew in dade county crime especially looting and theft rose sharply in the areas south of miami immediately after andrew reports indicate that merchandise was stolen at damaged or destroyed shopping centers in southern dade county additionally looting occurred in neighborhoods severely affected by the storm even in homes where few possessions remained 60 93 initially the slow response of federal aid prompted dade county emergency management director kate hale to famously exclaim at a nationally televised news conference where in the hell is the cavalry on this one they keep saying going to get supplies for sake where are they almost immediately president bush promised help is on the way and mobile kitchens food and tents along with over 20,000 units from the florida army national guard 124th infantry regiment from florida the 24th infantry division from fort stewart the 82nd airborne division in fort bragg and the 10th mountain division from fort drum 94 95 in order to provide temporary housing for the homeless military personnel initially set up a total of five tent cities in florida city and homestead 96 while a sixth tent city was opened at the miccosukee indian reservation shortly after labor day weekend 97 the government of canada dispatched a team 90 military engineers to repair community centers hospitals and schools additionally a crew of personnel were sent to miami via the hmcs protecteur to assist american relief teams 98 the storm struck florida in the midst of 1992 presidential election campaign a poll conducted by cbs news in september showed that 65% of dade county residents approved of handling of the disaster while 61% of residents approved statewide despite the support of response and his proposal to rebuild homestead air force base he benefited little politically and trailed against bill clinton in another poll taken in september additionally 75% of voters in dade county and 82% of floridians overall stated that the actions in response to andrew would not impact their vote in november 99 bush went on to carry the state of florida but by a margin of only 1.89 100 the hurricane also impacted governor chiles politically the response to the storm was perceived as poor sinking chiles approval rating to 22 while his disapproval rating rose to 76 however chiles was able to recover prior to the 1994 gubernatorial election 101 in the aftermath of the storm extensive psychological effects were documented difficulty during clean up and recovery lead to increased divorce rates and a spike in posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd the cases of ptsd primarily impacted children a sampling of by the university of south carolina s department of epidemiology and biostatistics indicated that 3% of males and 9% of females met the criteria for ptsd 102 dozens of children in the area attempted suicide while counselors reported that between 50 and discussed killing themselves between and 103 a panel of psychiatrists and psychologists at the university of miami agreed that as many as 90% of residents in the worst impacted areas would experience at least a few symptoms of ptsd 104 within six months the circumstances related to the aftermath of andrew led to at least five suicides and four homicides 105 a home destroyed by the storm although proposals to rebuild homestead air force base were initially rejected 57 the united states department of defense eventually expended over to begin repairs unsalvageable buildings were demolished reconstruction then began on a florida air national guard tower air traffic control tower and maintenance hangars next the rebuilding of communications medical security facility vehicle maintenance and wing headquarters buildings began on 1994 the base reopened as homestead air reserve base 106 prior to andrew the base employed approximately personnel and and annually added about to the local economy 107 108 after its reopening major bobby expected the base to annually contribute less than half of that between and 108 the city of homestead spent about on rebuilding the homestead sports complex despite this the cleveland indians fearing the relocation of their more affluent fans moved their spring training location to chain of lakes park in winter haven 109 110 as homes were being rebuilt fema provided free temporary mobile homes for and financial assistance to more than families for staying in hotel rooms paying rent and repairing homes 111 nearly two years after andrew about 70% of homes in homestead that were damaged or destroyed were repaired or rebuilt additionally of the homes destroyed or severely damaged throughout dade county been restored by july 1994 112 more than in south florida lost coverage after companies went bankrupt caused by more than claims filed this led the florida legislature to create new entities such as the joint underwriting association the florida windstorm underwriting association and the florida hurricane catastrophe fund in an effort to restore adequate insurance capacity 113 stricter building codes were created in florida in the aftermath of hurricane andrew a survey by tim marshall and richard herzog of the haag engineer company in carrollton texas highlighted several construction issues on the roof of some homes the concrete tiles were glued to felt paper which could easily be ripped by straight line winds at houses with shingled roofs it was found that some of the shingles were stapled perpendicular to the long axis also allowing them to be torn away after the tiles or shingles were peeled off the plywood and prefabricated trusses were exposed to the weather eventually the plywood and the trusses suffered structural failure leading to roof collapses 114 tent cities were constructed to house displaced residents in governor chiles established the florida building codes study commission with the purpose of assessing the building codes at the time as well as enacting improvements and reform to the system the commission study indicated that building codes and regulations were developed amended and administered by over jurisdictions and state agencies 115 the florida building code was established in 1998 and put into effect by 2002 116 it phased out local laws and regulations and replaced them with universal statewide building codes after hurricanes charley frances ivan and jeanne in 2004 a study conducted by the university of florida in the following year noted that homes built under the new florida building code that became effective in 2002 sustained less damage on average than those built between 1994 and 2001 a report by the florida legislature in 2006 after hurricanes dennis katrina and wilma in 2005 came to a similar conclusion indicating that they added further evidence that the florida building code is working 117 the hurricane also transformed the demographics of dade county a migration of mostly white families northward to broward and palm beach county was ongoing but accelerated after andrew 118 many of these families had used the money they received from insurance claims to relocate 119 the population growth was especially noticeable in southwestern broward county where land development was pushed years ahead of schedule 118 similar migration occurred within the jewish community although there are areas of dade county that still have significant jewish populations many jews resettled to coral springs west fort lauderdale hallandale beach plantation and tamarac in broward county and boca raton and west palm beach in palm beach county 120 the county had a net loss of about in 1992 while broward and palm beach counties gained about 17,000 and county residents respectively 109 by 2001 had moved from dade county to broward county while county residents had moved to palm beach county however as broward county became more crowded relocated from broward county to palm beach county 121 consequently the hispanic population in south dade county climbed rapidly 119 in homestead for example the latino population increased from 30% to 45% between 1990 and 2000 122 during the storm a facility housing burmese pythons was destroyed allowing many of them to escape into the everglades although burmese pythons native to southeast asia had been sighted in everglades national park since the 1980s the destruction of this facility contributed significantly to the establishment of breeding populations in florida due to rapid reproduction and ability to prey on many species 123 the population of burmese pythons exploded with possibly as many as 300,000 in the everglades alone 124 efforts have been made to curb the thriving population of these invasive snakes including a ban on importation of the species to the united states since and increased regulations on ownership of a boa constrictor or python 125 126 louisiana edit on august 26 george h w bush toured devastated areas of louisiana with governor edwin edwards 127 president bush remarked the destruction from this storm goes beyond anything we have known in recent years but noted that damage was less severe than in florida after his visit to louisiana president bush declared only terrebonne parish as a disaster area 72 but later included 34 other parishes under this declaration 128 fema initially opened five field offices throughout louisiana these centers allowed residents to submit applications for aid 129 after franklin mayor sam jones and congressman billy tauzin criticized fema for failing to open a field office in franklin fema promised to do so in the first few days following the storm louisiana national guard members and local residents worked to remove debris such as downed trees roofing shingles and torn aluminum siding the state national guard also dispatched water purification units and tanks with filled potable water 130 about guardsmen were deployed to southern louisiana 131 in early september officials announced that homes homes and apartments would become available to residents whose dwellings became uninhabitable 131 house resolution 5620 also included disaster aid to the state of louisiana 86 87 in early december the small business administration sba approved worth of low interest loans for repairs to homes and businesses by then fema had received about 43,600 applications for aid while approving in grants to over 18,000 households that were ineligible for loans from the sba or were uninsured in addition to the mobile homes already provided fema spent $22.6 million on disaster housing 132 see also edit tropical cyclones portal list of florida hurricanes 1926 miami
