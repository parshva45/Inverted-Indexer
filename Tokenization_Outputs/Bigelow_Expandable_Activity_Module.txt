4 diameter 4 living volume 3 4 the bigelow expandable activity module beam is an experimental expandable space station module developed by bigelow aerospace under contract to nasa for testing as a temporary module on the international space station iss from 2016 to at least 2020 it arrived at the iss on april 10 2016 5 was berthed to the station on april 16 and was expanded and pressurized on

shielding 5 bcss airlock 6 gallery 7 see also 8 references 9 external links history edit completed beam flight unit at the bigelow aerospace facility in north las vegas nasa originally considered the idea of inflatable habitats in the 1960s and developed the transhab inflatable module concept in the late 1990s the transhab project was cancelled by congress in 2000 6 7 8 and bigelow aerospace purchased the rights to the patents developed by nasa to pursue private space station designs 9 in 2006 and 2007 bigelow launched two demonstration modules to earth orbit genesis i and genesis ii 10 11 nasa re initiated analysis of expandable module technology for a variety of potential missions beginning in early 2010 12 13 various options were considered including procurement from commercial provider bigelow aerospace for providing what in 2010 was proposed to be a torus shaped storage module for the international space station one application of the toroidal beam design was as a centrifuge demo preceding further developments of the nasa nautilus x multi mission exploration concept vehicle 14 in january 2011 bigelow projected that the beam module could be built and made flight ready 24 months after a build contract was secured 15 on december 20 2012 nasa awarded bigelow aerospace a us 17.8 million contract to construct the bigelow expandable activity module under advanced exploration systems aes program 16 17 sierra nevada corporation built the $2 million common berthing mechanism under a 16 month firm fixed price contract awarded in may 2013 18 nasa plans made public in mid 2013 called for a 2015 delivery of the module to the iss 18 during a press event on march 12 2015 at the bigelow aerospace facility in north las vegas the completed iss flight unit compacted and with two canadarm2 grapple fixtures attached was displayed for the media 19 deployment and status edit progression of expansion of beam in early 2015 beam was scheduled for deployment on the next available iss transport vehicle spacex crs 8 which was scheduled for launch in september 2015 due to a rocket failure during the spacex crs 7 launch in june 2015 the delivery of beam was delayed 20 21 the successful launch of spacex crs 8 took place on april 8 2016 22 and the dragon cargo vehicle was berthed to the nadir port of harmony node on april 10 23 on april 16 british astronaut tim peake extracted beam from trunk using canadarm2 and installed it on the aft port of tranquility node 24 the first attempt at module inflation took place on may 26 2016 and was suspended after higher than expected air pressure inside beam was detected with minimal expansion of the module 25 the attempt was called off after two hours 26 the failure to expand and unfold is thought to have been the result of the unanticipated 10 month delay in module inflation which may have caused the fabric layers to stick together 25 the module was expanded on may 28 over the course of seven hours with air being injected 25 times for a total of 2 minutes 27 seconds 27 its length was extended from its stowed configuration less than expected 28 after expansion was complete air tanks aboard beam were opened to equalize air pressure in the module with that of the iss 29 the module will be monitored for two years 28 29 jeff williams inside beam on june 6 2016 astronaut jeff williams and cosmonaut oleg skripochka opened the hatch to beam and entered to collect an air sample download expansion data from sensors and install monitoring equipment the hatch to beam was re sealed on june 8 after three days of tests 30 31 a second round of tests took place on september 29 of that same year when astronaut kathleen rubins entered the module to install temporary monitoring equipment 32 nasa noted in may 2017 that after spending one year in space the beam instrumentation had recorded a few probable micrometeoroid debris impacts but that the protective layers had resisted any penetration early results from monitors inside the module have shown that galactic cosmic radiation levels are comparable to those in the rest of the space station further testing will try to characterize whether the inflatable structure is any more resilient to radiation than traditional metal modules 33 34 in october 2017 it was announced that the module would stay attached to the iss for another three years with options for two further one year extensions the module will be used to store up to 130 cargo transfer bags in an effort to free up additional space aboard the station 35 objectives edit the beam is an experimental program in an effort to test and validate expandable habitat technology 36 if beam performs favorably it could lead to development of expandable habitation structures for future crews traveling in deep space 37 the two year demonstration period will 36 38 demonstrate launch and deployment of a commercial inflatable module implement folding and packaging techniques for inflatable shell implement a venting system for inflatable shell during ascent to iss determine radiation protection capability of inflatable structures demonstrate design performance of commercial inflatable structure like thermal structural mechanical durability long term leak performance etc demonstrate safe deployment and operation of an inflatable structure in a flight mission at the end of mission the plan was to remove it from the iss and burn up during reentry 39 on january 18 2017 however bigelow and nasa announced they were discussing the possibility of extending the on orbit life of beam and using it for other purposes 40 characteristics edit beam in the process of being moved to the rear port of tranquility in april 2016 beam is composed of two metal bulkheads an aluminum structure and multiple layers of soft fabric with spacing between layers protecting an internal restraint and bladder system 41 it has neither windows nor internal power 42 the module was expanded about a month after being attached to the space station it was inflated from its packed dimensions of long and in diameter to its pressurized dimensions of long and in diameter 4 the module has a mass of 3 and its interior pressure is 101.4 kpa 14.7 psi 1.0 atm the same as inside of the iss 43 internal dimensions provide 3 of volume where a crew member will enter the module three to four times per year to collect sensor data perform microbial surface sampling conduct periodic change out of the radiation area monitors and inspect the general condition of the module 44 41 the hatch to the module will otherwise remain closed 45 its interior is described as being a large closet with padded white walls with various equipment and sensors attached to two central supports 46 radiation shielding edit the flexible kevlar like materials of construction are proprietary 47 48 the multiple layers of flexible fabric and closed cell vinyl polymer foam 49 in the beam structural shell are expected to provide impact protection see whipple shield as well as radiation protection but model calculations need to be validated by actual measurements 41 in a 2002 nasa study it was suggested that materials that have high hydrogen contents such as polyethylene can reduce primary and secondary radiation to a greater extent than metals such as aluminum 50 vinyl polymer may also be used in laboratories and other applications for radiation shield garments 51 bcss airlock edit as of 2013 update bigelow mentioned a concept to build a second beam module for use as an airlock on its planned bigelow commercial space station the inflatable nature would provide room for up to three crew or tourists to spacewalk simultaneously compared with a maximum of two that can operate outside the iss 52
