for different bands and modes computers are used for control datamodes sdr and logging the origins of amateur radio can be traced to the late 19th century but amateur radio as practiced today began in the early 20th century the first annual official wireless blue book of the wireless association of america produced in 1909 contains a list of amateur radio stations 3 this radio callbook lists wireless telegraph stations in canada and the united states including 89 amateur radio stations as with radio in general amateur radio was associated with various amateur experimenters and hobbyists amateur radio enthusiasts have significantly contributed to science engineering industry and social services research by amateur operators has founded new industries 4 built economies 5 empowered nations 6 and saved lives in times of emergency 7 8 ham radio can also be used in the classroom to teach english map skills geography math science and computer skills 9 ham radio edit main article etymology of ham radio the term ham was first a pejorative term used in professional wired telegraphy during the 19th century to mock operators with poor morse code sending skills ham fisted 10 11 12 13 this term continued to be used after the invention of radio and the proliferation of amateur experimentation with wireless telegraphy among land and sea based professional radio operators ham amateurs were considered a nuisance the use of ham meaning amateurish or unskilled survives today in other disciplines ham actor the amateur radio community subsequently began to reclaim the word as a label of pride 14 and by the mid 20th century it had lost its pejorative meaning although not an acronym it is often mistakenly written as ham in capital letters activities and practices edit the many facets of amateur radio attract practitioners with a wide range of interests many amateurs begin with a fascination of radio communication and then combine other personal interests to make pursuit of the hobby rewarding some of the focal areas amateurs pursue include radio contesting radio propagation study public service communication technical experimentation and computer networking amateur radio operators use various modes of transmission to communicate the two most common modes for voice transmissions are frequency modulation fm and single sideband ssb fm offers high quality audio signals while ssb is better at long distance communication when bandwidth is restricted 15 radiotelegraphy using morse code also known as cw from continuous wave is the wireless extension of landline wired telegraphy developed by samuel morse and dates to the earliest days of radio although computer based digital modes and methods have largely replaced cw for commercial and military applications many amateur radio operators still enjoy using the cw on the shortwave bands and for experimental work such as earth moon earth communication because of its inherent signal to noise ratio advantages morse using internationally agreed message encodings such as the q code enables communication between amateurs who speak different languages it is also popular with homebrewers and in particular with qrp or very low power enthusiasts as cw only transmitters are simpler to construct and the human ear brain signal processing system can pull weak cw signals out of the noise where voice signals would be totally inaudible a similar legacy mode popular with home constructors is amplitude modulation am pursued by many vintage amateur radio enthusiasts and aficionados of vacuum tube technology demonstrating a proficiency in morse code was for many years a requirement to obtain an amateur license to transmit on frequencies below following changes in international regulations in 2003 countries are no longer required to demand proficiency 16 the united states federal communications commission for example phased out this requirement for all license classes on 23 february 2007 17 18 modern personal computers have encouraged the use of digital modes such as radioteletype rtty which previously required cumbersome mechanical equipment 19 hams led the development of packet radio in the 1970s which has employed protocols such as ax 25 and tcp ip specialized digital modes such as psk31 allow real time low power communications on the shortwave bands echolink using voice over ip technology has enabled amateurs to communicate through local internet connected repeaters and radio nodes 20 while irlp has allowed the linking of repeaters to provide greater coverage area automatic link establishment ale has enabled continuous amateur radio networks to operate on the high frequency bands with global coverage other modes such as fsk441 using software such as wsjt are used for weak signal modes including meteor scatter and moonbounce communications fast scan amateur television has gained popularity as hobbyists adapt inexpensive consumer video electronics like camcorders and video cards in pcs because of the wide bandwidth and stable signals required amateur television is typically found in the frequency range though there is also limited use on and higher these requirements also effectively limit the signal range to between 20 and linked repeater systems however can allow transmissions of vhf and higher frequencies across hundreds of miles 21 repeaters are usually located on heights of land or tall structures and allow operators to communicate over hundreds of miles using hand held or mobile transceivers repeaters can also be linked together by using other amateur radio bands landline or the internet nasa astronaut col doug wheelock kf5boc expedition 24 flight engineer operates the na1ss ham radio station in the zvezda service module of the international space station equipment is a kenwood tm d700e transceiver amateur radio satellites can be accessed some using a hand held transceiver ht even at times using the factory rubber duck antenna 22 hams also use the moon the aurora borealis and the ionized trails of meteors as reflectors of radio waves 23 hams can also contact the international space station iss because many astronauts and cosmonauts are licensed as amateur radio operators 24 25 amateur radio operators use their amateur radio station to make contacts with individual hams as well as participating in round table discussion groups or rag chew sessions on the air some join in regularly scheduled on air meetings with other amateur radio operators called nets as in networks which are moderated by a station referred to as net control 26 nets can allow operators to learn procedures for emergencies be an informal round table or cover specific interests shared by a group amateur radio operators using battery or generator powered equipment often provide essential communications services when regular channels are unavailable due to natural disaster or other disruptive events many amateur radio operators participate in radio contests during which an individual or team of operators typically seek to contact and exchange information with as many other amateur radio stations as possible in a given period of time in addition to contests a number of amateur radio operating award schemes exist sometimes suffixed with on the air such as summits on the air islands on the air worked all states and jamboree on the air licensing edit the top of a tower supporting a yagi uda antenna and several wire antennas along with a canadian flag a handheld vhf uhf transceiver radio transmission permits are closely controlled by nations governments because radio waves propagate beyond national boundaries and therefore radio is of international concern also radio has possible clandestine uses both the requirements for and privileges granted to a licensee vary from country to country but generally follow the international regulations and standards established by the international telecommunication union 27 and world radio conferences all countries that license citizens to use amateur radio require operators to display knowledge and understanding of key concepts usually by passing an exam 28 the licenses grant hams the privilege to operate in larger segments of the radio frequency spectrum with a wider variety of communication techniques and with higher power levels relative to unlicensed personal radio services such as cb radio frs and pmr446 which require type approved equipment restricted in mode range and power amateur licensing is a routine civil administrative matter in many countries amateurs therein must pass an examination to demonstrate technical knowledge operating competence and awareness of legal and regulatory requirements in order to avoid interfering with other amateurs and other radio services a series of exams are often available each progressively more challenging and granting more privileges greater frequency availability higher power output permitted experimentation and in some countries distinctive call signs some countries such as the united kingdom and australia have begun requiring a practical assessment in addition to the written exams in order to obtain a license which they call a foundation license in most countries an operator will be assigned a call sign with their license in some countries a separate station license is required for any station used by an amateur radio operator amateur radio licenses may also be granted to organizations or clubs in some countries hams were allowed to operate only club stations 29 an amateur radio license is valid only in the country in which it is issued or in another country that has a reciprocal licensing agreement with the issuing country some countries such as syria and cuba restrict operation by foreigners to club stations only in some countries an amateur radio license is necessary in order to purchase or possess amateur radio equipment 30 amateur radio licensing in the united states exemplifies the way in which some countries award different levels of amateur radio licenses based on technical knowledge three sequential levels of licensing exams technician class general class and amateur extra class are currently offered which allow operators who pass them access to larger portions of the amateur radio spectrum and more desirable shorter call signs an exam authorized by the federal communications commission fcc is required for all levels of the amateur radio license these exams are administered by volunteer examiners accredited by the fcc recognized volunteer examiner coordinator vec system the technician class and general class exams consist of 35 multiple choice questions drawn randomly from a pool of at least 350 to pass 26 of the 35 questions must be answered correctly 31 the extra class exam has 50 multiple choice questions drawn randomly from a pool of at least 500 37 of which must be answered correctly 31 the tests cover regulations customs and technical knowledge such as fcc provisions operating practices advanced electronics theory radio equipment design and safety morse code is no longer tested in the u s once the exam is passed the fcc issues an amateur radio license which is valid for ten years studying for the exam is made easier because the entire question pools for all license classes are posted in advance the question pools are updated every four years by the national conference of vecs 31 licensing requirements edit prospective amateur radio operators are examined on understanding of the key concepts of electronics radio equipment antennas radio propagation rf safety and the radio regulations of the government granting the license these examinations are sets of questions typically posed in either a short answer or multiple choice format examinations can be administered by bureaucrats non paid certified examiners or previously licensed amateur radio operators the ease with which an individual can acquire an amateur radio license varies from country to country in some countries examinations may be offered only once or twice a year in the national capital and can be inordinately bureaucratic for example in india or challenging because some amateurs must undergo difficult security approval as in iran currently only yemen and north korea do not issue amateur radio licenses to their citizens although in both cases a limited number of foreign visitors have been permitted to obtain amateur licenses in the past decade some developing countries especially those in africa asia and latin america require the payment of annual license fees that can be prohibitively expensive for most of their citizens a few small countries may not have a national licensing process and may instead require prospective amateur radio operators to take the licensing examinations of a foreign country in countries with the largest numbers of amateur radio licensees such as japan the united states thailand canada and most of the countries in europe there are frequent license examinations opportunities in major cities granting a separate license to a club or organization generally requires that an individual with a current and valid amateur radio license who is in good standing with the telecommunications authority assumes responsibility for any operations conducted under the club license or club call sign a few countries may issue special licenses to novices or beginners that do not assign the individual a call sign but instead require the newly licensed individual to operate from stations licensed to a club or organization for a period of time before a higher class of license can be acquired reciprocal licensing edit further information amateur radio international operation reciprocal agreements by country cept member nations iarp member nations members of cept and iarp usa and canada treaty cept and iarp a reciprocal licensing agreement between two countries allows bearers of an amateur radio license in one country under certain conditions to legally operate an amateur radio station in the other country without having to obtain an amateur radio license from the country being visited or the bearer of a valid license in one country can receive a separate license and a call sign in another country both of which have a mutually agreed reciprocal licensing approvals reciprocal licensing requirements vary from country to country some countries have bilateral or multilateral reciprocal operating agreements allowing hams to operate within their borders with a single set of requirements some countries lack reciprocal licensing systems when traveling abroad visiting amateur operators must follow the rules of the country in which they wish to operate some countries have reciprocal international operating agreements allowing hams from other countries to operate within their borders with just their home country license other host countries require that the visiting ham apply for a formal permit or even a new host country issued license in advance the reciprocal recognition of licenses frequently not only depends on the involved licensing authorities but also on the nationality of the bearer as an example in the us foreign licenses are recognized only if the bearer does not have us citizenship and holds no us license which may differ in terms of operating privileges and restrictions conversely a us citizen may operate under reciprocal agreements in canada but not a non us citizen holding a us license newcomers edit many people start their involvement in amateur radio by finding a local club clubs often provide information about licensing local operating practices and technical advice newcomers also often study independently by purchasing books or other materials sometimes with the help of a mentor teacher or friend established amateurs who help newcomers are often referred to as elmers as coined by rodney newkirk w9brd 32 within the ham community 33 34 in addition many countries have national amateur radio societies which encourage newcomers and work with government communications regulation authorities for the benefit of all radio amateurs the oldest of these societies is the wireless institute of australia formed in 1910 other notable societies are the radio society of great britain the american radio relay league radio amateurs of canada bangladesh ngos network for radio and communication the new zealand association of radio transmitters and south african radio league see category amateur radio organizations call signs edit further information amateur radio call signs an amateur radio operator uses a call sign on the air to legally identify the operator and or station 35 in some countries the call sign assigned to the station must always be used whereas in other countries the call sign of either the operator or the station may be used 36 in certain jurisdictions an operator may also select a vanity call sign although these must also conform to the issuing allocation and structure used for amateur radio call signs 37 some jurisdictions require a fee to obtain such a vanity call sign in others such as the uk a fee is not required and the vanity call sign may be selected when the license is applied for the fcc in the u s discontinued its fee for vanity call sign applications in september 2015 38 call sign structure as prescribed by the itu consists of three parts which break down as follows using the call sign zs1nat as an example zs shows the country from which the call sign originates and may also indicate the license class this call sign is licensed in south africa 1 gives the subdivision of the country or territory indicated in the first part this one refers to the western cape nat the final part is unique to the holder of the license identifying that station specifically many countries do not follow the itu convention for the numeral in the united kingdom the original calls g0xxx g2xxx g3xxx g4xxx were full holders along with the last m0xxx full call signs issued by the city guilds examination authority in december 2003 additional full licenses were originally granted to with g1xxx g6xxx g7xxx g8xxx and 1991 onward with m1xxx callsigns the newer three level intermediate license holders are assigned 2e0xxx and 2e1xx and the basic foundation license holders are granted call signs m3xxx or m6xxx 39 instead of using numbers in the uk the second letter after the initial identifies the location for example a callsign g7ooe becomes gm7ooe when that license holder is operating a station in scotland prefix gm is scotland g or ge is england the may be omitted and gw is wales more information is available from the uk radio media licensing authority ofcom website in the united states for non vanity licenses the numeral indicates the geographical district the holder resided in when the license was first issued prior to 1978 us hams were required to obtain a new call sign if they moved out of their geographic district in canada call signs start with va ve vy vo and cy call signs starting with v end with a number after to indicate the political region prefix cy indicates geographic islands prefix va1 or ve1 is nova scotia va2 ve2 is quebec va3 ve3 is ontario va4 ve4 is manitoba va5 ve5 is saskatchewan va6 ve6 is alberta va7 ve7 is british columbia ve8 is the northwest territories ve9 is new brunswick vy0 is nunavut vy1 is the yukon territory vy2 is prince edward island vo1 is newfoundland and vo2 is labrador cy is for amateurs operating from sable and or st island both of which require coast guard permission to get to cy0 is sable island and cy9 is st island the last two or three letters of the callsigns are typically the choice upon completing the licensing test the ham writes three most preferred options two letter callsign suffixes require a ham to have already been licensed for callsigns in canada can be requested with a fee also for smaller geopolitical entities the numeral may be part of the country identification for example vp2xxx is in the british west indies which is subdivided into vp2exx anguilla vp2mxx montserrat and vp2vxx british virgin islands vp5xxx is in the turks and caicos islands vp6xxx is on pitcairn island vp8xxx is in the falklands and vp9xxx is in bermuda online callbooks or callsign databases can be browsed or searched to find out who holds a specific callsign 40 an example of an online callbook is qrz com non exhaustive lists of famous people who hold or have held amateur radio callsigns have also been compiled and published 41 many jurisdictions but not in the uk europe may issue specialty vehicle registration plates to licensed amateur radio operators often in order to facilitate their movement during an emergency 42 43 the fees for application and renewal are usually less than the standard rate for specialty plates 42 44 privileges edit in most administrations unlike other rf spectrum users radio amateurs may build or modify transmitting equipment for their own use within the amateur spectrum without the need to obtain government certification of the equipment 45 46 licensed amateurs can also use any frequency in their bands rather than being allocated fixed frequencies or channels and can operate medium to high powered equipment on a wide range of frequencies 47 so long as they meet certain technical parameters including occupied bandwidth power and prevention of spurious emission radio amateurs have access to frequency allocations throughout the rf spectrum usually allowing choice of an effective frequency for communications across a local regional or worldwide path the shortwave bands or hf are suitable for worldwide communication and the vhf and uhf bands normally provide local or regional communication while the microwave bands have enough space or bandwidth for amateur television transmissions and high speed computer networks the international symbol for amateur radio included in the logos of many iaru member societies the diamond holds a circuit diagram featuring components common to every radio an antenna inductor and ground in most countries an amateur radio license grants permission to the license holder to own modify and operate equipment that is not certified by a governmental regulatory agency this encourages amateur radio operators to experiment with home constructed or modified equipment the use of such equipment must still satisfy national and international standards on spurious emissions amateur radio operators are encouraged both by regulations and tradition of respectful use of the spectrum to use as little power as possible to accomplish the communication 48 this is to minimise interference or emc to any other device although allowable power levels are moderate by commercial standards they are sufficient to enable global communication lower license classes usually have lower power limits for example the lowest license class in the uk foundation licence has a limit of power limits vary from country to country and between license classes within a country for example the peak envelope power limits for the highest available license classes in a few selected countries are 2.25 kw in canada 49 in the united states in belgium luxembourg switzerland and new zealand in germany in italy in australia india and the united kingdom and in oman output power limits may also depend on the mode of transmission in australia for example may be used for ssb transmissions but fm and other modes are limited to the point at which power output is measured may also affect transmissions the united kingdom measures at the point the antenna is connected to the signal feed cable which means the radio system may transmit more than to overcome signal loss in the cable conversely germany measures power at the output of the final amplification stage which results in a loss in radiated power with longer cable feeds citation needed certain countries permit amateur radio licence holders to hold a notice of variation that allows higher power to be used than normally allowed for certain specific purposes e g in the uk some amateur radio licence holders are allowed to transmit using for experiments entailing using the moon as a passive radio reflector known as earth moon earth communication eme band plans and frequency allocations edit main article amateur radio frequency allocations the international telecommunication union itu governs the allocation of communications frequencies worldwide with participation by each communications regulation authority national communications regulators have some liberty to restrict access to these bandplan frequencies or to award additional allocations as long as radio services in other countries do not suffer interference in some countries specific emission types are restricted to certain parts of the radio spectrum and in most other countries international amateur radio union iaru member societies adopt voluntary plans to ensure the most effective use of spectrum in a few cases a national telecommunication agency may also allow hams to use frequencies outside of the internationally allocated amateur radio bands in trinidad and tobago hams are allowed to use a repeater which is located on this repeater is used and maintained by the national emergency management agency nema but may be used by radio amateurs in times of emergency or during normal times to test their capability and conduct emergency drills this repeater can also be used by non ham nema staff and react members in australia and new zealand ham operators are authorized to use one of the uhf tv channels in the u s amateur radio operators providing essential communication needs in connection with the immediate safety of human life and immediate protection of property when normal communication systems are not available may use any frequency including those of other radio services such as police and fire and in cases of disaster in alaska may use the statewide emergency frequency of with restrictions upon emissions 50 similarly amateurs in the united states may apply to be registered with the military auxiliary radio system mars once approved and trained these amateurs also operate on us government
