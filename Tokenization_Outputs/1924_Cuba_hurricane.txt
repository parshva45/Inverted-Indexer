fatalities around 90 total areas affected central america peninsula cuba florida the bahamas part of the 1924 atlantic hurricane season the 1924 cuba hurricane is the earliest officially classified category 5 atlantic hurricane on the scale and one of two hurricanes to make landfall on cuba at category 5 intensity the other being hurricane irma in 2017 it formed on in the western caribbean slowly organizing as it tracked northwestward by it attained hurricane status to the east of the peninsula and subsequently executed a small counterclockwise loop on the hurricane began undergoing rapid deepening and the next day it reached an estimated peak intensity of shortly thereafter it struck extreme western cuba at peak intensity becoming the strongest hurricane on record to hit the country later the hurricane weakened greatly striking southwestern florida with winds of in a sparsely populated region while crossing the state it weakened to tropical storm status and after accelerating east northeastward it was absorbed by a cold front on south of bermuda across the western caribbean sea the developing storm produced heavy rainfall and increased winds strong winds in western cuba caused severe damage with two small towns nearly destroyed about were killed in the country all in pinar del province later the hurricane brought heavy rainfall to southern florida which caused flooding and crop damage damage was light in the state and there were no casualties contents 1 meteorological history 2 impact and records 3 see also 4 references meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the scale on a tropical depression was first observed over the western caribbean sea just off the eastern honduras coast it was a large and weak tropical cyclone moving slowly northwestward and gradually intensifying on it is estimated the depression attained tropical storm status and its strengthening became more steady the next day the storm reached hurricane status about southeast of cozumel quintana roo around that time it began to execute a small counterclockwise loop off the east coast of the peninsula by the hurricane completed the loop during which its winds increased to this is the equivalence of a major hurricane or a on the hurricane scale the estimation of its strength at this point was based on subsequent analysis of peripheral recordings of atmospheric pressure and maximum sustained winds by ships and land stations 1 beginning late on as it tracked north northeastward toward cuba the hurricane underwent rapid deepening evidenced by a ship wind report of this wind report was initially thought to be the peak intensity of the cyclone however subsequent research confirmed further deepening based on very low pressures recorded across the region a ship in the radius of maximum winds reported a reading of 922 mbar the barometer on the ship was found to be too high resulting in a pressure of 1 additionally a station on land reported a pressure of 2 based on the readings the hurricane research division estimated the hurricane attained a minimum central pressure of very near the western coast of cuba this suggested peak winds of late on the hurricane made landfall in extreme western cuba in pinar del province 1 carlos director of the national observatory at havana believed that this hurricane was one of the most severe ever experienced in our latitudes 2 after exiting cuba into the gulf of mexico the hurricane weakened greatly on it passed a short distance west of key west florida and very early on the hurricane moved over marco island with winds of the cyclone weakened further as it turned eastward through the state deteriorating to tropical storm status as it passed near or over miami it accelerated east northeastward moving over the abaco islands in the bahamas gradually weakening the storm interacted with an approaching cold front late on it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and shortly thereafter it was absorbed by the front 1 impact and records edit as a developing tropical cyclone the storm produced increased winds and lower pressures in the swan islands off the coast of honduras 1 heavy rainfall occurred throughout jamaica causing street flooding and several mudslides but little damage no disruptions were reported to communications or railway travel 3 the storm brushed eastern belize while located off the coast producing of rainfall and light winds 4 in extreme western cuba damage was very severe from the strong winds likened to the impact of a tornado severe damage was reported in los arroyos and arroyos de mantua in the latter location around a dozen people were killed 50 were injured and nearly every building in the town was severely damaged heavy losses also occurred to the tobacco crop 2 across western pinar del province the hurricane destroyed all communication links 5 further from the center the capital city of havana recorded southerly winds of as well as a minimum pressure of about 2 around the country the hurricane capsized several ships primarily fishing vessels the death toll in the country was estimated at around 90 5 in the days after the storm cuban president zayas authorized about $30,000 in relief aid to send to hurricane victims in pinar del 6 several days prior to striking florida the outer circulation began producing rainfall across the state storm warnings were issued along the east and west coastlines northward to cedar key and titusville 7 later hurricane warnings were issued for much of the same area 8 and schools in the tampa area were closed as the storm was expected to move ashore 9 the hurricane first affected florida when it passed west of key west where sustained winds of along with gusts to were reported little damage occurred in the region limited to downed trees this was due to advance warning by the u s weather bureau which advised ships to remain at port and for residents to secure property 2 later the hurricane moved ashore in a sparsely populated region of southwestern florida 2 damage was reported in fort myers and punta gorda and communications were temporarily cut although no deaths were reported 10 heavy rainfall was reported along its path and one location accumulated in a period this established a new one day rainfall record in the state a station in miami recorded and wind gusts in the area approached hurricane force the combination of winds and rain damaged 5% of the local citrus and avocado crop 1 the rainfall flooded streets homes and commercial buildings in the miami area and hundreds of people were left without telephone access 11 no impact was reported in the bahamas 1 after a reanalysis of hurricanes between 1921 and 1925 the national hurricane centers atlantic reanalysis project determined this hurricane attained winds of making it a category 5 on the hurricane scale the hurricane is the earliest known to have attained the intensity besting the 1928 okeechobee hurricane which was previously thought to be the earliest storm of this intensity it is also one of only two on record to make landfall in cuba at status with the other being hurricane irma of 2017 which was slightly weaker at landfall having maximum sustained winds of 12 1 a hurricane in 1846 that hit the country was also thought to have struck at status although the storm existed prior to the start of the atlantic hurricane database 13 when the steamship toledo recorded an atmospheric pressure of in the storm it was the lowest pressure recorded in an atlantic hurricane breaking the previous record of 924 mbar 27.28 inhg in the atlantic hurricane of 1853 the record during this storm lasted until the 1932 cuba hurricane when a pressure of was reported 14 the reading of 932 mbar 27.52 inhg at los arroyos in mantua pinar del remains the lowest pressure recorded on land in cuba 15 see also edit tropical cyclones portal list of
