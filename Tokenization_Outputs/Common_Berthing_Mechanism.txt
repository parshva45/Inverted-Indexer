common berthing mechanism wikipedia common berthing mechanism from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search common berthing mechanism schematic diagram htv being deberthed from an active cbm the common berthing mechanism cbm is a berthing mechanism primarily used to connect pressurized elements within the us orbital segment of the international space station it roughly corresponds to the docking ports that are used to join such elements within the russian orbital segment it was developed by boeing at the marshall space flight center msfc in huntsville alabama under contract nas15 10000 from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa 1 the cbm system is a combination of structural mechanical and control components that perform the capture closure and passive structural connection between two pressurized modules the total cbm system is composed of two distinct sets of equipment the active and passive halves the active half acbm supports the mechanical and control elements which effect the actual capture and closure functions of the berthing operations the passive half pcbm contains the inert elements required to complete the berthing and closure action it also contains the seals effecting pressurized capability at the module module interface 2 the acbm was developed in response to specification s683 29902 cage 3a768 the pcbm was developed under specification s683 28943 cage 3a768 according to the specifications the cbm provides a module module clear passage diameter of 50 3 which is large enough to accommodate a standard hatch and allow international standard payload racks to be passed between modules using such racks payloads can be pre configured and transported to the station aboard a variety of logistics modules once the hatches have been opened and the module module vestibule configured electrical data and fluid lines can be manually connected by the crew in a shirt sleeve environment in addition to module module attachment locations the cbm is also used as a structural mechanical utility interface e g for the base of the z1 truss and for docking adapters at various locations the first modules in space using the cbm were unity and the pressurized mating adapters pma 1 and pma 2 with all three being launched attached together aboard endeavour the first berthing in space using the cbm was the connecting of the z1 truss to unity on the international space station 1 the cbm has been used as a berthing mechanism for the nsts transported multi purpose logistics modules and the unmanned japanese h ii transfer vehicle htv spacex dragon and orbital sciences cygnus spacecraft these spacecraft feature a pcbm and are berthed to one of the open acbms using the robot arm 4 each cbm compatible module that connects to previously launched modules requires a pcbm to connect to an acbm 1 the three iss connecting nodes feature four radial acbm ports unity features two acbm on the axial side while harmony and tranquility feature a pcbm on one axial side and an acbm on the other axial side 5 6 the destiny laboratory and the japanese pressurised module both feature one pcbm and one acbm 7 8 gallery edit a passive cbm an active cbm with covers closed play media closing of an active covers quadrant photograph of the active common berthing mechanism in the assembly level
