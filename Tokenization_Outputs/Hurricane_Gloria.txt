status until surpassed by hurricane opal in the 1995 atlantic hurricane season it was a powerful cape verde type hurricane that formed during the 1985 atlantic hurricane season originating from a tropical wave on in the eastern atlantic ocean after remaining a weak tropical cyclone for several days gloria intensified into a hurricane on north of the lesser antilles during that time the storm had moved generally westward although it turned to the northwest due to a weakening of the ridge gloria quickly intensified on and the next day reached peak winds of the hurricane weakened before striking the outer banks of north carolina on later that day gloria made two subsequent landfalls on long island and later western connecticut before becoming extratropical on over new england the remnants moved through atlantic canada eventually dissipating on before gloria made landfall the national hurricane center issued hurricane warnings at some point for the east coast of the united states from south carolina to maine hundreds of thousands of people evacuated and the hurricane was described as the storm of the century in general strongest winds remained east of the center which largely spared locations from north carolina to new jersey and the passage at low tide reduced storm surge hurricane force winds and gusts affected much of the path which knocked down trees and power lines this left over people without power including the worst power outage in connecticut history related to a natural disaster the extended power outage on long island affecting people at some point caused the long island lighting company to be shut down and be replaced with a public company fallen trees caused six of the fourteen deaths in north carolina high waves damaged many homes along the outer banks and caused heavy beach erosion high waves also damaged piers boats and docks throughout the mid atlantic states flooding forced several highways to close and in pennsylvania thousands were forced to evacuate their homes the storm surge destroyed on long island while the winds damaged the roofs of many more widespread crop damage occurred amounting to about 1985 usd nb 1 overall damage in the united states was estimated at which was less than expected in neighboring canada the remnants of gloria caused minor power outages in new brunswick although confusion related to the arrival

day the depression intensified into tropical storm gloria but there was no further intensification on gloria weakened back to tropical depression status but re intensified into a tropical storm on 4 during this time it moved generally westward due to a strong ridge to the north on the hurricane hunters began flying into gloria to measure the intensity and the next day a flight observed winds of at a height of as a result the national hurricane center nhc upgraded gloria to a hurricane about east northeast of the lesser antilles 2 after having moved generally to the west gloria turned more to the west northwest on this occurred after tropical storms fabian and henri weakened the ridge 2 on gloria passed about to the north of anegada the northernmost island in the lesser antilles it initially remained a minimal hurricane until when it began quickly intensifying that day it became a major hurricane nb 3 while passing northeast of the bahamas 4 gloria developed a wide eye 5 surrounded by an eyewall and was producing the stadium effect at 0120 utc on hurricane hunters extrapolated a barometric pressure of and reported flight level winds of 6 at the time this was the lowest pressure measured by reconnaissance aircraft over the northern atlantic ocean 2 because there was little difference in the flight level winds and the surface winds this was estimated to have been peak intensity making it a on the saffir simpson scale 6 however a preliminary reanalysis released in 2008 suggested peak winds of 5 at peak intensity the hurricane was located about southeast of cape hatteras in north carolina 2 and had an eye diameter of only 5 hurricane gloria to the east of florida after peak intensity gloria weakened while turning to the north moving around the western end of the ridge 2 toward a cold front 5 by the winds had decreased to just after its peak intensity 4 later that day a buoy about east of the center recorded a wave height of which at the time was the highest buoy wave recording in an atlantic hurricane 2 while accelerating toward north carolina gloria re intensified slightly to winds of making it a hurricane at on the hurricane struck southern hatteras island in the outer banks 7 after weakening further gloria passed just east of the delmarva peninsula and new jersey and interacted with a cold front its strongest winds remained on the eastern edge of the circulation and the storm was gradually losing tropical characteristics 2 5 at on the hurricane made landfall with a broad and poorly defined center between john f kennedy international airport and islip new york with winds of on western long island 7 8 this was only about three days after henri struck the same general area as a much weaker tropical storm 9 about an hour after striking long island gloria made its final landfall in western connecticut near westport and proceeded to move through new england while weakening 5 9 the nhc estimated that gloria became extratropical over maine early by on 6 the storm continued to the northeast through atlantic canada passing south of greenland on the extratropical circulation of gloria was last noted on 4 although the remnants later affected europe 6 preparations edit flooding from hurricane gloria in cape may point new jersey early in duration it threatened the northern lesser antilles prompting a hurricane

residents also evacuated portions of cape cod 9 as gloria approached the east coast of the united states national hurricane center director neil frank called it the storm of the century due to its intensity and potential track over the densely populated region of new england 11 such a track gathered the attention of many people and led to the evacuation of along the coast from north carolina to connecticut 12 in maryland officials implemented lane reversing to expedite the evacuation process a policy many other coastal states use 13 officials advised 95,000 citizens along the new jersey

light located offshore sustained winds reached with gusts to a peak storm surge of was estimated at the neuse river a minimal surge of around occurred in neighboring south carolina where winds were below tropical storm force 2 the highest rainfall related to gloria was recorded in edenton north carolina 18 high waves and storm surge resulted in heavy coastal flooding and beach erosion along the outer banks 2 and several new inlets were created coastal flooding damaged several homes in the outer banks damage in the state was estimated at including in crop damage there was one death in north carolina when a man was struck by a fallen tree 9 throughout much of the mid atlantic the winds remained generally below hurricane force however winds reached along the chesapeake bay bridge tunnel in virginia and gusts to in ocean city maryland the strongest winds in the region occurred after the center passed the area due to fast motion there was minimal coastal flooding because the highest storm surge occurred during low tide generally less than beach erosion was reported in both maryland and delaware 2 the heaviest rainfall was west of the center statewide peaks included at valley forge national historical park in pennsylvania in holland virginia and in annapolis maryland rainfall spread as far inland as west virginia 19 high waves washed away of a fishing pier in virginia beach virginia the rainfall caused minor flooding and high tides flooded coastal portions of the hampton roads region there was minor damage to trees roofs and signs in southeastern virginia the center of gloria passed about offshore eastern maryland in ocean city waves of severely damaged the boardwalk washing sand and debris a block inland downed trees left about in maryland high winds forced the chesapeake bay bridge to close and there was little damage outside of eastern maryland high waves in delaware eroded beaches wrecked dunes and damaged oceanfront buildings and boardwalks storm flooding closed several highways including delaware route 1 damage was heaviest in sussex county although the storm damaged corn and soybean crops in northern delaware monetary damage totaled over $500,000 in the state in neighboring pennsylvania wind gusts reached in allentown which knocked down many trees and left thousands without power heavy rainfall flooded many streams which closed or

along the coast and several coastal towns sustained damage to boardwalks strong winds downed trees and power lines which damaged homes and cars one person was killed in long branch after touching a downed power line 9 though gloria moved quickly through the region it dropped moderate rainfall in locations including at international airport 20 in addition some unofficial reports in southeastern virginia indicated amounts of up to of rain 21 because much of the mid atlantic experienced the western weaker side of this hurricane damage was relatively light high winds downed numerous trees throughout the area leaving hundreds of thousands without power including 237,000 in new jersey 124,000 in maryland and 56,000 in virginia 22 extreme rainfall in virginia resulted in in damage 21 intense flood waters split long beach island in half for a period of time 23 long island and new york edit rainfall totals related to hurricane gloria while making its second landfall gloria was accompanied by a storm surge of at battery park the highest along its path the highest wind report was a gust of at islip airport central park reported a gust of 2 rainfall in the state reached at unadilla 19 although was much less near the coast reaching in central park 2 along long island the high storm surge flooded hundreds of streets and caused heavy beach erosion high winds downed thousands of trees and damaged hundreds of homes causing widespread power outages about people in the state lost power including two thirds of the long island lighting company customers making it one of the worst power outages in the state there were four deaths on long island two of whom related to heart attacks and the other two related to fallen trees there were also in the region many of them due to downed tree branches in the new york mainland heavy rainfall flooded rivers and alleviated drought conditions rough waves damaged boats and docks along the hudson river unsettled weather contributed to a traffic fatality and an airplane crash that killed one in the new york mainland 9 it is believed peak gusts reached in eastern long island 22 weather forecasters believe that damage across parts of long island indicated winds in the category three range as evidence of the damage received at macarthur airport 2 high winds caused significant damage across long island and southeastern new york the area hit the worst was eastern long island where high wind gusts blew thousands of trees into buildings and across roads the broadcast tower of wbli fm toppled on bald hill in farmingville in addition the winds ripped roofs off of many buildings including hangars at the macarthur airport a hangar at the bayport aerodrome and the roof of the islip police station 22 prolonged exposure to high winds and waves led to moderate beach erosion washing away several piers and docks 22 the storm surge though relatively weak destroyed on the ocean side of the island high winds left in new york without power with some lacking electricity for over eleven days 24 new england and canada edit satellite image of gloria nearing new england while moving across new england gloria was a weakened hurricane that passed quickly through the area though still a large hurricane gloria hit at low tide resulting in low to moderate storm surges of in groton connecticut in new bedford massachusetts and in portland maine the high waves caused heavy beach erosion in connecticut and rhode island the highest sustained winds were reports of in waterbury connecticut and blue hill meteorological observatory in massachusetts although neither location is at sea level gusts peaked at in chatham massachusetts and widespread areas across new england reported hurricane force gusts 2 it is estimated that hurricane force winds occurred in connecticut massachusetts and new hampshire 5 rainfall in the region peaked at at borden brook reservoir in springfield massachusetts 25 in connecticut gloria crossed from westport along the long island sound passed near hartford and exited into massachusetts wind gusts peaked at in bridgeport and also reached in hartford the winds downed thousands of trees many of which knocked down power lines this left about without power setting a record for the state related to a weather event high waves damaged or sunk hundreds of boats along the coast and several beachfront homes and docks were damaged light rainfall caused some minor flooding mostly in northwestern connecticut statewide there was about in crop damage damage was heaviest near

peaking at in westerly the winds uprooted thousands of trees and caused widespread roof damage about statewide lost power the greatest since the northeast blackout of 1965 coastal flooding was minimized due to the storm striking at low tide although were high enough in narragansett bay to damage docks and hundreds of boats damage in the state was estimated at including the cost for restoring the power outages there were two deaths in rhode island one was related to a fallen tree and one occurred when a man was trying to secure his boat 9 in massachusetts the hurricane moved from connecticut through the springfield area 9 there was a small f1 tornado in middlesex county that damaged trees 26 high winds knocked over thousands of trees and about statewide lost power heavy

several fishing piers and some roadways were underwater during the passage 22 new hampshire was affected only slightly from the hurricane and was limited to minor wind damage and localized flooding 27 in maine damage was more severe where strong wind gusts ripped off roofs and uprooted hundreds of trees high winds across new england resulted in significant power outages leaving 250,000 in maine 28 in all seven deaths occurred in new england many of which occurred from falling tree limbs 22 while the remnants of gloria were moving through atlantic canada they produced rainfall to the north of the track reaching as high as in quebec the highest winds in the country were peaking in the bay of fundy and to the northeast of newfoundland the remnants of gloria caused wind and wave damage in nova scotia wind gusts of in fredericton new brunswick knocked down power lines affecting more than 29 aftermath edit see also list of retired atlantic hurricane names on long island thousands were left without power for over a week 9 until the last outages were restored two weeks after the storm on the long duration without electricity forced hundreds of schools to close extended train times by six hours due to lack of powered crossings and price gouging on food ice and generators the lack of power led to a general disdain for the long island lighting company lilco which increased further when the company left the repair bill to the ratepayers citing the lack of hurricane insurance citizens quickly protested decision and within years the publicly owned long island power authority was formed 24 residents in both massachusetts and connecticut were also without power for up to one week which caused many food products to spoil due to lack of refrigeration the states brought in workers from other states although the delay in restoring the widespread outages caused many schools to remain closed in connecticut one man was electrocuted while repairing downed power lines 9 about 477,000 connecticut light power customers in the state lost power a record that was surpassed by the 754,000 who lost power during hurricane irene in 2011 30 later in 2011 a in october left over statewide without power also breaking the record set by gloria 31 in new hampshire most power outages were quickly restored and all were restored within six days in maine all power outages were restored in 26

business during the power outage after the storm several businesses stored frozen goods for houses without a generator 28 after the storm president ronald reagan declared several counties in new jersey pennsylvania new york rhode island connecticut and massachusetts as federal disaster areas this declaration allowed those counties to apply for disaster assistance 32 in canada the damage was less than expected but confusion related to the storm threat prompted environment canada to research the need for a dedicated hurricane centre in 1986 the following year the canadian hurricane centre was established with offices on both the atlantic and pacific coasts 16 due to its impact the name gloria was retired from the atlantic tropical storm naming list it will never again be used for an
