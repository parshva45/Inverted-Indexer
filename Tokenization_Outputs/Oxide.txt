oxide wikipedia oxide from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the unit cell of rutile ti iv centers are grey oxide centers are red notice that oxide forms three bonds to titanium and titanium forms six bonds to oxide an oxide k s d is a chemical compound that contains at least one oxygen atom and one other element 1 in its chemical formula oxide itself is the dianion of oxygen an o atom metal oxides thus typically contain an anion of oxygen in the oxidation state of most of the crust consists of solid oxides the result of elements being oxidized by the oxygen in air or in water hydrocarbon combustion affords the two principal carbon oxides carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide even materials considered pure elements often develop an oxide coating for example aluminium foil develops a thin skin of al 2 o 3 called a passivation layer that protects the foil from further corrosion 2 individual elements can often form multiple oxides each containing different amounts of the element and oxygen in some cases these are distinguished by specifying the number of atoms as in carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide and in other cases by specifying the oxidation number as in iron ii oxide and iron iii oxide certain elements can form many different oxides such those of nitrogen contents 1 formation 2 structure 2.1 oxides of metals 2.2 molecular oxides 3 reactivity

corresponding oxides noble metals such as gold or platinum are prized because they resist direct chemical combination with oxygen and substances like gold iii oxide must be generated by indirect routes two independent pathways for corrosion of elements are hydrolysis and oxidation by oxygen the combination of water and oxygen is even more corrosive virtually all elements burn in an atmosphere of oxygen or an oxygen rich environment in the presence of water and oxygen or simply air some sodium rapidly even dangerously to give the hydroxides in part for this reason alkali and alkaline earth metals are not found in nature in their metallic i e native form caesium is so reactive with oxygen that it is used as a getter in vacuum tubes and solutions of potassium and sodium so called nak are used to deoxygenate and dehydrate some organic solvents the surface of most metals consists of oxides and hydroxides in the presence of air a well known example is aluminium foil which is coated with a thin film of aluminium oxide that passivates the metal slowing further corrosion the aluminium oxide layer can be built to greater thickness by the process of electrolytic anodising though solid magnesium and aluminium react slowly with oxygen at stp like most metals burn in air generating very high temperatures finely grained powders of most metals can be dangerously explosive in air consequently they are often used in solid fuel rockets oxides such as iron iii oxide or rust which consists of hydrated iron iii oxides fe 2 o 3 n h 2 o and iron iii oxide hydroxide feo oh fe oh 3 form when oxygen combines with other elements in dry oxygen iron readily forms iron ii oxide but the formation of the hydrated ferric oxides fe 2 o x oh 2 x that mainly comprise rust typically requires oxygen and water free oxygen production by photosynthetic bacteria some 3.5 billion years ago precipitated iron out of solution in the oceans as fe 2 o 3 in the economically important iron ore hematite structure edit oxides have a range of different structures from individual molecules to polymeric and crystalline structures at standard conditions oxides may range from solids to gases oxides of metals edit oxides of most metals adopt polymeric structures 3 the oxide typically links three metals e g rutile structure or six metals carborundum or rock salt structures because the m o bonds are typically strong and these compounds are crosslinked polymers the solids tend to be insoluble in solvents though they are attacked by acids and bases the formulas are often deceptively simple many are nonstoichiometric compounds 2 molecular oxides edit some important gaseous oxides carbon dioxide is the main product of fossil fuel combustion carbon monoxide is the product of the incomplete combustion of carbon based fuels and precursor to many useful chemicals nitrogen dioxide is a problematic pollutant from internal combustion engines sulfur dioxide the principal oxide of sulfur is emitted from volcanoes nitrous oxide laughing gas is a potent greenhouse gas produced by soil bacteria although most metal oxides are polymeric some oxides are molecules examples of molecular oxides are carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide all simple oxides of nitrogen are molecular e g no n 2 o no 2 and n 2 o 4 phosphorus pentoxide is a more complex molecular oxide with a deceptive name the real formula being p 4 o 10 some polymeric oxides depolymerize when heated to give molecules examples being selenium dioxide and sulfur trioxide tetroxides are rare the more common examples ruthenium tetroxide osmium tetroxide and xenon tetroxide many oxyanions are known such as polyphosphates and polyoxometalates oxycations are rarer some examples being nitrosonium no vanadyl vo 2+ and uranyl uo 2+ 2 of course many compounds are known with both oxides and other groups in organic chemistry these include ketones and many related carbonyl compounds for the transition metals many oxo complexes are known as well as oxyhalides reactivity edit oxides can be reacted by acids or bases those reacted only by acids are basic oxides those reacted only by bases are acidic oxides oxides that react with both acids and bases are amphoteric metals tend to form basic oxides non metals tend to form acidic oxides and amphoteric oxides are formed by elements near the boundary between metals and non metals metalloids this reactivity is the basis of many practical processes such as the extraction of some metals from their ores in the process called hydrometallurgy reduction edit converting the metal oxide back to the pure metal is called reduction there are many ways of reduction reduction by carbon edit see also carbothermic reduction metals are won from their oxides by chemical reduction a common and cheap reducing agent is carbon in the form of coke the most prominent example is that of iron ore smelting many reactions are involved but the simplified equation is usually shown as 2 2 fe 2 o 3 3 c 4 fe 3 co 2 metal oxides can be reduced by organic compounds this redox process is the basis for many important transformations in chemistry such as the detoxification of drugs by the p450 enzymes and the production of ethylene oxide which is converted to antifreeze in such systems the metal centre transfers an oxide ligand to the organic compound followed by regeneration of the metal oxide often by oxygen in air reduction by heating edit see also thermal decomposition metals that are lower in the reactivity series can be reduced by heating alone for example silver oxide decomposes at 4 2 ag 2 o 4 ag o 2 reduction by displacement edit see also single displacement reaction metals that are more reactive displace the oxide of the metals that are less reactive for example zinc is more reactive than copper so it displaces copper ii oxide to form zinc oxide zn cuo zno cu reduction by hydrogen edit see also single displacement reaction apart from metals hydrogen can also displace metal oxides to form hydrogen oxide also known as water h 2 cuo cu h 2 o reduction by electrolysis edit see also electrolysis since metals that are reactive form oxides that are stable some metal oxides must be electrolyzed to be reduced this includes sodium oxide potassium oxide calcium oxide magnesium oxide and aluminium oxide the oxides must be molten before immersing graphite electrodes in it 2al 2 o 3 4al 3o 2 hydrolysis edit oxides of more electropositive elements tend to be basic they are called basic anhydrides exposed to water they may form basic hydroxides for example sodium oxide is hydrated it forms sodium hydroxide oxides of more electronegative elements tend to be acidic they are called acid anhydrides adding water they form oxoacids for example dichlorine heptoxide is an acid anhydride perchloric acid is its fully hydrated form some oxides can act as both acid and base they are amphoteric an example is aluminium oxide some oxides do not show behavior as either acid or base the oxide ion has the formula o it is the conjugate base of the hydroxide ion oh and is encountered in ionic solid such as calcium oxide o is unstable in aqueous solution its affinity for h is so great p k b that it abstracts a proton from a solvent h 2 o molecule o h 2 o 2 oh the equilibrium constant of aforesaid reactions is pk eq in the 18th century oxides were named calxes or calces after the calcination process used to produce oxides calx was later replaced by oxyd nomenclature and formulas edit sometimes metal oxygen ratios are used to name oxides thus nbo would be called niobium monoxide and tio 2 is titanium dioxide this naming follows the greek numerical prefixes in the older literature and continuing in industry oxides are named by adding the suffix a to the name hence alumina magnesia and chromia are respectively al 2 o 3 mgo and cr 2 o 3 special types of oxides are peroxide o 2 and superoxide o 2 in such species oxygen is assigned higher oxidation states than oxide the chemical formulas of the oxides of the chemical elements in their highest oxidation state are predictable and are derived from the number of valence electrons for that element even the chemical formula of o 4 tetraoxygen is predictable as a group 16 element one exception is copper for which the highest oxidation state oxide is copper ii oxide and not copper i oxide another exception is fluoride which does not exist as one might f 2 o 7 as of 2 5 since fluorine is more electronegative than oxygen oxygen difluoride of 2 does not represent an oxide of fluorine but instead represents a fluoride of oxygen examples of oxides edit the following table gives examples of commonly encountered oxides only a few representatives are
