the central america volcanic arc there is a great deal of seismic activity in the region volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur frequently these natural disasters have resulted in the loss of many lives and much property in the pre columbian era central america was inhabited by the indigenous peoples of mesoamerica to the north and west and the isthmo colombian peoples to the south and east

most of costa rica and panama were predominantly speakers of the chibchan languages at the time of european contact and are considered by some 11 culturally different and grouped in the isthmo colombian area following christopher columbus s voyages to the americas the spanish sent many expeditions to the region and they began their conquest of maya territory in 1523 soon after the conquest of the aztec empire spanish conquistador pedro de alvarado commenced the conquest of northern central america for the spanish empire beginning with his arrival in soconusco in 1523 forces systematically conquered and subjugated most of the major maya kingdoms including the pipil and the kaqchikel by 1528 the conquest of guatemala was nearly complete with only the basin remaining

state of chiapas but excluded the lands that would become belize and panama the president of the audiencia which had its seat in antigua guatemala was the governor of the entire area in 1609 the area became a captaincy general and the governor was also granted the title of captain general the captaincy general of guatemala encompassed most of central america with the exception of present day belize and panama the captaincy general of guatemala lasted for more than two centuries but began to fray after a rebellion in 1811 which began in the intendancy of san salvador the captaincy general

threatened 107 of which are classified as critically endangered the underlying problems are deforestation which is estimated by fao at 1.2% per year in central america and mexico combined fragmentation of rainforests and the fact that 80% of the vegetation in central america has already been converted to agriculture 25 efforts to protect fauna and flora in the region are made by creating ecoregions and nature reserves 36% of land territory falls under some form of official protected status giving belize one of the most extensive systems of terrestrial protected areas in the

set off by a gain in the coniferous forest biome with 4,730 square kilometers and a gain in the dry forest biome at 2,054 square kilometers mangroves and deserts contributed only 1% to the loss in forest vegetation the bulk of the deforestation was located at the caribbean slopes of nicaragua with a loss of 8,574 square kilometers of forest in the period from 2001 to 2010 the most significant regrowth of 3,050 square kilometers of forest was seen in the coniferous woody vegetation of honduras 28 the central american pine oak forests ecoregion in the tropical and subtropical coniferous

american pine oak forests are composed of many species characteristic of temperate north america including oak pine fir and cypress laurel forest is the most common type of central american temperate evergreen cloud forest found in almost all central american countries normally more than 1,000 meters above sea level tree species include evergreen oaks members of the laurel family and species of

the only cloud forest in the pacific coastal zone of central america is on the mombacho volcano in nicaragua in costa rica there are laurel forests in the cordillera de and arenal called monteverde also in the cordillera de talamanca the central american montane forests are an ecoregion of the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome as defined by the world wildlife fund 31 these forests are of the moist deciduous and the semi evergreen seasonal subtype of tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests and receive high overall rainfall with a warm summer wet season and a cooler winter dry season central american montane forests consist of forest patches located at altitudes ranging from metres on the summits and slopes of the highest mountains in central america ranging from southern mexico through guatemala el salvador and honduras to northern nicaragua the entire ecoregion covers an area of 13,200 square kilometers and has a temperate climate with relatively high precipitation levels 31 fauna edit see also list of central american mammals and list of central american monkey species ecoregions are not only established to protect the forests themselves but also because they are habitats for an incomparably rich and often endemic fauna almost half of the bird population of the talamancan montane forests in costa rica and panama are endemic to this region several birds are listed as threatened most notably the resplendent quetzal pharomacrus mocinno three wattled bellbird procnias tricarunculata bare necked umbrellabird cephalopterus glabricollis and black guan chamaepetes unicolor many of the amphibians are endemic and depend on the existence of forest the golden toad that once inhabited a small region in the monteverde reserve which is part of the talamancan montane forests has not been seen alive since 1989 and is listed as extinct by iucn the exact causes for its extincition are unknown global warming may have played a role because the development of fog that is typical for this area may have been compromised seven small mammals are endemic to the costa rica chiriqui highlands within the talamancan montane forest

geology edit central america and the caribbean plate see also central america volcanic arc list of earthquakes in costa rica list of earthquakes in el salvador list of earthquakes in guatemala and list of earthquakes in nicaragua central america is geologically very active with volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occurring frequently and tsunamis occurring occasionally many thousands of people have died as a result of these natural disasters most of central america rests atop the caribbean plate this tectonic plate converges with the cocos nazca and north american plates to form the middle america trench a major subduction zone the middle america trench is situated some kilometers off the pacific coast of central america and runs roughly parallel to it many large earthquakes have occurred as a result of seismic activity at the middle america trench 32 for example subduction of the cocos plate beneath the north american plate at the middle america trench is believed to have caused the 1985 mexico city earthquake that killed as many as 40,000 people seismic activity at the middle america trench is also responsible for earthquakes in 1902 1942 1956 1982 1992 2001 2007 2012 2014 and many other earthquakes throughout central america the middle america trench is not the only source of seismic activity in central america the motagua fault is an onshore continuation of the cayman trough which forms part of the tectonic boundary between the north american plate and the caribbean plate this transform fault cuts right across guatemala and then continues offshore until it merges with the middle america trench along the pacific coast of mexico near acapulco seismic activity at the motagua fault has been responsible for earthquakes in 1717 1773 1902 1976 1980 and 2009 another onshore continuation of the cayman trough is the chixoy polochic fault which runs parallel to and roughly 80 kilometers to the north of the motagua fault though less active than the motagua fault seismic activity at the chixoy polochic fault is still thought to be capable of producing very large earthquakes such as the 1816 earthquake of guatemala 33 managua the capital of nicaragua was devastated by earthquakes in 1931 and 1972 volcanic eruptions are also common in central america in 1968 the arenal volcano in costa rica erupted killing 87 people as the 3 villages of tabacon pueblo
