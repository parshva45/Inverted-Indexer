importance of the school two universities were initially chartered but later the decision was repealed in favor of a single university in lewis county provided that locally donated land was available when no site emerged denny successfully petitioned the legislature to reconsider seattle as a location in 1858 in 1861 scouting began for an appropriate 10 acres site in seattle to serve as a new university campus arthur and mary denny donated eight acres while fellow pioneers edward lander and charlie and mary terry donated two acres on knoll in downtown seattle 7 more specifically this tract
