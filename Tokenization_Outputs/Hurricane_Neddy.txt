referencing one of the series writers steve young a writer for the late show with david letterman was brought in as a freelance writer to write the episode 4 the writers wanted to explore what made flanders tick and examine what made him act the way he does 4 the original idea came from george meyer who had also wanted an episode about flanders faith being tested 5 one of the key story points came from his friend jack handey a writer for saturday night live who wanted to do a sketch about a down on his luck shoemaker who is visited by elves who help him but make very bad shoes likewise it inspired the idea that the neighbors would rebuild flanders house but do a bad job and provoke an outburst 5 writer john animated likeness can be seen in a padded cell in reference to his reclusiveness a caricature of john swartzwelder can be seen shutting the door of a room in calmwood mental hospital 4 later in the episode during the scene where the townsfolk are welcoming ned back
