hurricane michelle was the fifth costliest tropical cyclone in cuban history and strongest of the 2001 atlantic hurricane season the thirteenth named storm and seventh hurricane that year michelle developed from a tropical wave that had traversed into the western caribbean sea on the wave had initially moved off the coast of africa prior in its early developmental stages the depression meandered over nicaragua later paralleling the mosquito coast before intensifying into tropical storm intensity on michelle was upgraded to hurricane strength the following day shortly after rapid intensification ensued within favorable conditions with the central barometric pressure dropping hpa in after a slight fluctuation in strength michelle reached its peak intensity as a hurricane with winds of and a minimum pressure of hpa nb 1 at roughly the same time the hurricane began to accelerate northeastward this brought the intense hurricane to a cuban landfall within the bay of pigs later that day crossing over the island michelle was weakened significantly and was only a hurricane upon reentry into the atlantic ocean the hurricane later transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over the bahamas on before being absorbed by a cold front the following day hurricane michelle caused widespread devastation across the western caribbean during its eight day trek as a tropical wave torrential rainfall occurred across jamaica causing mudslides and killing two people damage in the island country was estimated at nb 2 when the storm drifted over areas of central america early in its existence heavy rains isolated numerous villages and damaged infrastructure affecting areas affected by hurricane mitch roughly three years prior in honduras and nicaragua were killed with an additional unaccounted for in the cayman islands areas were affected by strong storm surge and flooding particularly in grand cayman where damage was totaled the majority of damage caused by michelle occurred in cuba where the storm was the strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall on the island in over strong storm surge and heavy rainfall disrupted communication networks across the country high winds and rain also destroyed buildings and damaged the sugar cane crop at the time michelle was the costliest hurricane in cuban history with an estimated in damage this figure was greatly surpassed by hurricane ike nearly seven years later as a weakening system michelle moved past florida and the bahamas strong waves caused severe beach erosion and winds damaged property throughout the

and moved into the atlantic ocean at the time the wave produced minimal convective and thunderstorm activity on the disturbance crossed the lesser antilles before moving into the caribbean sea while showing minimal signs of tropical development three days later the wave moved into the western caribbean spawning a broad low pressure area off the coast of nicaragua at 1800 utc on 1 a reconnaissance flight confirmed the development of a tropical depression south southwest of puerto cabezas nicaragua 2 at the time convection was displaced primarily to the north of the center of circulation and the storm was situated in a weak steering pattern as such initial forecasts predicted for the depression designated as tropical depression fifteen to slowly move generally northward 3 later that day a burst of convection occurred over the circulation center of the depression indicating an increase in organization 4 the disturbance meandered over eastern nicaragua for before emerging into the caribbean sea near cabo gracias a dios by on 1 5 upon emerging into the caribbean sea the depression quickly organized and the national hurricane center nhc upgraded the depression to tropical storm strength at the following day based on information from a reconnaissance flight prior as such the tropical storm was designated with the name michelle 6 7 gradual strengthening occurred throughout as cloud tops began to cool as it drifted northward signifying strengthening at the time the nhc predicted that there was a roughly chance for the tropical storm to rapidly intensify by that time the storm had met three of the five criterion for rapid intensification 8 during the day fluctuations in convective activity occurred and there were some signs of wind shear affecting the cyclone but there was a general strengthening trend 9 two dropsondes deployed within the system early on observed hurricane force winds within michelle based on this data the nhc upgraded michelle to hurricane intensity at that day 7 while the storm was situated south southeast of the guanahacabibes peninsula 10 hurricane michelle undergoing extratropical transition over the bahamas on a period of rapid intensification began shortly after as satellite presentation improved with the minimum barometric pressure falling hpa in 1 at on the hurricane attained hurricane intensity at roughly the same time the eye became more apparent on satellite imagery 11 by later that day michelle had intensified to a hurricane 7 six hours later the hurricane weakened to intensity but reached its minimum barometric pressure of hpa afterwards central pressure began to rise despite the trend its maximum sustained winds also strengthened as it curved northeastward 7 despite having its convective organization disrupted and its eye no longer as apparent on 12 michelle attained winds of by that day these would be the highest sustained winds estimated for the system throughout its existence 7 at on michelle made landfall on cayo largo del sur as a hurricane with winds of this was followed shortly after with a landfall on the bay of pigs five hours later as a slightly weaker storm when michelle made landfall on the cuban mainland it was the strongest landfalling hurricane in cuban history since the landfall of hurricane fox in 1952 at the time the minimum barometric pressure was hpa over cuba center of circulation was significantly disrupted and as a result the hurricane decreased in intensity 1 by the time it had emerged into the atlantic ocean on winds were only estimated at 7 southwesterly wind shear further inhibited any additional tropical development and as such michelle began to transition into an extratropical cyclone 13 that day the weakening hurricane made landfalls over andros island and eleuthera island before becoming fully extratropical by on while still maintaining hurricane force winds the extratropical system persisted for roughly hours before it was absorbed by an approaching cold front 1 preparations edit cuba edit warnings and watches associated with hurricane michelle as it made landfall on cuba on as hurricane michelle approached the cuban coast the government of cuba issued a hurricane watch for the western cuban provinces of pinar del la habana matanzas and isla de la juventud at on 14 the following day the same hurricane watch was
