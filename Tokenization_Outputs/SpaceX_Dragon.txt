space by the spacex falcon 9 two stage to orbit launch vehicle and spacex is developing a crewed version called the dragon v2 formerly dragonrider the dragon spacecraft was originally designed for human travel but so far has only been used to deliver cargo to the international space station iss while carrying out resupply missions to the iss space x has continued to work on the production of a human rated model this model will be able to be controlled by the command center in hawthorne ca as well as by the crew of the spacecraft during its maiden flight in december 2010 dragon became the first commercially built and operated spacecraft to be recovered successfully from orbit 2 on 25 may 2012 a cargo variant of dragon became the first commercial spacecraft to successfully rendezvous with and attach to the international space station iss 10 11 12 spacex is contracted to deliver cargo to the iss under nasa s commercial resupply services program and dragon began regular cargo

developing the dragon spacecraft in late 2004 making a public announcement in 2006 with a plan of entering service in 2009 20 also in 2006 spacex won a contract to use the dragon spacecraft for commercially supplied resupply services to the international space station for the american federal space agency nasa 21 nasa iss resupply contract edit commercial orbital transportation services edit in 2005 nasa solicited proposals for a commercial iss resupply cargo vehicle to replace the then soon to be retired space shuttle through its commercial orbital transportation services cots development program the dragon spacecraft was a part of proposal submitted to nasa in march 2006 cots proposal was issued as part of a team which also included md robotics the canadian company that had built the canadarm2 an early dragon pressure vessel photographed during factory tests in 2008 the dragoneye system on space shuttle discovery during sts 133 on 18 august 2006 nasa announced that spacex had been chosen along with kistler aerospace to develop cargo launch services for the iss 21 the initial plan called for three demonstration flights of dragon spacecraft to be conducted between 2008 and 2010 22 23 spacex and kistler were to receive up to $278 million and $207 million respectively 23 if they met all nasa milestones but kistler failed to meet its obligations and its contract was terminated in 2007 24 nasa later re awarded contract to orbital sciences 24 25 commercial resupply services phase 1 edit on 23 december 2008 nasa awarded a $1.6 billion commercial resupply services crs contract to spacex with contract options that could potentially increase the maximum contract value to $3.1 billion 26 the contract called for 12 flights to the iss with a minimum of of cargo carried to the iss 26 on 23 february 2009 spacex announced that its chosen phenolic impregnated carbon ablator heat shield material pica x had passed heat stress tests in preparation for maiden launch 27 28 the primary proximity operations sensor for the dragon spacecraft the dragoneye was tested in early 2009 during the sts 127 mission when it was mounted near the docking port of the space shuttle endeavour and used while the shuttle approached the international space station the lidar and thermography thermal imaging abilities were both tested successfully 29 30 the cots uhf communication unit cucu and crew command panel ccp were delivered to the iss during the late 2009 sts 129 mission 31 the cucu allows the iss to communicate with dragon and the ccp allows iss crew members to issue basic commands to dragon 31 in summer 2009 spacex hired former nasa astronaut ken bowersox as vice president of their new astronaut safety and mission assurance department in preparation for crews using the spacecraft 32 as a condition of the nasa crs contract spacex analyzed the orbital radiation environment on all dragon systems and how the spacecraft would respond to spurious radiation events that analysis and the dragon design which uses an overall fault tolerant triple redundant computer architecture rather than individual radiation hardening of each computer processor was reviewed by independent experts before being approved by nasa for the cargo flights 33 during march 2015 it was announced that spacex had been awarded an additional three missions under commercial resupply services phase 1 34 these additional missions are spacex crs 13 spacex crs 14 and spacex crs 15 and would cover the cargo needs of 2017 on 24 february 2016 spacenews disclosed that spacex had been awarded a further five missions under commercial resupply services phase 1 35 this additional tranche of missions had spacex crs 16 and spacex crs 17 manifested for fy2017 while spacex

period commenced in 2014 and a result announced on 14 january 2016 the crs2 launches are expected to commence in 2019 and extend to at least 2024 on 14 january 2016 nasa announced that three companies had been awarded contracts for a minimum of six launches each spacex orbital atk and sierra nevada corporation won contracts 36 37 the maximum potential value of all the contracts was indicated to be 14bn but the minimum requirements would be considerably less no further financial information was disclosed the missions involved would be from late 2019 through to 2024 demonstration flights edit the

spacecraft being launched on a falcon 9 v1 0 rocket the dragon spacecraft being launched on a falcon 9 v1 1 rocket the first flight of the falcon 9 a private flight occurred in june 2010 and launched a stripped down version of the dragon capsule this dragon spacecraft qualification unit had initially been used as a ground test bed to validate several of the systems during the flight the primary mission was to relay aerodynamic data captured during the ascent 38 39 it was not designed to survive re entry and did not nasa contracted for three test flights from spacex but later reduced that number to two the first dragon spacecraft launched on its first mission contracted to nasa as cots demo flight 1 on 8 december 2010 and was successfully recovered following re entry to atmosphere the mission also marked the second flight of the falcon 9 launch vehicle 40 the dragoneye sensor flew again on sts 133 in february 2011 for further on orbit testing 41 in november 2010 the federal aviation administration faa had issued a re entry license for the dragon capsule the first such license ever awarded to a commercial vehicle 42 the second dragon flight also contracted to nasa as a demonstration mission launched successfully on 22 may 2012 after nasa had approved proposal to combine the cots 2 and 3 mission objectives into a single falcon 9 dragon flight renamed cots 2 3 43 dragon conducted orbital tests of its navigation systems and abort procedures before being grappled by the iss canadarm2 and successfully berthing with the station on 25 may to offload its cargo 10 44

mission was the first to re fly a recovered dragon capsule that previously flew on crs 4 mission this mission delivered 2,708 kilograms 55 of cargo to the international space station including nicer 56 the first stage of the falcon 9 launch vehicle landed successfully at landing zone 1 spacex crs 12 twelfth crs mission was successfully launched on the first block 4 version of the falcon 9 on august 14 2017 from kennedy space center lc 39a at the first attempt this mission delivered 2,349 kg 5,179 lb of pressurized mass and 961 kg 2,119 lb unpressurized the external payload manifested for this flight was the cream cosmic ray detector last flight of a newly built dragon capsule further missions will use refurbished spacecraft 57 crewed development program edit exterior of the dragon 2 used for the pad abort test interior of the dragon 2 capsule showing the seat configuration in 2006 elon musk stated that spacex had built a prototype flight crew capsule including a thoroughly tested 30 man day life support system 20 a video simulation of this escape operation was released in january 2011 58 musk stated in 2010 that the developmental cost of a crewed dragon and falcon 9 would be between $800 million and $1 billion 59 in 2009 and 2010 musk suggested on several occasions that plans for a crewed variant of the dragon were proceeding and had a two to three year timeline to completion 60 61 spacex submitted a bid for the third phase of ccdev ccicap 62 63 nasa commercial crew development program edit spacex was not awarded funding during the first phase of commercial crew development ccdev milestone based program however the company was selected on 18 april 2011 during the second phase of the program to receive an award valued at $75 million to help develop its crew system 64 65 their ccdev2 milestones involved the further advancement of the falcon 9 dragon crew transportation design the advancement of the launch abort system propulsion design completion of two crew accommodations demos full duration test firings of the launch abort engines and demonstrations of their throttle capability 66 launch abort system received preliminary design approval from nasa in october 2011 67 in december 2011 spacex performed its first crew accommodations test the second such test is expected to involve spacesuit simulators and a higher fidelity crewed dragon mock up 68 69 in january 2012 spacex successfully conducted full duration tests of its superdraco landing escape rocket engine at its rocket development facility in mcgregor texas 70 dragon during its pad abort test on 6 may 2015 on 3 august 2012 nasa announced the award of $440 million to spacex for the continuation of work on the dragon under ccicap 71 on 20 december 2013 spacex completed a parachute drop test to validate the new parachute design 72 this involved carrying a 5,400 kilograms dragon test article by helicopter to an altitude of 2,400 meters above the pacific ocean 73 the test article was released and intentionally forced into a tumble 73 dragon then released its two drogue parachutes followed by its three main parachutes and splashed down into the ocean 73 the test article was then retrieved by helicopter and returned to shore 73 on 6 may 2015 spacex completed a pad abort test for the dragon 2 74 75 76 77 during this test the dragon used its abort engines to launch away from a test stand at launch complex 40 74 75 77 it traveled to an altitude of 1,187 meters 78 separated from its trunk deployed its drogue parachutes and then the main parachutes 75 77 it splashed down into the ocean and was recovered 75 77 the vehicle was planned to reach an altitude of 1,500 meters but one of the engines underperformed due to an abnormal fuel mixture ratio 75 76 the dragon flown is planned to be refurbished for the in flight abort test 76 77 in a planned in flight abort test dragon will use its launch abort engines to escape from a modified falcon 9 that is already in flight 79 80 the launch is planned to occur from slc 4e 77 this test will occur at the point of worst case dynamic loads which is also when dragon has the smallest performance margin for separation from its launch vehicle 79 the falcon 9 planned to be used will only have three engines on the first stage and will have no second stage 77 an uncrewed test mission to the iss spx dm1 is planned to be launched in november 2017 81 82 it will be a 30 day mission that will spend the majority of its time docked to the space station 82 it will then land in the ocean and be retrieved 82 a crewed test mission to the iss spx dm2 is planned to be launched in may 2018 and last for 14 days 83 development funding edit in 2014 spacex released the total combined development costs for both the falcon 9 launch vehicle and the dragon capsule nasa provided us 396 million while spacex provided over us 450 million to fund both development efforts 84 production edit a dragon capsule being shipped out of spacex hq in hawthorne california february 2015 in december 2010 the spacex production line was reported to be manufacturing one new dragon spacecraft and falcon 9 rocket every three months elon musk stated in a 2010 interview that he planned to increase production turnover to one dragon every six weeks by 2012 85 composite materials are extensively used in the manufacture to reduce weight and improve structural strength 86 by september 2013 spacex total manufacturing space had increased to nearly 1,000,000 square feet 2 and the factory had six dragons in various stages of production spacex published a photograph showing the six including the next four nasa commercial resupply services crs mission dragons crs 3 crs 4 crs 5 crs 6 plus the drop test dragon and the pad abort dragon weldment for commercial crew 87 variants and derivatives edit dragon crs edit drawing showing the pressurized red and unpressurized orange sections of dragon v1 the dragon spacecraft consists of a nose cone cap that jettisons after launch a conventional blunt cone ballistic capsule and an unpressurized cargo carrier trunk equipped with two solar arrays 88 the capsule uses a pica x heat shield based on a proprietary variant of phenolic impregnated carbon ablator pica material designed to protect the capsule during earth atmospheric entry even at high return velocities from lunar and martian missions 89 90 91 the dragon capsule is re usable and can fly multiple missions 88 the trunk is not recoverable it separates from the capsule before re entry and burns up in atmosphere 92 the trunk section which carries the solar panels and allows the transport of unpressurized cargo to the iss was first used for cargo on the spacex crs 2 mission dragon crs 3 views dragon crs 3 views dragon crs isometric view the spacecraft is launched atop a falcon 9 booster 93 the dragon capsule is equipped with 18 draco thrusters 90 during its initial cargo and crew flights the dragon capsule will land in the pacific ocean and be returned to the shore by ship 94 for the iss dragon cargo flights the canadarm2 grapples its flight releasable grapple fixture and berths dragon to the us orbital segment using a common berthing mechanism 95 the crs dragon does not have an independent means of maintaining a breathable atmosphere for astronauts and instead circulates in fresh air from the iss 96 for typical missions dragon is planned to remain berthed to the iss for about 30 days 97 the crs capsule can transport of cargo which can be all pressurized all unpressurized or anywhere between it can return to earth which can be all unpressurized disposal mass or up to of return pressurized cargo driven by parachute limitations there is a volume constraint of 3 trunk unpressurized cargo and 3 of pressurized cargo up or down 98 the trunk was first used operationally on the crs 2 mission in march 2013 99 its solar arrays produce a peak power of 9 the crs dragon design was modified beginning with the fifth dragon flight on the spacex crs 3 mission to the iss in march 2014 while the outer mold line of the dragon was unchanged the avionics and cargo racks were redesigned to supply substantially more electrical power to powered cargo devices including the glacier and merlin freezer modules for transporting critical science payloads 100 dragonlab edit when used for non nasa non iss commercial flights the uncrewed version of the dragon spacecraft is called dragonlab 88 it is reusable and free flying and can carry pressurized and unpressurized payloads its subsystems include propulsion power thermal and environmental control avionics communications thermal protection flight software guidance and navigation systems and entry descent landing and recovery gear 5 it has a total combined upmass of 6,000 kilograms upon launch and a maximum downmass of 3,000 kilograms when returning to earth 5 in november 2014 there were two dragonlab missions listed on the spacex launch manifest one in 2016 and another in 2018 101 however these missions were removed from the manifest in early 2017 with no official spacex statement 102 the american biosatellites once performed similar uncrewed payload delivery functions and the russian bion satellites still continue to do so dragon 2 edit main article dragon 2 a successor of dragon called dragon 2 is under development by spacex designed to support crewed missions it will be able to carry up to seven astronauts or some mix of crew and cargo to and from low earth orbit the dragon 2 heat shield is designed to withstand earth re entry velocities from lunar and martian spaceflights 89 spacex has received several u s government contracts to develop the dragon 2 crewed variant including a commercial crew development 2 ccdev 2 funded space act agreement in april 2011 and a commercial crew integrated capability ccicap funded space act agreement in august 2012 red dragon edit main article red dragon spacecraft in addition to privately funded plans for an eventual mars mission nasa ames research center had developed a concept called red dragon a low cost mars mission that would use falcon heavy as the launch vehicle and trans martian injection vehicle and the dragon 2 based capsule to enter the atmosphere of mars the concept was originally envisioned for launch in 2018 as a nasa discovery mission then alternatively for 2022 but as of september 2015 update it has not been yet formally submitted for funding within nasa 103 the objectives of the mission would be return the samples from mars to earth at a fraction of the cost of the nasa own return sample mission now projected at 6 billion dollars 103 on 27 april 2016 spacex announced its plan to go ahead and launch a modified dragon lander to mars in 2018 104 105 a dragon capsule would perform all entry descent and landing edl functions needed to deliver payloads of 1 tonne or more to the martian surface without using a parachute preliminary analysis showed that the atmospheric drag would slow it enough for the final stage of its descent to be within the abilities of its superdraco retro propulsion thrusters 106 107 on july 19th 2017 however elon
