delta and empties into the bay of bengal it is also one of the most fertile regions in the world thus earning the nickname the green delta the delta stretches from the hooghly river on the west to the meghna river on the east it is approximately across at the bay of bengal 1 kolkata formerly calcutta and haldia in india and mongla and chittagong in bangladesh are the principal seaports of the delta a number of large rivers flow through the brahmaputra delta including the padma main distributary of the ganges and the jamuna main distributary of the brahmaputra which merge and then join the meghna

is considered to be an arcuate delta arc shaped it covers more than 2 and although the delta lies mostly in bangladesh and india rivers from bhutan tibet india and nepal drain into it from the north approximately two thirds of the delta is in bangladesh most of the delta is composed of alluvial soils made up by small sediment particles that finally settle down as river currents slow down in the estuary rivers carry these fine particles with them even from their sources at glaciers as fluvio glacial red and red yellow laterite soils are found as one heads farther east the soil has large amounts of minerals and nutrients which is good for agriculture it is composed of a labyrinth of channels swamps lakes and flood plain sediments chars the gorai madhumati river one of the distributaries of the ganges divides the ganges delta into two parts the geologically young active eastern delta and the older less active western delta 2 population edit between 125 and 143 million people live on the delta citation needed despite risks from floods caused by monsoons heavy runoff from the melting snows of the himalayas and north indian ocean tropical cyclones a large part of the nation of bangladesh lies in the ganges delta and many of the people depend on the delta for survival 3 it is believed that upwards of 300 million people are supported by the ganges delta and approximately people live in the ganges river basin making it the most populous river basin in the world most of the ganges delta has a population density of more than 200 people per km 2 520 people

delta the lower gangetic plains moist deciduous forests ecoregion covers most of the delta region although the forests have mostly been cleared for agriculture and only small enclaves remain thick stands of tall grass known as canebrakes grow in wetter areas the sundarbans freshwater swamp forests ecoregion lies closer to the bay of bengal this ecoregion is flooded with slightly brackish water during the dry season and fresh water during the monsoon season these forests too have been almost completely converted to intensive agriculture with only 130 square kilometres of the 14,600 square kilometres protected where the delta meets the bay of bengal sundarbans mangroves form the largest mangrove ecoregion covering an area of 20,400 square kilometres in a chain of 54 islands they derive their name from the predominant mangrove species heritiera fomes which are known locally as sundri or sundari animals in the delta include the indian python python molurus clouded leopard neofelis nebulosa indian elephant elephas maximus indicus and crocodiles which live in the sundarbans approximately 1,020 endangered bengal tigers panthera tigris tigris are believed to inhabit the sundarbans the basin has tropical deciduous forests that yield valuable timber sal teak and peepal trees are found in these areas the delta region has mangrove trees it is estimated that 30,000 chital axis axis are in the sundarbans part of the delta birds found in the delta include kingfishers eagles woodpeckers the shalik acridotheres tristis the swamp francolin francolinus gularis and the doel copsychus saularis two species of dolphin can be found in the delta the irrawaddy dolphin orcaella brevirostris and the ganges river dolphin platanista gangetica gangetica the irrawaddy dolphin is an oceanic dolphin which enters the delta from the bay of bengal the ganges river dolphin is a true river dolphin but is extremely rare and considered endangered trees found in the delta include sundari garjan rhizophora spp bamboo mangrove palm nypa fruticans and mangrove date palm phoenix paludosa many endangered species live here geology edit the ganges delta lies at the junction of three tectonic plates the indian plate the eurasian plate and the burma plate 4 the edge of the eocene paleoshelf runs approximately from kolkata to the edge of the shillong plateau the edge of the paleoshelf marks the transition from the thick continental crust in the northwest to the thin continental or oceanic crust in the southeast the enormous sediment supply from the himalayan collision has extended the delta about 400 kilometres seaward since the eocene the sediment thickness southeast of the edge of the paleoshelf beneath the ganges delta can exceed 10 miles 5 economy edit rice cattle and fishing in rivers and ponds are important sources of food approximately two thirds of the bangladesh people work in agriculture and grow crops on the fertile floodplains of the delta the major crops that are grown in the ganges delta are jute tea and rice 3 fishing is also an important activity in the delta region with fish being a major source of food for many of the people in the area 6 in recent years scientists have been helping the poor people of the delta to improve fish farming methods by turning unused ponds into viable fish farms and improving methods of raising fish in existing ponds many people can now earn a living raising and selling fish using new systems fish production in existing ponds has increased 800 7 shrimp are farmed in containers or cages that are submerged in open water most are exported 6 a lot of bustle at a ferry pier the vidyasagar setu which spans the hoogli river in kolkata as there is a maze of many river branches the area is difficult to pass most islands are only connected with the mainland by simple wooden ferryboats bridges are rare some islands are not yet connected to the electric grid so island residents tend to use solar cells for a bit of electric supply climate edit the ganges delta lies mostly in the tropical wet climate zone and receives between 1,500 to 59 to of rainfall each year in the western part and 2,000 to 79 to in the eastern part citation needed hot dry summers and cool dry winters make the climate suitable for agriculture cyclones and flooding edit in november 1970 the deadliest tropical cyclone of the twentieth century hit the ganges delta region the 1970 bhola cyclone killed 500,000 people official death toll with another 100,000 missing the guinness book of world records estimated the total loss of human life from the bhola cyclone at 1,000,000 8 another cyclone hit the delta in 1991 killing about 139,000 people 9 people have to be careful on the river delta as severe flooding also occurs in 1998 the ganges flooded the delta killing about 1,000 people and leaving more than 30 million people homeless the bangladesh government asked for to help feed the people of the region as the entire rice crop was lost 10 future of the delta edit one of the greatest challenges people living on the ganges delta may face in coming years is the threat of rising sea levels caused by climate change an increase in sea level of 0.5 metres could result in six million people losing their homes in bangladesh 11 important gas reserves have been discovered in the delta such as in the titas and bakhrabad gas fields several
