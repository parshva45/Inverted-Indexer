which anthropologists term yucatec maya but is identified by speakers and yucatecos simply as maya among maya speakers spanish is commonly spoken as a second or first language there is a significant amount of confusion as to the correct terminology to or the meaning of these words with reference to contemporary or pre columbian peoples to maya peoples in different parts of mexico guatemala belize

christians chilam balam chumayel 4 linguists refer to the maya language as yucatec or yucatec maya to distinguish it from other mayan languages this norm has often been misinterpreted to mean that the people are also called yucatec maya that term refers only to the language and the correct name for the people is simply maya not mayans maya is one language in the mayan language family thus to refer to maya as mayans would be similar to referring to spanish people as romantics because they speak a language belonging to the romance language family 5 confusion of the term maya mayan as an ethnic label occurs because maya women who use traditional dress identify by the ethnic term mestiza and not maya 6 persons use a strategy of ethnic identification that juan castillo cocom refers to as that ethnic self identification as maya is quite variable situational and articulated not to processes of producing group identity but of escaping from discriminatory processes of sociocultural marginalization 7 8 the indigenous population was first exposed to europeans after a party of spanish shipwreck survivors came ashore in 1511 one of the sailors gonzalo guerrero is reported to have

out at chichen itza he lost 150 men in a single day 9 european diseases massive recruitment of native warriors from campeche and champoton and internal hatred between the xiu maya and the lords of cocom eventually turned the tide for montejo the younger chichen itza was conquered by 1570 9 in 1542 the western peninsula also surrendered to him chichen el castillo historically the population in the eastern half of the peninsula was less affected by and less integrated with hispanic culture than the western half in the 21st century in the peninsula mexican states of campeche and quintana roo

and drew its strongest and earliest support from chiapan maya today its number of supporters is relevant see also the ezln and the chiapas conflict maya groups in chiapas include the tzotzil and tzeltal in the highlands of the state the tojolabalis concentrated in the lowlands around las margaritas and the in the jungle see map the most traditional of maya groups are the lacandon a small population avoiding contact with outsiders until the late 20th century by living in small groups in the lacandon jungle these lacandon maya came from the area north east of chiapas and moved into the lacandon rain forest at the end of the 18th century in the course of the 20th century and increasingly in the 1950s and 1960s other people mainly the maya and subsistence peasants from the highlands also entered into the lacandon region initially encouraged by the government this immigration led to land related conflicts and an increasing pressure on the rainforest to halt the migration the government decided in 1971 to declare a large part of the forest 614,000 hectares or 2 a protected area the montes azules biosphere reserve they appointed only one small population group the 66 lacandon families as tenants thus creating the lacandon community thereby displacing 2000 tzeltal and families from 26 communities and leaving non lacandon communities dependent on the government for granting their rights to land in the decades that followed the government carried out numerous programs to keep the problems in the region under control using land distribution as a political tool as a way of ensuring loyalty from different campesino groups this strategy of divide and rule led to great disaffection and tensions among population groups in the region see also the chiapas conflict

opposite of palacio nacional mexico city mexico there is an undeniable symbiotic relationship between cultural heritage tourism and a national identity in the case of the maya the many national identities have been constructed because of the growing demands placed on them by cultural tourism by focusing on lifeways through costumes rituals diet handicrafts language housing or other features the identity of the economy shifts from the sale of labor to that of the sale of culture 30 global tourism is now considered one of the largest scale movement of goods services and people in history and a significant catalyst for economic development and sociopolitical change 31 estimated that between 35 and 40 percent of tourism today is represented by cultural tourism or heritage tourism this alternative to mass tourism offers opportunities for place based engagement that frames context for interaction by the lived space and everyday life of other peoples as well as sites and objects of global historical significance 32 in this production of tourism the use of historic symbols signs and topics form a new side that characterizes a nation and can play an active role in nation building 33 with this type of tourism people argue that ethno commerce may open unprecedented opportunities for creating value of various kinds tourists travel with cultural expectations which has created a touristic experience sometimes faced with the need to invent traditions of artificial and contrived attractions often developed at the expense of local tradition and meanings 34 an example of this can be seen in tourism on roatan island honduras archaeological perspectives on heritage development and alejandro j figueroa et al combine archaeological data and ethnographic insights to explore a highly contested tourism economy in their discussion of how places on roatan island honduras have become increasingly over the past decade as tour operators and developers continue to invent an idealized maya past for the island non maya archaeological remains and cultural patrimony are constantly being threatened and destroyed while heritage tourism provides economic opportunities for some it can devalue contributions made by less familiar groups 35 notable maya people edit see also category maya people ah ahaual a 7th century captive of noble lineage recorded in pre columbian maya
