south atlantic tropical cyclone wikipedia south atlantic tropical cyclone from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search tracks of significant south atlantic tropical and subtropical cyclones since 2004 south atlantic tropical cyclones are unusual weather events that occur in the southern hemisphere strong wind shear which disrupts the formation of cyclones as well as a lack of weather disturbances favorable for development in the south atlantic ocean make any strong tropical system extremely rare and catarina in 2004 was the only recorded south atlantic hurricane in history those storms have only developed during the months from november through to april in this basin since 2011 the brazilian navy hydrographic center has started to assign names to tropical and subtropical systems in western side of this basin near brazil when they have sustained wind speeds of at least the generally accepted minimum sustained wind velocity for a disturbance to be designated as a tropical storm in the north atlantic basin below is a list of notable south atlantic tropical and subtropical cyclones contents 1 theories concerning infrequency of occurrence 2 known storms and impacts 2.1 1991 angola tropical storm 2.2 hurricane catarina 2.3 tropical storm anita 2.4 subtropical storm arani 2.5 subtropical storm bapo 2.6 subtropical storm cari 2.7 subtropical storm deni 2.8 subtropical storm 3 other systems 3.1 pre 2004 3.2 3.3 4 storm names 5 listed by month 6 see also 7 references 8 external links theories concerning infrequency of occurrence edit until april 1991 it was thought that tropical cyclones did not develop within the south atlantic 1 very strong vertical wind shear in the troposphere is considered a deterrent 2 the intertropical convergence zone drops one to two degrees south of the equator 3 not far enough from the equator for the coriolis force to aid development water temperatures in the tropics of the southern atlantic are cooler than those in the tropical north atlantic 4 during april 1991 these assertions were proven false when the united states national hurricane center reported that a tropical cyclone had developed over the eastern south atlantic 1 5 in subsequent years a few systems were suspected to have the characteristics needed to be classified as a tropical cyclone including in march 1994 and january 2004 6 7 during march 2004 an extratropical cyclone formally transitioned into a tropical cyclone and made landfall on brazil after becoming a category 2 hurricane on the saffir simpson hurricane wind scale while the system was threatening the brazilian state of santa catarina a newspaper used the headline catarina which was originally presumed to mean hurricane threatening santa catarina the state 1 after international presses started monitoring the system hurricane catarina has formally been adopted at the sixth wmo international workshop on tropical cyclones iwtc vi in 2006 it was questioned if any subtropical or tropical cyclones had developed within the south atlantic before catarina 7 it was noted that suspect systems had developed in january 1970 march 1994 january 2004 march 2004 may 2004 february 2006 and march 2006 7 it was also suggested that an effort should be made to locate any possible systems using satellite imagery and synoptic data however it was noted that this effort may be hindered by the lack of any geostationary imagery over the basin before 1966 7 a study was subsequently performed and published during 2012 which concluded that there had been 63 subtropical cyclones in the southern atlantic between 1957 and 2007 8 during january 2009 a subtropical storm developed in the basin and in march 2010 a tropical storm developed which was named anita by the brazilian public and private weather services 9 10 in 2011 the brazilian navy hydrographic center started to assign names to tropical and subtropical cyclones that develop within its area of responsibility to the west of when they have sustained wind speeds of at least 11 known storms and impacts edit 1991 angola tropical storm edit tropical duration april 10 april 14 1991 peak intensity 1 min a low pressure area formed over the congo basin on april 9 the next day it moved offshore northern angola with a curved cloud pattern it moved westward over an area of warm waters and caused minor damages on saint helena while the circulation became better defined according to the united states national hurricane center the system was probably either a tropical depression or a tropical storm at its peak intensity on april 14 the system rapidly dissipated as it was absorbed into a large squall line 12 13 hurricane catarina edit category duration march 24 march 28 2004 peak intensity 1 min 972 hpa mbar main article hurricane catarina hurricane catarina was an extraordinarily rare tropical cyclone forming in the southern atlantic ocean in march 2004 14 just after becoming a hurricane it hit the southern coast of brazil in the state of santa catarina on the evening of march 28 with winds estimated near 155 kilometres per hour making it a category 2 equivalent on the saffir simpson hurricane scale the cyclone killed 3 to 10 people and caused millions of dollars in damage in brazil at the time the brazilians were taken completely by surprise and were initially skeptical that an actual tropical cyclone could have formed in the south atlantic eventually however they were convinced and adopted the previously unofficial name catarina for the storm after santa catarina state this event is considered by some meteorologists to be a nearly once in a lifetime occurrence tropical storm anita edit tropical duration march 8 march 12 2010 peak intensity 1 min 995 hpa mbar on 2010 a previously extratropical cyclone developed tropical characteristics and was classified as a subtropical cyclone off the coast of southern brazil the following day the united states naval research laboratory began monitoring the system as a system of interest under the designation of 90q the national hurricane center also began monitoring the system as low sl90 during the afternoon of march 9 the system had attained an intensity of and a barometric pressure of mbar it was declared a tropical storm on march 10 and became extratropical late on march 12 15 accumulated cyclone energy was estimated at 2.0525 by the florida state university there was no damage associated to the storm except high sea in the coasts of rio grande do sul and santa catarina post mortem the cyclone was given the name anita by private and public weather centers in southern brazil 16 subtropical storm arani edit subtropical duration march 14 march 16 2011 peak intensity 1 min 989 hpa mbar early on march 14 2011 the navy hydrographic center brazilian navy smm in coordination with the national institute of meteorology were monitoring an organizing area of convection near the southeast coast of brazil 17 later that day a low pressure area developed just east of santo 18 and by 1200 utc the system organized into a subtropical depression located about east of campos dos goytacazes 19 guided by a trough and a weak ridge to its north the system moved slowly southeastward over an area of warm waters 20 21 intensifying into subtropical cyclone arani on march 15 22 as named by the brazilian navy hydrographic center 23 the storm was classified as subtropical as the convection was east of the center on march 16 arani began experiencing 25 knots of wind shear because another frontal system bumped it from behind 24 before it developed into a subtropical cyclone arani produced torrential rains over portions of southeastern brazil resulting in flash flooding and landslides significant damage was reported in portions of santo though specifics are unknown 25 increased swells along the coast prompted ocean travel warnings 26 subtropical storm bapo edit subtropical duration february 5 february 8 2015 peak intensity 1 min 992 hpa mbar during february 5 2015 a subtropical depression developed about to the southeast of paulo brazil 27 over the next day low level baroclincity decreased around the system as it moved south eastwards away from the brazilian coast and intensified further 28 the system was named bapo by the brazilian navy hydrography center during february 6 after it had intensified into a subtropical storm 29 30 over the next couple of days the system continued to move south eastwards before it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone during february 8 31 subtropical storm cari edit subtropical duration march 10 march 13 2015 peak intensity 1 min 998 hpa mbar on march 10 2015 the hydrographic center of the brazilian navy began issuing warnings of subtropical depression 3 during early afternoon 32 while cptec already assigned the name cari for the storm 33 at 0000 utc on march 11 the hydrographic center of the brazilian navy upgraded cari to a subtropical storm also assigning a name to it 34 on march 12 the brazilian hydrographic center downgraded cari to a subtropical depression 35 while the cptec stated that the storm became a hybrid cyclone 36 during early afternoon of march 13 the brazilian navy declared that cari became a remnant low 37 cari brought heavy rainfall flooding and landslides to eastern cities of santa catarina and rio grande do sul states 38 rain totals from to were observed associated with the storms and wind topped in cabo de santa marta 38 a navy buoy registered a 20 ft wave off the coast of santa catarina 38 subtropical storm deni edit subtropical duration november 15 november 16 2016 peak intensity 1 min 998 hpa mbar a subtropical depression formed southwest of rio de janeiro on november 15 2016 39 it intensified into a subtropical storm and received the name deni on november 16 40 moving south southeastwards deni soon became extratropical shortly before 00 00 utc on november 17 41 subtropical storm edit subtropical duration december 4 december 6 2016 peak intensity 1 min 992 hpa mbar an extratropical cyclone entered the ocean from santa catarina early on december 4 2016 42 later it intensified quickly and then transitioned into a subtropical storm shortly before 22 00 brst 00 00 utc on december 5 with the name assigned by the hydrographic center of the brazilian navy 43 started to decay on december 5 and weakened into a subtropical depression at around 00 00 utc on december 6 44 other systems edit pre 2004 edit modis visible satellite imagery a possible january 2004 tropical cyclone according to a presentation at the sixth wmo international workshop on tropical cyclones iwtc vi satellite imagery from january 1970 showed that a system with an eyewall had developed behind a cold front and that the system needed further analysis to determine if it was tropical or subtropical 7 on march 27 1974 a weak area of low pressure that had originated over the amazon river started to intensify further 45 over the next 48 hours the system quickly developed further and was classified as subtropical as it developed a banding structure and deep convection near its warm core 45 on march 29 a north westerly flow encroached on the systems environment which caused the system to rapidly move towards 40s and the cold waters that were present to the south of 45 in march 1994 a system that was thought to be weaker than catarina was spawned but was located over cool and open waters 46 edit during 2004 the large scale conditions over the south atlantic were more conducive than usual for subtropical or tropical systems with 4 systems noted 7 the first possible tropical cyclone developed within a trough of low pressure to the southeast of salvador brazil on january 18 6 7 the system subsequently displayed a small central dense overcast and was suspected to be at the peak of its development as either a tropical depression or a tropical storm during the next day 6 the system was subsequently affected by some strong shear before it moved inland and weakened along the coast of brazil before it was last noted during january 21 6 within brazil the system caused heavy rain and flooding with a state of emergency declared in aracaju after the river overflowed and burst its banks which flooded homes destroyed crops and caused parts of the highway to collapse 6 however it was noted that not all of the heavy rain and impacts were attributable to the system as a large monsoon low covered much of brazil at the time 6 the second system was a possible hybrid cyclone that developed near south eastern brazil between march 7 hurricane catarina was the third system while the fourth system had a well defined eye like structure and formed off the coast of brazil during on march 15 2004 7 modis visible satellite image of a possible february 2006 tropical storm on february 22 2006 a baroclinic cyclone intensified quickly and was estimated to have peaked with 1 minute sustained wind speeds of after radar data showed that the system had developed an eye and banding 7 however there were questions about how tropical the system was as it did not separate from the westerlies or the baroclinic zone it was in 7 47 between march 2006 a system with a warm core developed and moved southwards along the south atlantic zone 7 two subtropical cyclones affected both uruguay and rio grande do sul state in brazil on january 28 2009 a cold core mid to upper level trough in phase with a low level warm core low formed a system and moved eastward into the south atlantic 48 the storm produced rainfall in 24 hours of or more in some locations of rocha uruguay and southern rio grande do sul the weather station owned by metsul weather center in morro redondo southern brazil recorded in a 24 hour period fourteen deaths and thousands of evacuees are attributed to the storm with an emergency declared in four cities 9 it lasted until february 1 when the cyclone became extratropical 49 edit subtropical storm in november 2010 on november 16 2010 a cold core mid to upper level trough in phase with a low level warm core low formed a system state in brazil and moved southeastward into the south atlantic where it slightly deepened 50 the system brought locally heavy rains in southern brazil and northeast of uruguay that exceeded 200 millimeters in a few hours in some locations of southern rio grande do sul northwest of pelotas 51 damages and flooding were observed in cerrito do sul and pedro 51 de pajas departament of cerro largo in uruguay recorded of rain 51 the subtropical cyclone then became a weak trough on november 19 according to the cptec 52 between december 23 2013 and january 24 2015 the center for weather forecast and climatic studies cptec and navy hydrography center monitored four subtropical depressions to the south of rio de janeiro the first one lasted until christmas day 2013 53 54 55 56 two subtropical depressions formed in 2014 one in late february 2014 and the other in late march 2014 57 58 59 a fourth one formed in late january 2015 60 61 on january 5 2016 the hydrographic center of the brazilian navy issued warnings on a subtropical depression that formed east of santo 62 on the next day the system strengthened into a tropical depression and other agencies considered it as an invest designating it as 90q 63 64 however on january 7 the tropical depression dissipated 63 65 storm names edit the following names are published by the brazilian navy hydrographic center and used for named storms that form in
