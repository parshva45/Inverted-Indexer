twenty third flight of space shuttle endeavour the primary purpose of the sts 127 mission was to deliver and install the final two components of the japanese experiment module the exposed facility jem ef and the exposed section of the experiment logistics module elm es 3 nasa 1 when endeavour docked with the iss on this mission in july 2009 it set a record for the most humans in space at the same time in the same vehicle the first time thirteen people have been at the station at the same time 4 it also tied the record of thirteen people in space at any one time the first launch attempt on 13 june 2009 was scrubbed due to a gaseous hydrogen leak observed during tanking 5 6 the ground umbilical carrier plate gucp on the external fuel tank experienced a potentially hazardous hydrogen gas leak similar to the fault that delayed the space shuttle discovery mission sts 119 in march 2009 since a launch date of 18 june 2009 would have conflicted with the launch of the lunar reconnaissance orbiter lro lunar crater observation and sensing satellite lcross nasa managers discussed the scheduling conflict with both the lunar reconnaissance orbiter project and the air force eastern range which provides tracking support for rockets launched from florida 7 8 a decision was made to allow the shuttle to attempt a second launch on 17 june 2009 allowing lro to launch on 18 june 2009 6 the second launch attempt on 17 june 2009 was also scrubbed due to hydrogen leak issues seen from the ground umbilical carrier plate 9 due to conflicts with the launch of the lro and due to a beta angle constraint the next available launch opportunity was scheduled for 11 july 2009 nasa 2 10 a successful tanking test for leak checks was performed on 1 july 2009 with modified gucp seals allowing launch preparations to proceed as scheduled 11 because of lightning strikes near the launch pad during the evening of 10 july 2009 nasa scrubbed the launch for the third time and rescheduled for 12 july 2009 12 due to a return to launch site rtls weather violation nasa scrubbed the launch for the fourth time on the evening of 12 july 2009 fifth launch attempt on 13 july 2009 was also scrubbed due to anvil clouds and lightning within 10 nautical miles of the launch site which violated launch safety rules sts 127 finally launched successfully on its sixth launch attempt on 15 july 2009 at 18 03 edt pieces of foam were observed falling off of the external tank during the ascent the same occurrence that had led to the loss of columbia in 2003 however endeavour only received minor scuffs to

payload bay of the shuttle being loaded icc vld1 sts 127 endeavour carried a wide variety of equipment and cargo in the payload bay with the largest item being the kibo japanese experiment module exposed facility jem ef and the kibo japanese experiment logistics module exposed section elm es nasa 1 the exposed facility is a part of kibo that will allow astronauts to perform science experiments that are exposed to the vacuum of space the exposed section is similar to the logistics module on the kibo laboratory but is not pressurized nasa 1 once its payloads were transferred to the jem ef the elm es was returned to the payload bay also inside the payload bay was an integrated cargo carrier vertical light deployable icc vld containing a variety of equipment and spare components for the station the carrier contained six new batteries for installation on the p6 truss that was installed during two of the spacewalks as well as a spare space to ground antenna and a spare linear drive unit and pump module which was stored on an external stowage platform on the truss during one of the spacewalks nasa 1 two satellites were also carried by the orbiter for deployment when the mission ended the dual autonomous global positioning system on orbit navigator satellite called dragonsat gathers data on autonomous spacecraft rendezvous and docking capabilities and consists of two picosatellites the aggiesat2 and paradigm bevo 1 which acquire gps data from a device at nasa and send it to ground stations at texas a m university and the university of texas at austin nasa 1 15 after release the two picosatellites remained attached for two orbits to collect gps data and separated during the third orbit nasa 1 a second satellite the atmospheric neutral density experiment ande 2 is part of a united states department of defense project flown by the naval research laboratory to provide high quality satellites and will measure the density and composition of the low earth orbit atmosphere while being tracked from the ground to better predict the movement and decay of objects in orbit nasa 1 nasa 4 ande 2 consists of two spherical microsatellites ande active spacecraft castor and the ande passive spacecraft pollux and will be tracked by the international laser ranging service ilrs network as well as the space surveillance network ssn nasa 1 nasa 4 one of the satellites pollux is running arduino libraries with its payload programmed and built by students a set of experiments to be deployed on the iss were carried by sts 127 namely dosimetry for biological experiments

close up view of the ground umbilical carrier plate on external tank during the first maintenance effort the launch countdown began 10 june 2009 but on 13 june 2009 as tanking was underway a gaseous hydrogen leak on a vent line near the ground umbilical carrier plate was observed and the 13 june 2009 launch was scrubbed at 00 26 edt as liquid hydrogen fuel is pumped in some of it boils off as the extremely cold liquid enters the warm external tank the vent line valve controls the resulting buildup of gas pressure by allowing excess gas to escape into a ground side vent line which leads to a flare stack at a safe distance away from the pad a similar leak situation was seen during the first launch attempt of sts 119 nasa managers met on 14 june 2009 and 15 june 2009 and evaluated the leak discussed steps that had to be taken and set a new launch date of 17 june 2009 at 05 40 edt 5 6 a second launch attempt was made on 17 june 2009 for which nasa moved the planned launch of the lunar reconnaissance orbiter to a new date on 17 june 2009 loading of the external tank with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen was delayed three hours due to poor weather around the launch site but tanking began once the weather cleared approximately two hours after tanking began engineers saw leak indications in the gucp similar to those seen during the first launch attempt the launch was officially scrubbed at 01 55 edt 9 following the launch scrub chairman of mission management team leroy cain noted that engineers would work to understand the hydrogen leak issue and come up with a solution to the problem cain said managers were hopeful that the issue could be resolved in time for the next available launch opportunity on 11 july 2009 21 due to the delay of sts 127 managers noted that it was likely that the launch of sts 128 on 7 august 2009 would be pushed back slightly 21 lightning strikes endeavour s launch pad on 1 july 2009 the shuttle managers conducted a new series of tanking tests to confirm a hypothesis that a misaligned vent port housing was the root cause of the leaks the existing rigid seal was replaced with a flexible one in the hope that it would maintain a tight fix even under the cryogenic conditions that seem to cause the leak the test was declared a success with no leaks detected on the gucp the mission was announced to be targeting an 11 july 2009 launch 22 23 on the evening of 10 july 2009 the launch pad region was hit by eleven strikes of lightning which pushed back the 11 july 2009 launch time by at least 24 hours two of the strikes were strong enough to trigger an evaluation by nasa engineers the inspections revealed that no damage had been done to the space shuttle nasa 9 nasa scrubbed endeavour 12 july 2009 launch attempt at t minus 9 minutes and holding due to cumulus clouds and lightning near the launch pad during the final go no go polls mission control in houston declared a no go due to unacceptable weather forecast for a possible return

external tank 31 the pictures of the external tank taken when jettisoning showed loss of foam in the intertank ribbing 32 the chairman of the mission management team was not concerned and felt that the space shuttle would be cleared for re entry on its return it was a few days later 33 34 nasa 11 the payload doors were opened after reaching orbit followed by deployment of the k u band antenna and activation of the mechanical arm 35 16 july flight day 2 edit julie payette looks through an overhead window while operating controls on the aft flight deck of endeavour during flight day two activities the thermal protection system was inspected with the shuttle robotic arm orbiter boom sensor system obss and the voluminous data downlinked for analysis the orbital maneuvering system pods were inspected for tile damage or protruding tiles the extravehicular mobility units were checked in addition to the rendezvous system tests and centerline camera installation in preparation for the docking the docking ring was extended 35 nasa 12 17 july flight day 3 iss docking edit the shuttle successfully docked with the station 220 miles above the earth following rendezvous pitch maneuver rpm photography of thermal protection system by the expedition 20 crew 36 during this procedure the shuttle flips over on its back to the station so that the station crew can capture high resolution imagery of the underside of the shuttle the docking happened on the pma 2 pressurized mating adapter on the harmony module and the hatch was opened after leak checks as part of the crew swap station crew member koichi wakata was replaced with tim kopra the two astronauts specially fitted seatliners were interchanged nasa 13 as part of preparation for eva 1 astronauts wolf and kopra camped out in the quest airlock a quick review of the rpm imagery showed no serious concerns beyond two instances of coating loss further analysis of the imagery will be done a boost of the station was completed with the vernier thrusters to avoid a piece of space debris the srbs were retrieved and their camera imagery is expected to give more detail on the et foam shedding 13 one of aft flight deck windows

day 4 eva 1 edit eva 1 started with astronauts dave wolf and tim kopra switching their spacesuit power to internal battery at 16 19 utc despite a communication problem with the spacewalkers the japanese exposed facility was successfully installed on the japanese experiment module by means of a complex series of steps involving the robotic arms of both the station and the shuttle nasa 14 the jef was first unberthed from the shuttle payload bay by the station arm after which the shuttle arm took the load the station arm was then moved to the worksite on node 2 harmony wherefrom it took the 4.1 ton facility back the facility was then successfully latched on to the experiment module 37 38 39 as part of the eva the spacewalkers successfully deployed the port unpressurized cargo carrier attach system uccas which could not be deployed during sts 119 during the prior mission the deployment failed due to a jamming caused by a stuck detent pin engineers designed a custom tool to force the pin to release which was used to deploy the mechanism 40 meanwhile the shuttle managers announced that there would be no need for a focused inspection of the heat shield the nose cap and wing leading edge panels of the shuttle were cleared for entry as they were but a reentry clearance was not given nasa 14 beyond one impact site having a gouge the rest of the impacts were found to be mostly a loss of coating 41 the other activity scheduled for eva 1 the deployment of a starboard side cargo carrier was postponed for want of time 40 a fuel cell issue found before launch was analyzed

light deployable icc vld on the port side of the station was successfully completed with the use of both the shuttle and station robotic arms the cargo pallet containing spares and fresh batteries for the station was lifted out of the shuttle bay by the shuttle arm and handed off to the canadarm2 which maneuvered it to its position the contents will be set up in upcoming evas a malfunction in a new toilet in the destiny laboratory caused the crew to use the one in the russian segment while attempts were made to identify the fault meanwhile the shuttle was cleared for reentry nasa 15 42 43 44 20 july flight day 6 eva 2 edit astronauts wolf and marshburn began eva 2 at 15 27 utc out of the quest airlock the eva was to transfer the spare components brought by the shuttle from the icc vld to external stowage platform -3. the spares were handled by wolf riding the robotic arm to the p3 truss stowage platform where he and marshburn attached them for long term storage the purpose of the spares was to provide redundancy to the station in the period following the retirement the spares unloaded include a ku band space to ground antenna a pump module for the coolant system and a drive unit for the robotic mobile transporter a planned installation of a camera on the japanese experiment facility was postponed to a future eva for want of time meanwhile the malfunctioning toilet was set right with the replacement of internal parts and cleared for normal use after tests nasa 16 45 46 47 dave wolf performs his second space walk which is also the second of five scheduled space walks

carrier jle handoff from shuttle to station in one of the more relaxed days the japanese logistics carrier was attached to the japanese exposed facility the cargo pallet was unberthed from the shuttle by the robotic arm and handed to the robotic arm which then soft fixed it temporarily to the facility after the experiments containing an x ray astronomy payload a space environment monitor and a communications system are installed the pallet will be returned to earth by the shuttle nasa 17 48 22 july flight day 8 eva 3 edit cassidy works near the jef during space walk 3 the spacewalk involving astronauts wolf and cassidy started at 14 32 utc as part of preparation for experiment installation on the japanese external science deck cassidy removed the thermal covers off the experiment carrier meanwhile wolf removed obstructions consisting of a handrail and an equipment installation socket from the harmony node to clear the way for an upcoming japanese automated resupply ship the other task for eva 3 involving replacement of four of the six batteries in the p6 truss did not go as planned each 375 pound battery was to be removed and placed in a temporary stowage platform while a new one is taken from the icc vld and fixed the old ones will be returned to earth when two new batteries had been installed and three old ones removed the co 2 levels in suit showed an upward trend even though it never exceeded the safety limits the eva was called off with both astronauts returning into the station this left one old battery in a temporary flexible stowage position the rest of the batteries will be installed in a future eva with the rest of the evas being under replanning nasa 18 49 50 51 23 july flight day 9 edit the kibo robotic arm was inaugurated operationally with it being used to install experiments on to the japanese exposed facility the three experiments transferred from the japanese cargo pallet consisted of monitor of all sky x ray image inter orbit communication system and space environment data acquisition equipment attached payload as per the revised plan for eva 4 astronauts cassidy and marshburn will replace the remaining four batteries on p6 and complete the already deferred installation of a camera on the japanese experiment facility nasa 19 nasa 20 52 24 july flight day 10 eva 4 edit the fourth spacewalk by cassidy and marshburn involved replacement of the final four of the six batteries on p6 truss integrated electronics assembly after berthing the old batteries in the icc vld the cargo pallet was returned to the payload bay by the robotic arm the elevated levels of co 2 in suit during eva 3 was attributed to the astronaut working at a fast pace nasa 21 53 54 25 july flight day 11 edit the crew of both the shuttle and station had a day off the day was uneventful except for the american co 2 removal system shutting down without any immediate impact nasa 22 55 56 26 july flight day 12 edit the japanese exposed section cargo carrier was berthed in payload bay by the robotic arm after it was handed the pallet by the robotic arm after this the crew of both the station and the shuttle held a joint news conference meanwhile the malfunctioning american co 2 removal system has been transitioned to manual mode in order to keep it running nasa 23 57 58 27 july flight day 13 eva 5 edit marshburn and cassidy during space walk 5 cassidy and marshburn started eva 5 at 11 33 utc when they switched their suit power to internal battery for this spacewalk the co 2 absorbent system in the suits were changed from lithium hydroxide to metox due to problems with usage cassidy completed the reconfiguring of power channels in the zenith 1 patch panel which are used for the control moment gyroscopes before the rewiring two of the gyroscopes were fed by the same power channel since a failure of the channel can knock down two gyros and put the station in a degraded position the reconfiguration was made necessary this rewiring made the two gyros to operate from separate power channels meanwhile marshburn secured some multi layered insulation on the dextre later both the spacewalkers installed video cameras on the front and back of the japanese exposed facility which will be used in dockings of the japanese cargo crafts and normal operation the cameras flew up in launch configuration and now have been installed in an operational configuration thus completing the jef assembly meanwhile due to metox limitation the deployment of the pas was deferred to a future spacewalk instead some get ahead tasks were completed which included installation of handrails and a portable foot restraint nasa 24 59 60 61 62 28 july flight day 14 iss undocking edit after a crew farewell endeavour undocked from the iss at 17 26 utc unlike most other launches hatch closure which happened at 15 08 utc and undocking happened on the same day due to the extended delay in launching and the arrival of the progress 34 cargo craft after undocking hurley began a fly around of the station giving the shuttle crew an opportunity to photograph the current configuration in all directions then a final separation burn was completed at edt nasa 25 63 64 endeavour shortly after the shuttle and station post undocking separation iss shortly after the shuttle and station post undocking separation with the jef prominently seen 29 july flight day 15 edit image of orbital sunset taken from endeavour one day before the shuttle landed the obss was grappled by the robotic arm and used to inspect thermal protection system for damage from orbital debris the imagery will be analyzed to clear the shuttle for reentry nasa 26 meanwhile the foam loss on the external tank was initially attributed to substrate contamination ahead of the application of the foam 65 later during the processing of sts 128 voids in the foam was highlighted as a trigger for the shedding the air trapped in the voids could have expanded due to the high temperatures generated during ascent thus breaking the foam 66 67 30 july flight day 16 edit the crew checked out the systems for the landing and successfully deployed the dragonsat and ande 2 satellites the shuttle was cleared for reentry with the tps imagery showing no concerns nasa 27 68 69 the shuttle tracked two chances of landing at ksc on 31 july and
