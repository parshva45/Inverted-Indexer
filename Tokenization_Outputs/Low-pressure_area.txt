low pressure area wikipedia low pressure area from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search a clockwise spinning low pressure area or cyclone off southern australia the center of the spiral shaped cloud system is also the center of a low and usually is where the pressure is lowest this low pressure system over iceland spins counter clockwise due to balance between the coriolis force and the pressure gradient force weather system redirects here for a general discussion on pressure areas see pressure system a low pressure area low or depression is a region on the topographic map where the atmospheric pressure is lower than that of surrounding locations low pressure systems form under areas of wind divergence that occur in the upper levels of the troposphere the formation process of a low pressure area is known as cyclogenesis within the field of meteorology atmospheric divergence aloft occurs in two areas the first area is on the east side of upper troughs which form half of a rossby wave within the westerlies a trough with large wavelength that extends through the troposphere a second area of wind divergence aloft occurs ahead of embedded shortwave troughs which are of smaller wavelength diverging winds aloft ahead of these troughs cause atmospheric lift within the troposphere below which lowers surface pressures as upward motion partially counteracts the force of gravity thermal lows form due to localized heating caused by greater sunshine over deserts and other land masses since localized areas of warm air are less dense than their surroundings this warmer air rises which lowers atmospheric pressure near that portion of the earth s surface large scale thermal lows over continents help drive monsoon circulations low pressure areas can also form due to organized thunderstorm activity over warm water when this occurs over the tropics in concert with the intertropical convergence zone it is known as a monsoon trough monsoon troughs reach their northerly extent in august and their southerly extent in february when a convective low acquires a well hot circulation in the tropics it is termed a tropical cyclone tropical cyclones can form during any month of the year globally but can occur in either the northern or southern hemisphere during november atmospheric lift will also generally produce cloud cover through adiabatic cooling once the air becomes saturated as it rises although the low pressure area typically brings cloudy skies which act to minimize diurnal temperature extremes since clouds reflect sunlight incoming shortwave solar radiation decreases which causes lower temperatures during the day at night the absorptive effect of clouds on outgoing longwave radiation such as heat energy from the surface allows for warmer diurnal low temperatures in all seasons the stronger the area of low pressure the stronger the winds experienced in its vicinity globally low pressure systems are most frequently located over the tibetan plateau and in the lee of the rocky mountains in europe particularly in the united kingdom recurring low pressure weather systems are typically known as depressions contents 1 formation 2

development and strengthening of cyclonic circulations or low pressure areas within the atmosphere 1 cyclogenesis is the opposite of cyclolysis and has an anticyclonic high pressure system equivalent which deals with the formation of high pressure areas anticyclogenesis 2 cyclogenesis is an umbrella term for several different processes all of which result in the development of some sort of cyclone meteorologists use the term cyclone where circular pressure systems flow in the direction of the rotation 3 4 which normally coincides with areas of low pressure 5 6 the largest low pressure systems are cold core polar cyclones and extratropical cyclones which lie on the synoptic scale warm core cyclones such as tropical cyclones mesocyclones and polar lows lie within the smaller mesoscale subtropical cyclones are of intermediate size 7 8 cyclogenesis can occur at various scales from the microscale to the synoptic scale larger scale troughs also called rossby waves are synoptic in scale 9 shortwave troughs embedded within the flow around larger scale troughs are smaller in scale or mesoscale in nature 10 both rossby waves and shortwaves embedded within the flow around rossby waves migrate equatorward of the polar cyclones located in both the northern and southern hemispheres 11 all share one important aspect that of upward vertical motion within the troposphere such upward motions decrease the mass of local atmospheric columns of air which lowers surface pressure 12 extratropical cyclones form as waves along weather fronts due to a passing by shortwave aloft or upper level jet streak clarification needed before occluding later in their life cycle as cold core cyclones 13 14 15 16 polar lows are small scale short lived atmospheric low pressure systems that occur over the ocean areas poleward of the main polar front in both the northern and southern hemispheres they are part of the larger class of mesoscale weather systems polar lows can be difficult to detect using conventional weather reports and are a hazard to high latitude operations such as shipping and gas and oil platforms they are vigorous systems that have near surface winds of at least 17 metres per second 17 this depiction of the hadley cell shows the process which sustains low pressure areas diverging winds aloft allow for lower pressure and convergence at the surface which leads to upward motion tropical cyclones form due to latent heat driven by significant thunderstorm activity and are warm core with well defined circulations 18 certain criteria need to be met for their formation in most situations water temperatures of at least are needed down to a depth of at least 19 waters of this temperature cause the overlying atmosphere to be unstable enough to sustain convection and thunderstorms 20 another factor is rapid cooling with height which allows the release of the heat of condensation that powers a tropical cyclone 19 high humidity is needed especially in the lower to mid troposphere when there is a great deal of moisture in the atmosphere conditions are more favorable for disturbances to develop 19 low amounts of wind shear are needed as high shear is disruptive to the circulation 19 lastly a formative tropical cyclone needs a pre existing system of disturbed weather although without a circulation no cyclonic development will take place 19 mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land and can lead to tornado formation 21 waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear 22 in deserts lack of ground and plant moisture that would normally provide evaporative cooling can lead to intense rapid solar heating of the lower layers of air the hot air is less dense than surrounding cooler air this combined with the rising of the hot air results in a low pressure area called a thermal low 23 monsoon circulations are caused by thermal lows which form over large areas of land and their strength is driven by how land heats more quickly than the surrounding nearby ocean this generates a steady wind blowing toward the land bringing the moist near surface air over the oceans with it 24 similar rainfall is caused by the moist ocean air being lifted upwards by mountains 25 surface heating 26 convergence at the surface 27 divergence aloft or from storm produced outflows at the surface 28 however the lifting occurs the air cools due to expansion in lower pressure which in turn produces condensation in winter the land cools off quickly but the ocean keeps the heat longer due to its higher specific heat the hot air over the ocean rises creating a low pressure area and a breeze from land to ocean while a large area of drying high pressure is formed over the land increased by wintertime cooling 24 monsoons resemble sea and land breezes terms usually referring to the localized diurnal daily cycle of circulation near coastlines everywhere but they are much larger in scale also stronger and seasonal 29 climatology edit mid latitudes and subtropics edit quikscat image of typical extratropical cyclones over the ocean note the maximum winds are on the poleward side of the occluded front see also arctic oscillation extratropical cyclone and thermal low large polar cyclones help determine the steering of systems moving through the mid latitudes south of the arctic and north of the antarctic an index which is used to gauge the magnitude of this effect in the northern hemisphere is the arctic oscillation 30 extratropical cyclones tend to form east of climatological trough positions aloft near the east coast of continents or west side of oceans 31 a study of extratropical cyclones in the southern hemisphere shows that between the 30th and 70th parallels there are an average of 37 cyclones in existence during any 6 hour period 32 a separate study in the northern hemisphere suggests that approximately 234 significant extratropical cyclones form each winter 33 in europe particularly the united kingdom recurring extratropical low pressure weather systems are typically known as depressions 34 these tend to bring wet weather throughout the year thermal lows also occur over continental areas across the subtropics during the summer such as the sonoran desert the mexican plateau sahara south america and southeast asia 23 the lows are most commonly located over the tibetan plateau and in the lee of the rocky mountains 31 monsoon trough edit february position of the itcz and monsoon trough in the pacific ocean depicted by area of convergent streamlines offshore australia and in the equatorial eastern pacific see also monsoon trough elongated areas of low pressure form at the monsoon trough or intertropical convergence zone as part of the hadley cell circulation 35 monsoon troughing in the western pacific reaches its zenith in latitude during the late summer when the wintertime surface ridge in the opposite hemisphere is the strongest it can reach as far as the 40th parallel in east asia during august and 20th parallel in australia during february its poleward progression is accelerated by the onset of the summer monsoon which is characterized by the development of lower air pressure over the warmest part of the various continents 36 37 the large scale thermal lows over continents help create pressure gradients which drive monsoon circulations 38 in the southern hemisphere the monsoon trough associated with the australian monsoon reaches its most southerly latitude in february 39 oriented along a west northwest east southeast axis many of the rainforests are associated with these climatological low pressure systems 40 tropical cyclone edit infrared image of a powerful southern hemisphere cyclone winston near its initial peak intensity see also tropical cyclone tropical cyclones generally need to form more than or poleward of the 5th parallel north and 5th parallel south allowing the coriolis effect to deflect winds blowing towards the low pressure center and creating a circulation 19 worldwide tropical cyclone activity peaks in late summer when the difference between temperatures aloft and sea surface temperatures is the greatest however each particular basin has its own seasonal patterns on a worldwide scale may is the least active month while september is the most active month november is the only month that activity in all the tropical cyclone basins is possible 41 nearly one third of the tropical cyclones form within the western pacific ocean making it the most active tropical cyclone basin on earth 42 associated weather edit schematic representation of flow around a low pressure area in the northern hemisphere the pressure gradient force is represented by blue arrows the coriolis acceleration always perpendicular to the velocity by red arrows see also geostrophic wind and precipitation meteorology wind is initially accelerated from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure 43 this is due to density or temperature and moisture differences between two air masses since stronger high pressure systems contain cooler or drier air the air mass is denser and flows towards areas that are warm or moist which are in the vicinity of low pressure areas in advance of their associated cold fronts the stronger the pressure difference or pressure gradient between a high pressure system and a low pressure system the stronger the wind 44 thus stronger areas of low pressure are associated with stronger winds the coriolis force caused by the earth s rotation is what gives winds around low pressure areas such as in hurricanes cyclones and typhoons their counter clockwise anticlockwise circulation in the northern hemisphere as the wind moves inward and is deflected right from the center of high pressure and clockwise circulation in the southern hemisphere as the wind moves inward and is deflected left from the center of high pressure 45 a cyclone differs from a hurricane or typhoon only on the basis of location 46 a hurricane is a storm that occurs in the atlantic ocean and northeastern pacific ocean a typhoon occurs in the northwestern pacific ocean and a cyclone occurs in the south pacific or indian ocean 46 friction with land slows down the wind flowing into low pressure systems and causes wind to flow more inward or flowing more ageostrophically toward their centers 44 a low pressure area is commonly associated with inclement weather 47 while a high pressure area is associated with light winds and fair skies 48 tornados are often too small and of too short duration to be influenced by the coriolis force but may be so influenced when arising from a low pressure system 49 50 see also edit east asian monsoon
