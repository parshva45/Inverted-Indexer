developed across much of the caribbean sea during mid october as a lower tropospheric low interacted with a broad area of disturbed weather aided by an upper level low across the region a broad area of low pressure developed on october 13 to the southeast of jamaica and slowly became more concentrated as upper level wind shear gradually decreased dvorak classifications began on october 14 and by late october 15 the surface circulation in the system became well enough defined with sufficiently organized deep convection for the national hurricane center to designate the system as tropical depression twenty four while located about east southeast of grand cayman 1 the depression drifted southwestward because of the influence of two ridges to its north and with warm sea surface temperatures and a favorable upper level environment it strengthened into tropical storm wilma on october 17 initially development was slow due to the large size of the storm and a flat pressure gradient however convection gradually organized and from october 18 through october 19 wilma underwent explosive deepening over the open waters of the caribbean sea around on the system intensified

land it reemerged over the southern gulf of mexico on october 23 around despite wilma spending 24 hours over land it with little intensity lost and began to re intensify shortly after this was perhaps due to its large size and because the majority of its circulation remained over the warm waters of the northwest caribbean and gulf of mexico a powerful trough turned the hurricane to the northeast and accelerated its forward motion its large eye remained well organized and wilma intensified despite increasing amounts of wind shear briefly producing winds of before making landfall on cape romano

feet of water in the low lying areas and flooded homes the lower keys also experienced an unusual flood it occurred twice first as the storm approached florida it pushed water across the keys from south to north as the storm finally crossed into the everglades all the water that had been pushed by the storm was released as wilma crossed the peninsula the water then raced back across the lower keys a second time and went back out to sea this caused additional flooding and costly damage possibly due to less friction of the eyewall or moving over warm waters of the gulf stream wilma again re intensified to reach winds of and subsequently absorbed tropical storm alpha to the south before cold air and wind shear penetrated the inner core of convection on october 26 wilma transitioned into
