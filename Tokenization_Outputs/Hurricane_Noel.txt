meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the scale a tropical wave exited the coast of africa on october 16 it tracked westward initially without organization and by october 22 was interacting with a trough while approaching the lesser antilles this caused a low pressure area to develop on about east northeast of the northern lesser antilles the system continued westward with disorganized convection and was unable to develop further due to strong wind shear 1 despite the shear convection increased as barometric pressures dropped in association with the organizing system 2 turning west southwestward the low passed over the united states virgin islands on and just southeast of puerto rico the next day decreasing wind shear on allowed the thunderstorms to increase over the center late on after further organization the system developed into tropical depression sixteen at 0000 utc on about south southeast of port au prince haiti 1 initially the national hurricane center nhc forecast the depression to track west northwestward brushing southwestern haiti before moving ashore along south central cuba 3 upon becoming a tropical cyclone the wave was moving to the west northwest under the steering currents of a high pressure area over the western atlantic ocean 3 six hours after formation the center became difficult to locate 4 though subsequently the depression became much better organized a large area of convection developed over the center with several rainbands to its south 5 based on reports from hurricane hunters the national hurricane center upgraded the depression to tropical storm noel at 1815 utc on october 28 while located about 150 miles south southeast of port au prince haiti 6 after the center re developed beneath the thunderstorms the storm quickly strengthened to winds of 7 and for several hours the cyclone was drifting to the south of hispaniola noel began to lose organization as a nearby upper level low increased wind shear 8 with the circulation becoming ill defined as it further interacted with the mountainous terrain of haiti 9 the storm crossed western haiti as a

30 tropical storm noel made landfall near gibara cuba with winds of about 12 13 the center of noel remained well organized as it tracked through eastern cuba though its sustained winds quickly diminished to minimal tropical storm force 14 early on october 31 it began drifting to the north northwest in response to the approach of a short wave trough from the west and the eastward shift of the mid level ridge 15 a large area of strong convective rainbands persisted to its east though due to increased upper level wind shear there was little convection near the center 16 shortly after on october 31 noel emerged off the north coast of cuba 17 and subsequently the cyclone became better organized as the circulation became better associated with the convection 18 while located just off the north coast of cuba the motion of noel was nearly stationary though forecasters indicated it could have executed a small cyclonic loop 19 on october 31 the canadian hurricane centre began tracking the storm 20 hurricane noel undergoing extratropical transition on november 2 convection increased early on november 1 though initially the center remained to the southwest of the large area of thunderstorms 21 at that day the storm passed over the bahamian island of new providence near the city of nassau 22 later that day the center tracked beneath the convection 23 and noel accelerated northeastward in the southwesterly flow ahead of an approaching trough as it did so the center became elongated and distorted 24 the cyclone maintained a large round area of deep convection with well defined outflow and an eye feature became evident on satellite imagery based on reports from hurricane hunters the national hurricane center upgraded noel to hurricane status early on november 2 about 180 miles north northeast of nassau bahamas 25 its convection began to wane as it moved through progressively cooler waters and as it lost tropical characteristics its wind field expanded 26 by late

extratropical 31 the extratropical low continued to the northeast and made landfall over southwest greenland on the afternoon of november 5 bringing tropical storm force winds to the area the center dissipated over greenland later that night while its lowest barometric pressure as a tropical system was 980 mb on november 4 while located near labrador it registered a minimum pressure of 966 mb 32
