temperatures of 2 tracking through a highly baroclinic environment 3 the storm became better organized and at on october 5 klaus attained hurricane status about east of antigua shortly thereafter it passed east of barbuda its closest point of approach to the lesser antilles klaus reached peak winds of and a minimum central pressure of though most of its deep convection and strong winds remained
