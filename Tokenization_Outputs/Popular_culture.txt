was associated with poor education and the lower classes 9 as opposed to the official culture and higher education of the upper classes 10 11 the stress in the distinction from official culture became more pronounced towards the end of the 19th century 12 need quotation to verify a usage that became established by the interbellum period 13 need quotation to verify from the end of world war ii following major cultural and social changes brought by mass media innovations the meaning of popular culture began to overlap with those of mass culture media culture image culture consumer culture and culture for mass consumption 14 social and cultural changes in the united states were a pioneer in this with respect to other western countries the abbreviated form pop for popular as in pop music dates from the late 1950s 15 although terms pop and popular are in some cases used interchangeably and their meaning partially overlap the term pop is narrower pop is specific of something containing qualities of mass appeal while popular refers to what has gained popularity regardless of its style 16 17 according to author john storey there are six definitions of popular culture 18 the quantitative definition of culture has the problem that much high culture e g television dramatizations of jane austen is also popular pop culture is also defined as the culture that is left over when we have decided what high culture is however many works straddle the boundaries e g william shakespeare and charles dickens a third definition equates pop culture with mass culture and ideas this is seen as a commercial culture mass produced for mass consumption by mass media 19 from a western european perspective this may be compared to american culture clarification needed alternatively pop culture can be defined as an authentic culture of the people but this can be problematic as there are many ways of defining the people storey argued that there is a political dimension to popular culture neo gramscian hegemony theory sees popular culture as a site of struggle between the resistance of subordinate groups in society and the forces of incorporation operating in the interests of dominant groups in society a postmodernist approach to popular culture would no longer recognize the distinction between high and popular culture storey claims that popular culture emerged from the urbanization of the industrial revolution studies of shakespeare by weimann barber or bristol for example locate much of the characteristic vitality of his drama in its participation in renaissance popular culture while contemporary practitioners like dario fo and john mcgrath use popular culture in its gramscian sense that includes ancient folk traditions the commedia for example 20 21 need quotation to verify popular culture is constantly evolving and occurs uniquely in place and time it forms currents and eddies and represents a complex of mutually interdependent perspectives and values that influence society and its institutions in various ways for example certain currents of pop culture may originate from or diverge into a subculture representing perspectives with which the mainstream popular culture has only limited familiarity items of popular culture most typically appeal to a broad spectrum of the public important contemporary contributions for understanding what popular culture means have been given by the german researcher ronald daus who studies the impact of extra european cultures in north america asia and especially in latin america folklore edit adaptations based on traditional folklore provide a source of popular culture 22 this early layer of cultural mainstream still persists today in a form separate from mass produced popular culture propagating by word of mouth rather than via mass media e g in the form of jokes or urban legend with the widespread use of the internet from the 1990s the distinction between mass media and word of mouth has become blurred although the folkloric element of popular culture engages heavily with the commercial element the public has its own tastes and it may not always embrace every cultural or subculture item sold moreover beliefs and opinions about the products of commercial culture spread by word of mouth and become modified in the process in the same manner that folklore evolves
