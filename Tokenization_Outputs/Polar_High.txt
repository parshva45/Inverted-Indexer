polar high wikipedia polar high from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the polar highs are areas of high atmospheric pressure around the north and south poles the north polar high being the stronger one because land gains and loses heat more effectively than sea the cold temperatures in the polar regions cause air to descend to create the high pressure a process called subsidence just as the warm temperatures around the equator cause air to rise to create the low pressure intertropical convergence zone rising air also occurs along bands of low pressure situated just below the polar highs around the 50th parallels of latitude these extratropical convergence zones are occupied by the polar fronts where air masses of polar origin meet and clash with those of tropical or subtropical origin 1 this convergence of rising air completes the vertical cycle around the polar cell in each latitudinal hemisphere closely related to this concept is the polar vortex surface temperatures under the polar highs are the coldest on earth with no month having an average temperature above freezing regions under the polar high also experience very low levels of precipitation which leads them to be known as polar deserts air flows outwards from the poles to create the polar easterlies in the arctic and antarctic areas references edit yochanan kushnir 2000 the climate system general circulation and climate zones retrieved 13 march 2012 v t e cyclones and anticyclones of the world centers of action types extratropical mesocyclone anticyclonic storm polar subtropical cyclone subtropical ridge thermal tropical anticyclones polar high siberian high azores high bermuda north atlantic north american high canadian greenland south atlantic high st helena north pacific high hawaii high south pacific high kalahari high cyclones aleutian low alaska far east russia atlantic hurricane australian low east coast european windstorm genoa low icelandic low kona storm hawaii mediterranean tropical like cyclone pacific hurricane polar vortex typhoon wake low climatology retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title polar high oldid 781968903 categories climatology navigation menu personal tools not logged in talk contributions create account log in namespaces article talk variants views read edit view history more search navigation main page contents featured content current events random article donate to wikipedia wikipedia store interaction help about wikipedia community portal recent changes contact page tools what links here related changes upload file special pages permanent link page information wikidata item cite this page print export create a book download as pdf printable version languages norsk nynorsk edit links this page was last edited on 24 may 2017 at 06 59 text is available under the creative commons attribution sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
