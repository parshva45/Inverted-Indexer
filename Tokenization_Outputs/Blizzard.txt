severe snow storm characterized by strong winds causing blowing snow that results in low visibilities the difference between a blizzard and a snowstorm is the strength of the wind not the amount of snow to be a blizzard a snow storm must have sustained winds or frequent gusts that are greater than or equal to with blowing or drifting snow which reduces visibility to or or less and must last for a prolonged period of three hours or more 1 2 while severe cold and large amounts of drifting snow may accompany blizzards they are not required blizzards can bring whiteout conditions and can paralyze regions for days at a time particularly where snowfall is unusual or rare a severe blizzard has winds over near zero visibility and temperatures of or lower 3 in antarctica blizzards are associated with winds spilling over the edge of the ice plateau at an average velocity of 3 ground blizzard refers to a weather condition where loose snow or ice on the ground is lifted and blown by strong winds the primary difference between a ground blizzard as opposed to a regular blizzard is that in a ground blizzard no precipitation is produced at the time but rather all the precipitation is

dakota 1966 in the united states storm systems powerful enough to cause blizzards usually form when the jet stream dips far to the south allowing cold dry polar air from the north to clash with warm humid air moving up from the south 2 6 they are most common in the great plains the great lakes states and the northeastern states along the coast and less common in the pacific northwest when cold moist air from the pacific ocean moves eastward to the rocky mountains and the great plains and warmer moist air moves north from the gulf of mexico all that is needed is a movement of cold polar air moving south to form potential blizzard conditions that may extend from the texas panhandle to the great lakes another storm system occurs when a cold core low over the hudson bay area in canada is displaced southward over southeastern canada the great lakes and new england when the rapidly moving cold front collides with warmer air coming north from the gulf of mexico strong surface winds significant cold air advection and extensive wintry precipitation occur conditions approaching a blizzard whiteout in minnesota on march 1 2007 note the unclear horizon near the center low pressure systems moving out of the rocky mountains onto the great plains a broad expanse of flat land much of it covered in prairie steppe and grassland can cause thunderstorms and rain to the south and heavy snows and strong winds to the north with few trees or other obstructions to reduce wind and blowing this part of the country is particularly vulnerable to blizzards with very low temperatures and

can form in the north atlantic ocean and some of which form as far south as the gulf of mexico the term is most often used in the coastal areas of new england and atlantic canada this type of storm has characteristics similar to a hurricane more specifically it describes a low pressure area whose center of rotation is just off the east coast and whose leading winds in the left forward quadrant rotate onto land from the northeast high storm waves may sink ships at sea and cause coastal flooding and beach erosion notable include the great blizzard of 1888 one of the worst blizzards in u s
