microburst wikipedia microburst from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search for the networking phenomenon see micro bursting networking illustration of a microburst the air moves in a downward motion until it hits ground level it then spreads outward in all directions the wind regime in a microburst is opposite to that of a tornado tree damage from a downburst a microburst is a small downdraft that moves in a way opposite to a tornado microbursts are found in strong thunderstorms 1 there are two types of microbursts within a thunderstorm wet microbursts and dry microbursts they go through three stages in their cycle the downburst outburst and cushion stages a microburst can be particularly dangerous to aircraft especially during landing due to the wind shear caused by its gust front several fatal and historic crashes have been attributed to the phenomenon over the past several decades and flight crew training goes to great lengths on how to properly recover from a microburst wind shear event a microburst often has high winds that can knock over fully grown trees they usually last from a couple of seconds to several minutes contents 1 history of term 1.1 dry microbursts 1.2 wet microbursts 2 development stages of microbursts 3 physical processes of dry and wet microbursts 3.1 basic physical processes using simplified buoyancy equations 3.2 negative vertical motion associated only with buoyancy 4 danger to aircraft 5 danger to buildings 6 see also 7 references 8 external links history of term edit the term was defined by mesoscale meteorology expert ted fujita as affecting an area in diameter or less distinguishing them as a type of downburst and apart from common wind shear which can encompass greater areas 2 fujita also coined the term macroburst for downbursts larger than 3 a distinction can be made between a wet microburst which consists of precipitation and a dry microburst which typically consists of virga 4 they generally are formed by precipitation cooled air rushing to the surface but they perhaps also could be powered from the high speed winds of the jet stream deflected toward the surface by a thunderstorm or by dynamical processes see rear flank downdraft microbursts are recognized as capable of generating wind speeds higher than 75 m s 170 mph 270 km h microbursts have also been called air bombs 5 dry microbursts edit dry microburst schematic when rain falls below the cloud base or is mixed with dry air it begins to evaporate and this evaporation process cools the air the cool air descends and accelerates as it approaches the ground when the cool air approaches the ground it spreads out in all directions and this divergence of the wind is the signature of the microburst high winds spread out in this type of pattern showing little or no curvature are known as straight line winds 6 dry microbursts produced by high based thunderstorms that generate little to no surface rainfall occur in environments characterized by a thermodynamic profile exhibiting an inverted v at thermal and moisture profile as viewed on a skew t log p thermodynamic diagram wakimoto 1985 developed a conceptual model over the high plains of the united states of a dry microburst environment that comprised three important variables mid level moisture a deep and dry adiabatic lapse rate in the sub cloud layer and low surface relative humidity wet microbursts edit wet microburst schematic wet microbursts are downbursts accompanied by significant precipitation at the surface which are warmer dubious discuss than their environment wakimoto 1998 7 these downbursts rely more on the drag of precipitation for downward acceleration of parcels than negative buoyancy which tend to drive dry microbursts as a result higher mixing ratios are necessary for these downbursts to form hence the name wet microbursts melting of ice particularly hail appears to play an important role in downburst formation wakimoto and bringi 1988 especially in the lowest above ground level proctor 1989 these factors among others make forecasting wet microbursts difficult characteristic dry microburst wet microburst location of highest probability within the united states midwest west southeast precipitation little or none moderate or heavy cloud bases as high as 500 mb hpa as high as 850 mb hpa features below cloud base virga precipitation shaft primary catalyst evaporative cooling downward transport of higher momentum environment below cloud base deep dry layer low relative humidity dry adiabatic lapse rate shallow dry layer high relative humidity moist adiabatic lapse rate surface outflow pattern omni directional gusts of the direction of the mid level wind development stages of microbursts edit the evolution of downbursts is broken down into three stages the contact stage the outburst stage and the cushion stage a downburst initially develops as the downdraft begins its descent from the cloud base the downdraft accelerates and within minutes reaches the ground contact stage it is during the contact stage the highest winds are observed during the outburst stage the wind curls as the cold air of the downburst moves away from the point of impact with the ground during the cushion stage winds about the curl continue to accelerate while the winds at the surface slow due to friction 8 when the two plates hit each other it forms a tornado and is very dangerous for a aircraft to land in this situation physical processes of dry and wet microbursts edit this article needs attention from an expert in meteorology please add a reason or a talk parameter to this template to explain the issue with the article wikiproject meteorology may be able to help recruit an expert february 2009 basic physical processes using simplified buoyancy equations edit start by using the vertical momentum equation d w d t 1 p z g by decomposing the variables into a basic state and a perturbation defining the basic states and using the ideal gas law p r t v then the equation can be written in the form b g g t v t v t v where b is buoyancy the virtual temperature correction usually is rather small and to a good approximation it can be ignored when computing buoyancy finally the effects of precipitation loading on the vertical motion are parametrized by including a term that decreases buoyancy as the liquid water mixing ratio increases leading to the final form of the momentum equation d w d t 1 p z b g the first term is the effect of perturbation pressure gradients on vertical motion in some storms this term has a large effect on updrafts rotunno and klemp 1982 but there is not much reason to believe it has much of an impact on downdrafts at least to a first approximation and therefore will be ignored the second term is the effect of buoyancy on vertical motion clearly in the case of microbursts one expects to find that b is negative meaning the parcel is cooler than its environment this cooling typically takes place as a result of phase changes evaporation melting and sublimation precipitation particles that are small but are in great quantity promote a maximum contribution to cooling and hence to creation of negative buoyancy the major contribution to this process is from evaporation the last term is the effect of water loading whereas evaporation is promoted by large numbers of small droplets it only requires a few large drops to contribute substantially to the downward acceleration of air parcels this term is associated with storms having high precipitation rates comparing the effects of water loading to those associated with buoyancy if a parcel has a liquid water mixing ratio of 1.0 g kg this is roughly equivalent to about 0.3 k of negative buoyancy the latter is a large but not extreme value therefore in general terms negative buoyancy is typically the major contributor to downdrafts 9 negative vertical motion associated only with buoyancy edit using pure parcel theory results in a prediction of the maximum downdraft of w m a x 2 nape where nape is the negative available potential energy nape s f c l f s b d z and where lfs denotes the level of free sink for a descending parcel and sfc denotes the surface this means that the maximum downward motion is associated with the integrated negative buoyancy even a relatively modest negative buoyancy can result in a substantial downdraft if it is maintained over a relatively large depth a downward speed of results from the relatively modest nape value of 312.5 m 2 s to a first approximation the maximum gust is roughly equal to the maximum downdraft speed 9 danger to aircraft edit further information downburst wind shear and cumulonimbus and aviation a photograph of the surface curl soon after a microburst impacted the surface the scale and suddenness of a microburst makes it a notorious danger to aircraft particularly those at low altitude which are taking off or landing the following are some fatal crashes and or aircraft incidents that have been attributed to microbursts in the vicinity of airports a 1956 kano airport boac argonaut crash boac canadair c 4

aircraft to crash when they are attempting to land the above mentioned boac and pan am flights are notable exceptions the microburst is an extremely powerful gust of air that once hitting the ground spreads in all directions as the aircraft is coming in to land the pilots try to slow the plane to an appropriate speed when the microburst hits the pilots will see a large spike in their airspeed caused by the force of the headwind created by the microburst a pilot inexperienced with microbursts would try to decrease the speed the plane would then travel through the microburst and fly into the tailwind causing a sudden decrease in the amount of air flowing across the wings the decrease in airflow over the wings of the aircraft causes a drop in the amount of lift produced this decrease in lift combined with a strong downward flow of air can cause the thrust required to remain at altitude to exceed what is available thus causing the aircraft to stall 10 if the plane is at a low altitude shortly after takeoff or during landing it will not have sufficient altitude to recover the strongest microburst recorded thus far occurred at andrews field maryland on august 1st 1983 with wind speeds reaching 240.5 km h 149.5 mi h 12 danger to buildings edit strong microburst winds flip a several ton shipping container up the side of a hill vaughan ontario canada on august 9 2016 a wet
