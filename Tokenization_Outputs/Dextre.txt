dextre wikipedia dextre from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search this article is about the space robot for dexter see dexter disambiguation dextre many of the robotic arms and experiments can be operated from earth performing tasks while the crew sleeps dextre on the end of canadarm2 dextre as photographed by an expedition 26 crew member dextre as photographed by an expedition 27 crew member dextre also known as the special purpose dexterous manipulator spdm is a two armed robot or telemanipulator which is part of the mobile servicing system on the international space station iss and does repairs otherwise requiring spacewalks it was launched march 11 2008 on mission sts 123 dextre is part of canada s contribution to the iss and is named to represent its dexterous nature dextre is the third canadian robotic arm used on the iss preceded by the space canadarm and the large canadarm2 dextre was designed and manufactured by macdonald dettwiler mda 1 in the early morning of february 4 2011 dextre completed its first official assignment which consists of unpacking two pieces for kounotori 2 while the on board crew was sleeping 2 contents 1 structure 2 tools 3 design and delivery 4 installation 5 purpose 6 operation use 7 additional usage 8 see also 9 references 10 external links structure edit dextre resembles a gigantic torso fitted with two extremely agile 3.5 metres arms total mass approx 3,664 pounds 3 the 3.5 metre long body 3 pivots at the waist the body has a power data grapple fixture at the head end that can be grasped by the larger space station arm canadarm2 so that dextre can be positioned at the various orbital replacement unit oru worksites around the space station the other end of the body has a latching end effector virtually identical to that of canadarm2 so that dextre can also be attached to space station grapple fixtures or the mobile base system dextre can also be operated whilst it is attached to the end of canadarm2 4 each arm is somewhat like a shortened canadarm2 in that it has 7 joints but is fixed to dextre at one end at the end of arms are oru tool changeout mechanisms otcm the otcm has built in grasping jaws a retractable socket drive a monochrome tv camera lights and an umbilical connector that can provide power data and video to from a payload 5 dextre moves one arm at a time while one arm may hold onto the station using specially provided standard h or micro interfaces 6 5.1 for stability and ease of control 6 2.1 the other is available to perform tasks tools edit the lower body of dextre has a pair of orientable colour tv cameras with lights a platform for stowing orus and a tool holster the tool holster is equipped with two robotic micro conical tools rmcts which allow an arm to grasp additional types of oru fixtures the socket extension tool set extends the length of the grasping socket on an arm and the robotic off set tool rost allows an arm to grasp difficult to reach targets 7 several new tools were added as part of the 2011 robotic refueling mission a wire cutter safety cap removal tool evr nozzle tool and a multifunction tool with several adapters in 2013 the h ii transport vehicle brought the robotic on orbit transfer cage rotc which is a sliding table within the japanese airlock platform from which to retrieve and subsequently install new hardware 8 robotic refueling mission phase 2 will use the visual inspection poseable invertebrate robot vipir borescope camera with a 34 inch long flexible tube 9 sarah self adaptive robotic auxiliary hand is a three fingered hand that is designed to attach to the end of arm it has not been delivered to the iss 6 design and delivery edit dextre was designed and manufactured by mda space missions as part of the 200 million contracted by the canadian space agency which will oversee its future operations and the necessary training of station crews 10 it completed all necessary testing and was delivered to the kennedy space center ksc in florida in mid june 2007 once at ksc it underwent flight verification testing followed by shuttle integration installation edit dextre was launched to the iss on march 11 2008 aboard endeavour on mission sts 123 it woke up and activated heaters needed for keeping its joints and electronics warm after receiving power from the space canadarm2 on march 14 during the second spacewalk on march 16 spacewalking astronauts attached the two 3.35 metres arms to the main body and further prepared the machine for its handyman job on the station after the spacewalk crew members hooked dextre back up to the robotic arm to keep it warm and to allow nasa to perform tests to ensure all of electronics were working properly later that day the crew tested all of its joints and brakes 11 astronauts finished outfitting the robot during a third spacewalk on march 17 2008 12 purpose edit dextre is designed to handle orbital replacement units many spares are stored on the iss and dextre is able to carry them to and from worksites and install replacements when failures occur before dextre arrived astronauts were required to perform space walks to carry out this work operation use edit after testing and trials the first use planned in the removal and replacement of the rpcm remote power control module in 2009 4 additional usage edit in early august 2004 nasa declared its intention to use dextre or a close copy of it as the robotic component for the hubble space telescope rescue mission months after awarding a contract to mda space missions to provide an spdm copy for the hubble repair mission 13 nasa then canceled the mission in favour of flying a shuttle mission to perform the repairs upgrades nasa cited excessive risks and new found confidence in the space shuttle external tank as reasons for the cancellation dextre was the subject of an april day joke article on april 1 2008 on apod website 14 dextre was also featured in the new $5 canadian polymer bank note together with canadarm2 which commander chris hadfield helped reveal aboard the international space station 15 see also edit robotics portal space portal canadarm which was used on
