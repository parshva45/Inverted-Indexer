uzlovoy module wikipedia uzlovoy module from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search mockup of the uzlovoy module at the yuri gagarin cosmonaut training center uzlovoy module also known as um russian nodal module berth 1 is a russian spacecraft which will form part of the international space station and later the proposed russian opsek space station approved in 2011 and scheduled for launch in 2018 it is designed to connect modules of the future opsek space station contents 1 design 1.1 uzlovoy module 2 international space station 3 launch 4 see also 5 references 6 external links 6.1 space agency websites 6.2 images design edit a view of the interior of the docking node of the russian space station core module showing the hatches leading to the various modules and the cables and hoses trailing through them the nodal module is intended to serve as the only permanent element of opsek a russian space station intended to support deep space manned exploration missions to mars possibly the moon and saturn other opsek modules will be replaced as they reach the end of their useful life whilst the uzlovoy module will be refurbished on orbit for an extended period the module has six hybrid docking ports one port is equipped with an active docking port to allow docking with the space station while the remaining five ports are passive enabling other spacecraft to dock with the module the nadir or earth facing port will support automated transfer of propellants between docked russian spacecraft and the ros in both directions and automated docking of manned and unmanned spacecraft using the kurs system the docking compartment has an internal volume of 14 cubic metres citation needed in the current plans the zvezda nadir location is scheduled to be used by the nauka module additionally the so2 was put back in the plans but relocated to zvezda zenith location the location for the cancelled spp 2 uzlovoy module edit in the mid 2000s rkk energia the manufacturer of the ros components again added the um to the future configuration of the iss the proposal is to execute a similar to the original iss plan with the addition of a nodal module significant modification of the udm design to increase the number of docking ports from 4 to 6 and to take into account its location at mlm nadir at the same time with reducing its weight from 20t to 4t and removing the additional life support system 3 and two additional science energy modules to the segment around 2013-2015 4 5 despite its small size this four ton ball shaped module could play an extremely important role in the russian space program 2 the preliminary design was completed on jan 15 2011 when rkk energia announced that its scientific and technical council nts conducted a meeting which reviewed and approved the preliminary design of the nodal module and associated hardware the meeting also approved the specialized launch craft a progress cargo ship designated the progress m um and the adaptation of the soyuz rocket for the launch of the progress m um spacecraft module 6 2 international space station edit opsek is intended to be partially constructed in orbit whilst attached to the iss equipped with six docking ports the uzlovoy module is planned to remain in orbit whilst all other modules come and go as their life span and mission required 2 6 the ball shaped nodal module will support the docking of two scientific and power modules during the final stage of iss assembly and provide the russian orbital segment ros additional docking ports to receive soyuz and progress spacecraft as well as additional modules launch edit annotated image of the russian orbital segment configuration as of 2011 prior to the launch of nauka and the nm um was expected to be incorporated into the iss in 2018 2 it will be launched along with the progress m um spacecraft a modified progress spacecraft which will be used to deliver it to the space station a soyuz 2 1b carrier rocket will be used to place it into orbit uzlovoy module will be docked to the nadir or earth facing port of the nauka module however launch of nauka was delayed to early 2018 7 as of august 2017 update launch is planned for the fourth quarter of 2018 7 see also edit universal docking module spaceflight portal space portal orbital piloted assembly and experiment complex proposed
