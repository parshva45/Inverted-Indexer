atmosphere unit wikipedia atmosphere unit from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search atmosphere pressure symbol atm unit conversions 1 atm in is equal to si units u s customary units the standard atmosphere symbol atm is a unit of pressure defined as 101 325 pa 1.013 25 bar it is sometimes used as a reference or standard pressure contents 1 history 2 pressure units and equivalencies 3 other applications 4 see also 5 references history edit in 1954 the 10th des poids et mesures cgpm adopted standard atmosphere for general use and affirmed its definition of being precisely equal to 1,013,250 dynes per square centimetre 101325 pa 1 this value was intended to represent the mean atmospheric pressure at mean sea level at the latitude of paris france citation needed and does reflect the mean sea level pressure for many industrialized nations that are at broadly similar latitudes in chemistry and in various industries the reference pressure referred to in standard temperature and pressure stp was commonly but standards have since diverged in 1982 the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac recommended that for the purposes of specifying the physical properties of substances standard pressure should be precisely 100 kpa 1 bar 2 pressure units and equivalencies edit pressure units v t e pascal bar technical atmosphere standard

ambient pressure compared to vacuum of the system being calculated or measured 3 for example for underwater pressures a pressure of 3.1 ata would mean that the 1 atm of the air above water is included in this value and the pressure due to water would total 2.1 atm notes torr and mm hg are often taken to be identical for most practical purposes to 5 significant digits they are interchangeable a b c this is the customarily accepted value for 2 o 4 it is precisely the product of per square centimeter one technical atmosphere times bar atmosphere divided by one gram force it is not accepted practice to define the value for water column based on a true physical realization of water which would be of this value because the true maximum density of vienna standard mean ocean water is kg l at 3.984 also this would still ignore the 2 o reduction that would actually occur in a true physical realization due to the vapor pressure over water at 3.984 a b nist value of g ml assumed for the density of hg at 0 other applications edit scuba divers and others use the word atmosphere and atm in relation to pressures that are relative to mean atmospheric pressure at sea level 1.013 bar
