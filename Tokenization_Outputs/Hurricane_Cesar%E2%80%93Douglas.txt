the few tropical cyclones to survive the crossover from the atlantic to east pacific basin and was the last to receive two names upon doing so cesar was the third named storm and second hurricane of the 1996 atlantic hurricane season the system formed in the southern caribbean sea and affected several countries in south america before crossing nicaragua and entering the eastern pacific where it was renamed douglas the storm killed 113 people in central and south america and left 29 others missing mainly due to flooding and mudslides contents 1 meteorological history 2 preparations 3 impact

and intensity of the storm according to the scale the origins of hurricane cesar were from a tropical wave and an elongated area of low pressure that emerged into the atlantic from the west coast of africa on for several days the wave moved westward without any organization although an anticyclone aloft provided conditions favorable for development on convection or thunderstorms increased along the wave as it approached the southern windward islands surface pressure steadily dropped as the system moved through the lesser antilles and a circulation began developing near trinidad and tobago based on surface and satellite data it is estimated the system developed into tropical depression three at 1800 utc on near isla margarita off the north coast of venezuela 1 operationally the national hurricane center nhc did not consider it as a tropical depression until later 1 2 with an unusually strong high pressure area located over the bahamas the tropical depression moved westward through the southern caribbean near the northern coast of south america around on it struck the island of which reported sustained winds of the observation indicated the depression attained tropical storm status 1 although operationally the depression upgraded until the next day at which point the nhc named the storm cesar 2 after crossing the storm moved near or over guajira peninsula in extreme northern colombia its proximity to south america prevented significant strengthening until late on when the storm reached the open waters of the southwest caribbean sea 1 cesar making landfall in nicaragua on cesar attained hurricane status about halfway between nicaragua and colombia later that day the hurricane passed over san island which is part of a small colombian archipelago off the east coast of nicaragua as cesar approached central america a eye formed surrounded by deep convection in the form of an eyewall at about on hurricane cesar made landfall just north of bluefields nicaragua with winds of it moved quickly west northward through the country weakening to tropical storm status and emerging into the eastern pacific ocean by 1 this made cesar the most recent tropical cyclone to traverse from the atlantic to east pacific basin until otto achieved the same feat in 2016 3 in addition following the dissipation of there was a policy change which determined that future storms would retain their original name upon crossing into another basin 4 upon reaching the pacific the system was renamed tropical depression seven e 5 but in a post analysis it was determined the cyclone maintained tropical storm status while crossing central america 1 once its status as a tropical storm was confirmed it was renamed tropical storm douglas at the time the agreement through the world meteorological organization was for storms to be renamed if they cross from the atlantic to the pacific 6 as the storm moved westward it quickly intensified with an eye like feature developing by on 7 shortly thereafter douglas attained hurricane status about southwest of the guatemala mexico border 6 around that time tropical cyclone prediction models anticipated two scenarios for the future of douglas one was a northwest track to make landfall near acapulco and the other was a continued west northwest track while remaining offshore 8 hurricane douglas ultimately took the latter track 6 by late on the eye of the hurricane was well defined on mexican radar and with favorable upper level outflow warm sea surface temperatures and a climatologically favorable region for intense hurricanes the nhc forecast douglas to strengthen to winds of 9 the next day its structure became atypical of a strengthening hurricane and the eye was briefly not seen on satellite imagery 10 on douglas became much better organized as it turned more west northwestward 11 and it attained major hurricane status or a on the scale about southwest of manzanillo by early on douglas reached peak winds of a on the scale later that day the hurricane attained its lowest pressure of 946 mbar about south of the southern tip of the baja california peninsula douglas maintained peak intensity for 6 until when the eye became less organized as the overall convection began to weaken 12 weakening continued due to cooler waters as douglas turned to the west and on the hurricane deteriorated to tropical storm status 6 as a tropical storm there was minimal deep convection although the center remained very well defined 13 on douglas weakened to tropical depression status and by the next day could no longer be classified as a tropical cyclone the remnant circulation continued westward for several days 6 preparations edit prior to arrival in venezuela a tropical storm warning was issued for areas west of la vela de coro to the border with colombia the warning was discontinued later that day 1 the government of colombia issued a tropical storm warning on from the border with venezuela to barranquilla as well as the islands of aruba and these warnings were discontinued later that day after the passage 1 as cesar approached central america hurricane warnings were posted in nicaragua 31 hours before landfall leaving ample time to prepare for the hurricane with hurricane joan occurring only 8 years prior 10,724 people were evacuated before and during the hurricane to take refuge at special camps 14 on shortly after cesar emerged into the pacific ocean and was reclassified tropical depression seven e the government of mexico issued a tropical storm watch from puerto madero to acapulco 5 about later after the depression intensified into tropical storm douglas the mexican government canceled the watch and issued a new tropical storm warning from salina cruz to acapulco this was due to the large extent of tropical storm force winds associated with douglas and its proximity to the south coast of mexico another tropical storm watch was briefly issued on from acapulco to
