intense hurricane to make landfall in the united states on record 1 and the most intense atlantic hurricane until hurricane gilbert the second tropical cyclone second hurricane and second major hurricane of the 1935 atlantic hurricane season the labor day hurricane was the first of three hurricanes to strike the united states at that intensity during the 20th century the other two being 1969 s hurricane camille and 1992 s hurricane andrew after forming as a weak tropical storm east of the bahamas on august 29 it slowly proceeded westward and became a hurricane on september 1 on long key it struck about midway through the calm the waters quickly receded after carving new channels connecting the bay with the ocean however gale force winds and high seas persisted into tuesday preventing rescue efforts the storm continued northwest along the florida west coast weakening before its second landfall near cedar key florida on september 4 the compact and intense hurricane caused extreme damage in the upper florida keys as a storm surge of approximately 18 to meters swept over the low lying islands the strong winds and the surge destroyed nearly all the structures between tavernier and marathon the town of islamorada was obliterated portions of the key west extension of the florida east coast railway were severely damaged or destroyed the hurricane also caused additional damage

of the storm according to the scale first indications of conditions favorable to the origin of this disturbance were noted during the last 2 or 3 days of august to the eastward and northward of turks islands but it was not until august 31 that a definite depression appeared near long island in the southeastern bahamas and deepened rapidly as it moved westward hurricane intensity was doubtless reached by the developing disturbance near the south end of andros island on september 2 broad recurve brought it to the florida keys late on september 2 by that time it was of small diameter but of tremendous force there was a calm of forty minutes on lower matecumbe key and about fifty five minutes at the long key fishing camp 9 20 to 10 15 p m the rate of progress of the hurricane was about ten miles an hour and the calm center must have been nine to ten miles in diameter after leaving the keys the storm skirted the florida gulf coast on a broad recurve passed inland at cedar keys and finally left the continent near cape 3 heavy rainfall spread in advance and magnified to the left of the track across the mid atlantic states rainfall totals of 16.7 inches in easton maryland and 13.4 inches at atlantic city new jersey were the highest seen with the storm 4 the storm continued into north atlantic ocean where off southern greenland it was lost on september 10 by merging with a cyclone of extratropical 2 the first recorded instance of an aircraft flown for the specific purpose of locating a hurricane occurred on the afternoon of september 2 the weather 1 30 pm advisory 5 placed the center of the hurricane at north latitude west longitude moving slowly westward this was about 27 miles north of isabela de sagua villa clara cuba and 145 miles east of havana captain leonard povey of the cuban army air corps volunteered to investigate the threat to the capital flying a curtis hawk ii captain povey an american expatriate who was the chief training officer observed the storm north of its reported position but flying an open cockpit biplane opted not to fly into it 6 7 8 he later proposed an aerial hurricane patrol 9 nothing further came of this idea until june 1943 when colonel joe duckworth and lieutenant ralph flew into a hurricane near galveston texas 10 records edit the labor day hurricane was the most intense storm ever known to have struck the united states and any land areas in the western hemisphere having the lowest sea level pressure ever recorded in the united central pressure of 892 mbar 26.35 an intensity of between 162 kn and 164 kn the somewhat compensating effects of a slow 7 kn translational velocity along with an extremely tiny radius of maximum wind 5 nmi 9.3 miles led to an analyzed intensity at landfall of 160 kt category 5 this is the highest intensity for a u s landfalling hurricane in hurdat2 as hurricane camille has been recently reanalyzed to have the second highest landfalling intensity with 150 kn 11 records of the lowest pressure were secured from three aneroid barometers the values ranging from 26.75 to 26.98 inches however none of these barometers had previously been compared to standard one of the barometers owned by ivar olson was shipped to the weather bureau in washington where it was tested in the instrument division careful laboratory tests showed it to be an exceptionally responsive and reliable instrument and that the correct reading at the position of the needle indicated by mr olson at the center of the storm was 26.35 inches this is the lowest record of pressure at a land station

preparations edit northeast storm warnings 15 were ordered displayed from fort pierce to fort myers in the september 1 9 30 am weather bureau advisory 16 upon receipt of this advisory the u s coast guard station miami fl sent a plane along the coast to advise boaters and campers of the impending danger by dropping message blocks a second flight was made sunday afternoon all planes were placed in the hangar and its door closed at 10 00 am monday morning 17 18 the 3 30 am advisory september 2 labor day predicted the disturbance will probably pass through the florida straits monday and cautioned against high tides and gales florida keys and ships in path 19 the 1 30 pm advisory ordered hurricane warnings 15 for the key west district 16 which extended north to key largo 20 at around 2 00 pm fred ghent assistant administrator florida emergency relief administration requested a special train to evacuate the veterans work camps located in the upper keys 21 it departed miami at 4 25 pm delayed by a draw bridge opening obstructions across the track poor visibility and the necessity to back the locomotive below homestead so it could head out on the return trip 22 the train finally arrived at the islamorada station on upper matecumbe key at about 8 20 pm this coincided with an abrupt wind shift from northeast florida bay to southeast atlantic ocean and the arrival on the coast of the storm surge 2 impact edit three ships ran afoul of the storm the danish motorship leise maersk was carried over alligator reef and grounded nearly 4 miles beyond after being totally disabled by the wind and sea with engine room flooded 23 this was just offshore of upper matecumbe key no one died and the ship was salvaged on sept 20 the american tanker pueblo drifted helplessly in the storm from 2 to 10 pm of september 2 she went out of control near 24.667 -80.417 and was carried completely around the storm center finding herself in 8 hours about 25 miles northeastward of her original position and just barely able to claw off molasses reef 23 however the ship that made the headlines was the american steamship dixie out of new orleans with a crew of 121 and 229 passengers 24 it ran aground on french reef near key largo without loss of life it was re floated on september 19 and towed to new york 2 florida east coast railway overseas railroad relief train derailed near islamorada florida during the 1935 labor day hurricane on upper matecumbe key near islamorada an eleven car evacuation train encountered a powerful storm surge topped by cresting waves eleven cars 25 were swept from the tracks leaving only the locomotive and tender upright and still on the rails remarkably everyone on the train survived 26 the locomotive and tender were both barged back to miami several months later the hurricane left a path of near destruction in the upper keys centered on what is today the village of islamorada the eye of the storm passed a few miles to the southwest creating a calm of about 40 minutes duration over lower matecumbe and 55 minutes pm over long key at camp 3 on lower matecumbe the surge arrived near the end of the calm with the wind close behind 27 nearly every structure was demolished and some bridges and railway embankments were washed away the road and ferry chained the islands together were broken the main transportation route linking the keys to mainland florida had been a single railroad line the florida overseas railroad portion of the florida east coast railway the islamorada area was devastated although the destructive path was narrower than most tropical cyclones its eye was eight miles across and the fiercest winds extended off the center less than hurricane andrew which was also a relatively small and catastrophic hurricane craig key long key and upper matecumbe and lower matecumbe keys suffered the worst the storm caused wind and flood damage along the florida panhandle and into georgia and significant damage to the tampa bay area 28 after the third day of the storm corpses swelled and split open in the subtropical heat according to rescue workers public health officials ordered plain wood coffins holding the dead to be stacked and burned in several locations the national weather service estimated 408 deaths from the hurricane bodies were recovered as far away as flamingo and cape sable on the southwest tip of the florida mainland the united states coast guard and other federal and state agencies organized evacuation and relief efforts boats and airplanes carried injured survivors to miami the railroad was never rebuilt but temporary bridges and ferry landings were under construction as soon as materials arrived on march 29 1938 the last gap in the overseas highway linking key west to the mainland was completed the new highway incorporated the roadbed and surviving bridges of the railway aftermath edit response edit veterans work camps edit three work camps existed in the florida keys before the hurricane 1 on windley key 3 and 5 on lower matecumbe key 29 the camp payrolls for august 30 listed 695 veterans 30 they were employed in a project to complete the overseas highway connecting the mainland with key west the camps including 7 in florida and 4 in south carolina were established by harry l hopkins director of the federal emergency relief administration fera in the autumn of 1934 the problem of transient veterans in washington dc to become acute and did become acute in 31 facilities in the capital were inadequate to handle the large numbers of veterans seeking jobs 32 33 president franklin d roosevelt met with mr hopkins and robert fechner director of the civilian conservation corps ccc to discuss solutions he the southern camp plan and approved the program worked out by mr hopkins for their establishment and 34 the va identified eligible veterans 35 fera offered grants to the states for their construction projects if they would accept the veterans as laborers the state emergency relief administrations were responsible for the daily management of the camps 36 in practice the state eras were very much the creatures of fera to the extent of handpicking the administrators 37 38 that only two states participated was perhaps attributable to the then popular impression that the transient veterans were bums and hoboes 39 it was a characterization enthusiastically fed by the media in august 1935 both time magazine 40 and the new york times published sensational articles 41 42 on aug 15 1935 hopkins announced the termination of the veterans work program and closure of all the camps 43 on august 26 and 27 1935 one of the veterans albert c keith wrote letters to both the president and eleanor roosevelt urging that the camps not be closed keith was editor of the weekly camp paper the key veteran news he was emphatic that the veterans were being defamed and that their work program was actually a success story rehabilitating many veterans for return to civilian life the news published occasional reports from camp 2 mullet key st petersburg florida at the entrance to tampa bay this was the colored veterans camp the keys camps were white only in early august the colored veterans were transferred to the new camp 8 in gainesville florida 44 rescue edit improved weather conditions on wednesday september 4 permitted the evacuation of survivors to begin participating in the rescue were american red cross florida national guard federal emergency relief administration fera works progress administration wpa civilian conservation corps ccc united states coast guard american legion 45 veterans of foreign wars dade county undertakers association dade county medical society city and county officials and numerous individuals including ernest hemingway headquarters of the operation was the near shore of snake creek on plantation key with the bridge over the creek washed out this was the farthest point south on the highway on september 5 at a meeting of all public and private agencies involved governor david sholtz placed the sheriffs of monroe and dade counties in overall control 46 on the evening of september 4 1935 brigadier general frank t hines va administrator received a phone call from hyde park new york it was stephen early the press secretary he had orders from the president who was very distressed by the news from florida the va was to 1 cooperate with fera in seeing that everything possible be done for those injured in the hurricane 2 see that the bodies were properly cared for shipment home to relatives and that those bodies for which shipment home was not requested be sent to arlington national cemetery and 3 conduct a very careful joint investigation with mr organization to determine whether there was any fault that would lie against anyone in the administration representative in florida was to take full charge of the situation and all other organizations and agencies were ordered to cooperate 47 the first order was straight forward and promptly executed 124 injured veterans were treated in miami area hospitals 9 of these died 56 were later transferred to va medical facilities 48 uninjured veterans were removed to camp foster in jacksonville and evaluated for transfer to the ccc those declining transfer or deemed unemployable were paid off and given tickets home 49 all of the fera transient camps were closed in november 1935 50 in december 1935 fera itself was absorbed within the new wpa also directed by hopkins 51 recovery edit the second and third orders however were almost immediately compromised at a news conference on september 5 hopkins asserted that there was no negligence traceable to fera in the failed evacuation of the camps as the weather bureau advisories had given insufficient warning he also dispatched his assistant aubrey willis williams to florida to coordinate fera efforts and to investigate the deaths 52 williams and assistant colonel george e ijams both arrived in miami on september 6 ijams concentrated on the dead their collection identification and proper disposition 53 this was to prove exceptionally difficult bodies were scattered throughout the keys and their rapid decomposition created ghastly conditions state and local health officials demanded a ban on all movement of bodies and their immediate burial or cremation in place the next day governor sholtz so ordered 54 this was reluctantly agreed to by hines with the understanding that those buried would be later disinterred and shipped home or to arlington when permitted by the state health authorities 55 the cremations began on saturday september 7 38 bodies were burned together at the collection point beside snake creek over the next week 136 bodies were cremated on upper matecumbe key at 12 different locations on lower matecumbe key 82 were burned at 20 sites on numerous small keys in florida bay bodies were either burned or buried where found this effort continued into november 123 bodies had been transported to miami before the embargo these were processed at a temporary morgue staffed by fingerprint experts and 8 volunteer undertakers under tents at woodlawn park cemetery 3260 sw 8th st miami the intention was to identify the remains and prepare them for burial or further shipment with the embargo in force immediate burial of all the bodies at woodlawn was mandatory fera purchased a plot in section 2a the va coordinated the ceremony with full military honors on september 8 56 109 bodies were buried in the fera plot 81 veterans 9 civilians and 19 unidentified bodies 57 some records claim 259 veterans were victims of the hurricane 47 civilians and 34 veterans cremated 61 civilians and 128 veterans unknown cremated total 108 civilians and 162 veterans cremated of the rest 42 civilians and 81 veterans known buried 6 civilians and 9 veterans sent to relatives 7 civilians and 7 veterans unknown buried total 55 civilians and 97 veterans buried total 163 civilians and 259 veterans 422 58 although the congressional record 59 gives a report of 485 victims of the hurricane 257 veterans and 259 civilians 60 the record also breaks down 694 world war i veterans by name and their status as survived 443 number 437 living 6 living identification tentative died 251 broken down as 2 listed as of remains not listed 6 reburied in hometowns 26 cremated 44 tentatively identified as dead 84 reburied in woodlawn cemetery miami 89 dead 61 veterans storm relief map collection of hurricane victims sept 7 1935 cremation of hurricane victims snake creek sep 8 1935 mass burial at woodlawn park cemetery the florida emergency relief administration reported that as of november 19 1935 the total of dead stood at 423 259 veterans and 164 civilians these numbers are reflected on the veterans storm relief map which see by march 1 1936 62 additional bodies had been recovered bringing the total to 485 257 veterans and 228 civilians 62 the discrepancy in deaths resulted from the difficulty in identifying bodies particularly those found months after the hurricane and a question of definition whether to count just those on the camp payrolls or to include others not enrolled who happened to be veterans the affairs administration va compiled its own list of deaths 121 dead positive identification 90 missing and 45 dead identification tentative totaling 256 five others are named in a footnote one proved to be a misidentification of a previously listed veteran two were state employees working at the camps and two were unaffiliated veterans caught in the storm this gives a total for all veterans of 260 63 adding this to the florida emergency relief administration number for civilians gives a total of 488 for all deaths 12 of the dead were listed as colored 64 ernest hemingway visited the camp by boat after weathering the hurricane at his home in key west he wrote about the devastation in a critical article titled who killed the vets for the new masses magazine 65 hemingway implied that the fera workers and families who were unfamiliar with the risks of florida hurricane season were unwitting victims of a system that appeared to lack concern for their welfare from ernest statement on the tragedy 66 wealthy people yachtsmen fishermen such as president hoover and president roosevelt do not come to the florida keys in hurricane months there is a known danger to property but veterans especially the bonus marching variety of veterans are not property they are only human beings unsuccessful human beings and all they have to lose is their lives they are doing coolie labor for a top wage of $45 a month and they have been put down on the florida keys where they make trouble it is hurricane months sure but if anything comes up you can always evacuate them you it is not necessary to go into the deaths of the civilians and their families since they were on the keys of their own free will they made their living there had property and knew the hazards involved but the veterans had been sent there they had no opportunity to leave nor any protection against hurricanes and they never had a chance for their lives who sent nearly a thousand war veterans many of them husky hard working and simply out of luck but many of them close to the border of pathological cases to live in frame shacks on the florida keys in hurricane months in the same issue of the new masses appeared an editorial charging criminal negligence and a cartoon by russell t limbach captioned an act of god depicting burning corpses 67 a washington post editorial on sept 5 titled ruin in the veterans camps stated the widely held opinion that the were havens of rest designed to keep bonus marchers away from washington most of these veterans are drifters psychopathic cases or habitual troublemakers those who are nor physically or mentally handicapped have no claim whatsoever to special rewards in return for bonus agitation 68 investigation edit williams meanwhile rushed to complete the investigation he finished on sunday september 8 the day an elaborate memorial service and mass burial of hurricane victims both coordinated by ijams were held in miami 69 ijams who had been too busy to participate in the investigation and had not questioned any of the 12 witnesses interrogated by williams nonetheless signed the 15 page report to the president 70 that night williams released it to the miami press in a radio broadcast immediately following the memorial ceremony ijams considered the timing unfortunate after receiving several critical telephone messages 71 the report exonerated everyone involved and concluded our mind the catastrophe must be characterized as an act of god and was by its very nature beyond the power of man or instruments at his disposal to foresee sufficiently far enough in advance to permit the taking of adequate precautions capable of preventing the death and desolation which 72 early also found the publicity around the report unfortunate in a telegram to his colleague assistant presidential secretary marvin h mcintyre early wrote that he had authorized hines to proceed with a complete and exhaustive joint investigation with hopkins significantly hines was to instruct his investigator that under no circumstances will any statement be made to the press until final report has been submitted to the president 73 hopkins gave similar instructions to his investigator mcintyre also was involved in damage control on sept 10 1935 the greater miami ministerial association wrote the president an angry letter labeling the report a whitewash mcintyre forwarded it to fera for a response williams returned a draft for the signature on sept 25th insisting the report was only preliminary and that the final and detailed report will be both thorough and searching 74 williams assigned john abt assistant general counsel for fera to complete the investigation on sept 11 1935 hines directed the skeptical and meticulous david w kennamer to investigate the disaster there was immediate friction between them kennamer believed abt did not have an open mind and abt felt further investigation was unnecessary 75 working with harry w farmer another va investigator kennamer completed his 2 volume report on october 30 1935 farmer added a third volume concerning the identification of the veterans report included 2,168 pages of exhibits 76 118 pages of findings 77 and a 19 page general comment 78 his findings differed substantially from those of williams citing three officials of the florida emergency relief administration as negligent administrator conrad van hyning asst administrator fred ghent and camp superintendent ray sheldon in a response to draft report to the president 79 ijams sided with kennamer 80 hines and hopkins never agreed on a final report and findings were suppressed they remained so for decades 81 one might speculate that hines wished to avoid a public quarrel with hopkins who had enjoyed patronage since his term as new york governor hines was a holdover from the hoover administration such an internal dispute would embarrass the roosevelt administration at the time a vote on the adjusted compensation payment act was upcoming it passed on jan 27 1936 over the veto 82 also 1936 was a presidential election year kennamer did appear at the house hearings in april 1936 along with hines ijams williams and the 3 officials he pilloried in his report he was not questioned about his controversial findings nor did he volunteer his opinions 83 on november 1 1935 the american legion completed its own report on the hurricane the national commander ray murphy mailed a copy to president roosevelt it concluded that the blame for the loss of life can be placed on inefficiency indifference and ignorance inefficiency in the setup of the camps indifference of someone in charge as to the safety of the men ignorance of the real danger from a tropical hurricane and these can be added together and they spell murder at matacombe sic the committee early in its investigation noticed a tendency on the part of some to reflect on the character of the men who were veterans in the camps several parties referred to them as bums drunkards crazy men riff raff and the like they seem to think that they got what was coming to them how anyone could arrive at such a conclusion is impossible for us to determine if these men were bums drunkards crazy men etc then it was all the more necessary that every precaution be taken to protect them if they fell into this category they were subnormal men and should have been treated as such if they were incapable of caring for themselves then the government should have placed them in hospitals and not have sent them to a wilderness in the high seas on a so called rehabilitation program others testified that the men were well behaved and that a great majority of them would have preferred to have been placed under military discipline in the camps but these observations are of no real value except to show that some people are trying to cover up the real guilt of responsible parties 84 williams prepared a response for the president stating a final report based upon the facts obtained in this investigation by the va and fera will be submitted to me shortly at that time i shall transmit a copy of the report to you for your information and consideration 85 memorials edit islamorada edit standing just east of u s 1 at mile marker 82 in islamorada near where post office stood is a simple monument 86 designed by the florida division of the federal art project and constructed using keys limestone keystone by the works progress administration it was unveiled on november 14 1937 with several hundred people attending 87 hines had been invited to speak but he declined 88 his attitude to the project was unenthusiastic in a letter to williams on june 24 1937 regarding what to do with the many skeletons of veterans recently discovered in the keys he wrote occurs to me that if a large memorial is erected adjacent to this highway at the place of the disaster it will be observed by all persons using the highway and will serve as a constant reminder of the unfortunate catastrophe which 89 hines recommended the remains be buried at woodlawn a frieze depicts palm trees amid curling waves fronds bent in the wind in front of the sculpture a ceramic tile mural of the keys covers a stone crypt which holds victims ashes from the makeshift funeral pyres commingled with the skeletons 87 although this is a grave site not a single name appears anywhere on the monument this is not a requirement for the estimated 228 civilian dead 55 of whom were buried where found or in various cemeteries 90 a memorial with identifying information is a statutory entitlement for the veterans 91 170 were cremated or never identified the va has chosen not to memorialize them despite current federal law and president order that hines provide a burial with full military honors for every veteran not claimed by his family on february 18 1939 president roosevelt had the opportunity to see the memorial for himself his motorcade passed through islamorada on the way to key west where he was to begin a visit with the battle fleet on maneuvers but there is no record that he made a stop no mention in newspaper reports 92 the daily calendar 93 or in a press conference 94 held during a lunch stop at the ccc camp on west summerland key renamed scout key in 2010 this omission is puzzling in that he had sent a telegram to the dedication in which he expressed and said disaster which made desolate the hearts of so many of our people brought a personal sorrow to me because some years ago i knew many residents of the 87 the welcoming committee included key west mayor willard m albury and other local officials 95 dedication of florida keys

2012 any person with knowledge of the veteran could apply the revision prompted objections from groups and volunteers working to mark the many unmarked graves mostly from the civil war era they argued that the next of kin if any was often impossible to locate and that the very existence of an unmarked grave was evidence of the indifference 111 two bills were introduced in congress h r 2018 and s
