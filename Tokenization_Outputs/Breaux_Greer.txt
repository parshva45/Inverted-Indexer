2008 2012 and 2016 championships incorporated the olympic trials otherwise held as a discrete event notes ken churchill had the longest throw in the 1932 competition which doubled as the olympic trials ahead of malcolm metcalf however churchill qualified for the final only due to a late rule change by the u s olympic committee allowing eight rather than five finalists as this rule change applied only to the olympic trials churchill is considered to have won at the trials and metcalf at the national championships even though they were the same meet v t e 2000 usa olympic track field
