footnotes 1 the john f kennedy space center ksc is one of ten national aeronautics and space administration field centers since december 1968 kennedy space center has been primary launch center of human spaceflight launch operations for the apollo skylab and space shuttle programs were carried out from kennedy space center launch complex 39 and managed by ksc 2 located on the east coast of florida ksc is adjacent to cape canaveral air force station ccafs the management of the two entities work very closely together share resources and even own facilities on each property though the first apollo flights and all project mercury and project gemini flights took off from ccafs the launches were managed by ksc and its previous organization the launch operations directorate 3 4 starting with the fourth gemini mission the nasa launch control center in florida mercury control center later the launch control center began handing off control of the vehicle to the mission control center shortly after liftoff in prior missions it held control throughout the entire mission 5 6 additionally the center manages launch of robotic and commercial crew missions researches food production and in situ resource utilization for off earth exploration 7 and more since 2010 the center has worked to become a multi user spaceport through industry partnerships 8 even adding a new launch pad lc 39c in 2015 there are about 700 facilities grouped across the 144,000 acres 9 among the unique facilities at ksc are the tall vehicle assembly building for stacking largest rockets the

bibliography 12 external links formation edit the military had been performing launch operations since 1949 at what would become cape canaveral air force station in december 1959 the department of defense transferred 5,000 personnel and the missile firing laboratory to nasa to become the launch operations directorate under marshall space flight center president john f kennedy s 1961 goal of a manned lunar landing before 1970 required an expansion of launch operations on july 1 1962 the launch operations directorate was separated from msfc to become the launch operations center loc also cape canaveral was inadequate to host the new launch facility design required for the mammoth 363 foot tall 7 500 000 pound force thrust saturn v rocket which would be assembled vertically in a large hangar and transported on a mobile platform to one of several launch pads therefore the decision was made to build a new loc site located adjacent to cape canaveral on merritt island nasa began land acquisition in 1962 buying title to 131 square miles 2 and negotiating with the state of florida for an additional 87 square miles 2 10 the major buildings in industrial area were designed by architect charles luckman 11 construction began in november 1962 and kennedy visited the site twice in 1962 and again just a week before his assassination on november 22 1963 12 on november 29 1963 the facility was given its current name by president lyndon b johnson under executive order 11129 13 14 order joined both the civilian loc and the military cape canaveral station the facilities of station no 1 of the atlantic missile range under the designation john f kennedy space center spawning some confusion joining the two in the public mind nasa administrator james e webb clarified this by issuing a directive stating the kennedy space center name applied only to the loc while the air force issued a general order renaming the military launch site cape kennedy air force station 15 location edit located on merritt island florida the center is north northwest of cape canaveral on the atlantic ocean midway between miami and jacksonville on space coast due east of orlando it is 34 miles long and roughly six miles wide covering 219 square miles 2 ksc is a major central florida tourist destination and is approximately one drive from the orlando area the kennedy space center visitor complex offers public tours of the center and cape canaveral air force station because much of the installation is a restricted area and only nine percent of the land is developed the site also serves as an important wildlife sanctuary mosquito lagoon indian river merritt island national wildlife refuge and canaveral national seashore are other features of the area center workers can encounter bald eagles american alligators wild boars eastern diamondback rattlesnakes the endangered florida panther citation needed and florida manatees historical programs edit apollo program edit main articles apollo program and list of apollo missions a saturn v carrying apollo 15 rolls out to pad 39a in 1971 on mobile launch platform 1 from 1967 through 1973 there were 13 saturn v launches including the ten remaining apollo missions after apollo 7 the first of two unmanned flights apollo 4 apollo saturn 501 on november 9 1967 was also the first rocket launch from ksc the saturn first manned launch on december 21 1968 was apollo 8 s lunar orbiting mission the next two missions tested the lunar module apollo 9 earth orbit and apollo 10 lunar orbit apollo 11 launched from pad a on july 16 1969 made the first moon landing on july 20 apollo 12 followed four months later from the apollo program concluded at ksc with the launches of missions 13 through 17 skylab edit on may 14 1973 the last saturn v launch put the skylab space station in orbit from pad 39a by this time the cape kennedy pads 34 and 37 used for the saturn ib were decommissioned and pad b was modified to launch three manned missions to skylab that year as well as the final apollo spacecraft for the test project in 1975 space shuttle edit main articles space shuttle program and list of space shuttle missions shuttle discovery launching from pad 39a on sts 60 february 3 1994 as the space shuttle was being designed nasa received proposals for building alternative launch and landing sites at locations other than ksc which demanded study ksc had important advantages including its existing facilities location on the intracoastal waterway and its southern latitude which gives a velocity advantage to missions launched in easterly near equatorial orbits disadvantages included its inability to safely launch military missions into polar orbit since spent boosters would be likely to fall on the carolinas or cuba corrosion from the salt air and frequent cloudy or stormy weather although building a new site at white sands missile range in new mexico was seriously considered nasa announced its decision in april 1972 to use ksc for the shuttle 16 since the shuttle could not be landed automatically or by remote control the launch of columbia on april 12 1981 for its first orbital mission sts 1 was first manned launch of a vehicle that had not been tested in prior unmanned launches shuttle atlantis is moved to pad 39a for the 1990 launch of sts 36 in 1976 the south parking area was the site of third century america a science and technology display commemorating the u s bicentennial concurrent with this event the u s flag was painted on the south side of the vab during the late 1970s lc 39 was reconfigured to support the space shuttle two orbiter processing facilities were built near the vab as hangars with a third added in the 1980s 2 9 mile shuttle landing facility slf was the orbiters primary end of mission landing site although the first ksc landing did not take place until the tenth flight when challenger completed sts 41 b on february 11 1984 the primary landing site until then was edwards air force base in california subsequently used as a backup landing site the slf also provided a return to launch site rtls abort option which was not utilized the slf is among the longest runways in the world 17 after 24 successful shuttle flights challenger was torn apart 73 seconds after the launch of sts 51 l on january 28 1986 the first shuttle launch from pad 39b and the first u s manned launch failure killing the seven crew members an o ring seal in the right booster rocket failed at liftoff leading to subsequent structural failures flights resumed on september 29 1988 with sts 26 after modifications to many aspects of the shuttle program on february 1 2003 columbia and her crew of seven were lost during re entry over texas during the sts 107 mission the 113th shuttle flight a vehicle breakup triggered by damage sustained during launch from pad 39a on january 16 when a piece of foam insulation from the external fuel tank struck the left wing during reentry the damage created a hole allowing hot gases to melt the wing structure like the challenger disaster the resulting investigation and modifications interrupted shuttle flight operations at ksc for more than two years until the sts 114 launch on july 26 2005 the shuttle program experienced five main engine shutdowns at lc 39 all within four seconds before launch and one abort to orbit sts 51 f on july 29 1985 shuttle missions during nearly 30 years of operations included deploying satellites and interplanetary probes conducting space science and technology experiments visits to the russian mir space station construction and servicing of the international space station deployment and servicing of the hubble space telescope and serving as a space laboratory the shuttle was retired from service in july 2011 after 135 launches constellation edit on october 28 2009 the ares i x launch from pad 39b was the first unmanned launch from ksc since the skylab workshop in 1973 expendable launch vehicles elvs edit beginning in 1958 nasa and military worked side by side on robotic mission launches previously referred to as unmanned 18 cooperating as they broke ground in the field in the early 1960s nasa had as many as two robotic mission launches a month the frequent number of flights allowed for quick evolution of the vehicles as engineers gathered data learned from anomalies and implemented upgrades in 1963 with the intent of ksc elv work focusing on the ground support equipment and facilities a separate atlas centaur organization was formed under lewis center now glenn research center grc taking that responsibility from the launch operations center aka ksc 6 though almost all robotics missions launched from the cape canaveral air force station ccafs ksc oversaw the final assembly and testing of rockets as they arrived at the cape 6 in 1965 unmanned launch operations directorate became responsible all nasa unmanned launch operations including those at vandenberg air force base from the 1950s to 1978 ksc chose the rocket and payload processing facilities for all robotic missions launching in the u s overseeing their near launch processing and checkout in addition to government missions ksc performed this service for commercial and foreign missions also though non u s government entities provided reimbursement nasa also funded ccafs launch pad maintenance and launch vehicle improvements all this changed with the commercial space launch act of 1984 after which nasa only coordinated its own and national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa elv launches companies were able to operate their own launch vehicles 6 and utilize launch facilities payload processing handled by private firms also started to occur outside of ksc 1988 space policy furthered the movement of this work from ksc to commercial companies 19 that same year launch complexes on ccafs started transferring from nasa to air force management 6 in the 1990s though ksc was not performing the hands on elv work engineers still maintained understanding of elvs and had contracts allowing them insight in the vehicles so they could provide knowledgeable oversight ksc also worked on elv research and analysis and the contractors were able to utilize ksc personnel as a resource for technical issues ksc with the payload and launch vehicle industries developed advances in automation of the elv launch and ground operations for the purpose of enabling competitiveness of u s rockets against the global market 6 in 1998 the launch services program lsp formed at ksc pulling together programs and personnel that already existed at ksc grc goddard space flight center and more to manage the launch of nasa and noaa robotic missions ccafs and vafb are the primary launch sites for lsp missions though other sites are occasionally used lsp payloads such as the mars science laboratory have been processed at ksc before being transferred to a launch pad on ccafs space station processing edit as the international space station modules design began in the early 1990s ksc began to work with other nasa centers and international partners to prepare for processing prior to launch on board the space shuttles ksc utilized its hands on experience processing the 22 spacelab missions in the operations and checkout building to gather expectations of iss processing these experiences were incorporated into the design of the space station processing facility sspf which began construction in 1993 the space station directorate formed in 1996 ksc personnel were embedded at station module factories for insight into their processes 6 from 1997 to 2007 ksc planned and performed on the ground integration tests and checkouts of station modules three multi element integration testing meit sessions and the integration systems test ist numerous issues were found and corrected that would have been difficult to nearly impossible to do on orbit today ksc continues to process iss payloads from across the world prior to launch along with developing its own experiments for on orbit 20 current programs and initiatives edit the following are current programs and initiatives at kennedy space center 21 commercial crew program 22 ground systems development and operations program 23 nasa is currently designing the next heavy launch vehicle known as the space launch system sls

provide ideal conditions for electrical storms earning central florida the reputation as lightning capital of the united states 55 56 this makes extensive lightning protection and detection systems necessary to protect employees structures and spacecraft on launch pads 57 on november 14 1969 apollo 12 was struck by lightning just after lift off from pad 39a but the flight continued safely the most powerful lightning strike recorded at ksc occurred at lc 39b on august 25 2006 while shuttle atlantis was being prepared for sts 115 nasa managers were initially concerned that the lightning strike caused damage to atlantis but none was found 58 on september 7 2004 hurricane frances directly hit the area with sustained winds of 70 miles per hour and gusts up to 94 miles per hour the most damaging storm to date the vehicle assembly building lost 1,000 exterior panels each 3.9 feet x 9.8 feet in size this exposed 2 of the building to the elements damage occurred to the south and east

from marshall space flight center in july 1962 it took 375 employees with it in may 1965 ksc had 7,000 employees and contractors move from rented space in cocoa beach to the new merritt island facilities the peak number of persons working on center was 26,000 in 1968 3,000 were civil servants in 1970 president nixon announced intent to reduce cost of space operations and major cuts occurred at ksc by 1974 workforce was down to 10,000 employees 2,408 civil servants 6 a total of 13,100 people worked at the center as of 2011 approximately 2,100 are employees of the federal government the rest are contractors 70 the average annual salary for an on site worker in 2008 was $77,235. 71 the end of the space shuttle program in 2011 preceded by the cancellation of constellation program in 2010 produced a significant downsizing of the ksc workforce similar to that experienced at the end of the apollo program in 1972 as part of this downsizing 6,000 contractors lost their jobs at the
