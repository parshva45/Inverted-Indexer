of florida the area of the modern city of jacksonville has been inhabited for thousands of years on black hammock island in the national timucuan ecological and historic preserve a university of north florida team discovered some of the oldest remnants of pottery in the united states dating to 2500 bc 18 in the 16th century the beginning of the historical era the region was inhabited by the mocama a coastal subgroup of the timucua people at the time of contact with europeans all mocama villages in present day jacksonville were part of the powerful chiefdom known as the saturiwa centered around the mouth of the st johns river 19 one early map shows a village called ossachite at the site of what is now downtown jacksonville this may be the earliest recorded name for that area 20 replica of jean ribault s column claiming florida for france in 1562 french huguenot explorer jean ribault charted the st johns river in 1562 calling it the river of may because that was the month of his

the main village of the saturiwa philip ii of spain ordered pedro de to protect the interest of spain by attacking the french presence at fort caroline on september 20 1565 a spanish force from the nearby spanish settlement of st augustine attacked fort caroline and killed nearly all the french soldiers defending it 22 the spanish renamed the fort san mateo and following the ejection of the

at a narrow point which the seminole called wacca pilatka and the british called the cow ford these names ostensibly reflect the fact that cattle were brought across the river there 24 25 26 the british introduced the cultivation of sugar cane indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber as a result the northeastern florida area prospered economically more than it had under the spanish 27 britain ceded control of the territory to spain in 1783 after being defeated in the american revolutionary war and the settlement at the cow ford continued to grow after spain ceded the florida territory to the united states in 1821 american settlers on the north side of the cow ford decided to plan a town laying out the streets and plats they soon named the town jacksonville after andrew
