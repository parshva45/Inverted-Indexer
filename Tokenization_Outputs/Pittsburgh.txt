edit main articles history of pittsburgh etymology of pittsburgh and timeline of pittsburgh historical claims french empire british empire united states pittsburgh was named in 1758 by general john forbes in honor of british statesman william pitt 1st earl of chatham the original pronunciation would have been p t s b r b r pits or pits matching similarly named places in great britain such as edinburgh in scotland and aldeburgh in suffolk 19 pittsburgh was incorporated as a township in 1771 and as a borough on april 22 1794 with the following act 20 be it enacted by the pennsylvania state senate and pennsylvania house of representatives of the commonwealth of pennsylvania by the authority of the same that the said town of pittsburgh shall be erected into a borough which shall be called the borough of pittsburgh for ever 21 the current pronunciation which is extremely unusual in english speaking countries is almost certainly a result of a printing error in some copies of the city charter of march 18 1816 though not on the original document the error was repeated commonly enough throughout the rest of the 19th century that the original pronunciation was lost and in 1890 the h was removed in order to make it easier to spell after a public campaign the original spelling was officially restored by the united states board on geographic names in 1911 21 the area of the ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the shawnee and several other settled groups of native americans 22 the first known european to enter the region was the french explorer trader robert de la salle from quebec during his 1669 expedition down the ohio river 23 european pioneers primarily dutch followed in the early 18th century michael bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the ohio in a 1717 manuscript and later that year european fur traders established area posts and settlements 24 in 1749 french soldiers from quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite canada with french louisiana via the rivers 24 during the british hastily built fort prince george before a larger french force drove them off the french built fort duquesne based on 1669 claims the french and indian

duquesne 25 the british and colonial force were defeated at field general john forbes finally took the forks in 1758 forbes began construction on fort pitt named after william pitt the elder while the settlement was named pittsborough 26 during rebellion native tribes conducted a siege of fort pitt for two months until colonel henry bouquet relieved it after the battle of bushy run fort pitt is notable as the site of an early use of smallpox for biological warfare lord jeffrey amherst ordered blankets contaminated from smallpox victims to be distributed in 1763 to the tribes surrounding the fort the disease spread into other areas infected other tribes and killed hundreds of thousands 27 28 not in citation given during this period the powerful nations of the iroquois confederacy based in new york had maintained control of much of the ohio valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes by the terms of the 1768 treaty of fort stanwix the penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the iroquois a 1769 survey referenced the future city as the manor of pittsburgh 29 both the colony of virginia and the province of pennsylvania claimed the region

from the merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the merthyr rising by the 1840s pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the allegheny mountains the great fire of pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845 the city rebuilt with the aid of irish immigrants and by 1857 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly coal mining and iron

mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel for the war effort 26 this resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the almost century of industry the reputation as the arsenal of democracy 36 37 was being overshadowed by james parton s 1868 observation of pittsburgh being hell with the lid off 38 following the war the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the renaissance cleaning up the air and the rivers the renaissance ii project followed in 1977 focused on cultural and neighborhood development the industrial base

pittsburgh was ranked 24th among u s metro areas 66 67 the area has improved its air quality with every annual survey the rankings have been disputed by the allegheny county health department achd since data from only the worst of the 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ala without any context or averaging the lone monitor used is located immediately downwind and adjacent to u s clairton coke works the largest coke mill and several municipalities outside the jurisdiction of pollution controls leading to possible confusion that pittsburgh itself is the source or center of the
