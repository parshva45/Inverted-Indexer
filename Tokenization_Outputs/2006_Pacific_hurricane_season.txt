responsibility which is east of and one storm formed between and the international date line which is under the jurisdiction of the central pacific hurricane center cphc of the storms eleven became hurricanes of which six attained major hurricane status within the nhc portion of the basin the season officially began on may 15 and in the cphc portion it started on june 1 the season officially ended on november 30 these dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the eastern pacific basin the strongest storm of the season was hurricane ioke which reached category 5 status on the saffir simpson scale in the central pacific ocean ioke passed near johnston atoll and later wake island where it caused heavy damage but no deaths the deadliest storm of the season was hurricane john which killed six people after striking the baja california peninsula and the costliest storm was hurricane lane which caused in damage in southwestern mexico 2006 usd seasonal activity began on may 27 when tropical storm aletta formed off the southwest coast of mexico no storms formed in june though the season became active in july when five named storms developed including hurricane daniel which was the second strongest storm of the season as well as tropical storm emilia during august hurricanes ioke and john formed as well as four other storms september was a relatively quiet month with two storms of which one was hurricane lane three storms developed in october including hurricane paul and two formed in november this marked the second time on record

main article timeline of the 2006 pacific hurricane season no tropical storms developed in june in the basin which was unusual compared to the average of two storms forming during the month since 1966 there have been only three other seasons in which a tropical storm did not form in june these being 1969 2004 and 2007 7 after such an inactive month the tropics became active in july when five named storms developed including hurricane daniel which was the second strongest storm of the season during august hurricanes ioke and john formed as well as four other storms september was a relatively quiet month with two storms of which one was hurricane lane 8 by that time however el conditions became established across the pacific 9 which is known to enhance pacific hurricane activity 3 three storms developed in october including hurricane paul 8 tropical activity within the basin in was the most active on record based on the accumulated cyclone energy ace index three tropical cyclones formed of which two became tropical storms only two other seasons on record 1961 and 2015 produced two tropical storms in the month of november 10 in addition mexico was struck by four tropical cyclones in 2006 none on the atlantic coast and all along the pacific coast 11 one hit baja california peninsula while the others made landfall on the mainland 12 an extratropical storm persisted in the extreme northern central pacific ocean in late october it drifted over unusually warm waters up to above normal and gradually developed convection near the center by november 2 quikscat satellite

upgraded further to status on the saffir simpson hurricane scale its peak intensity was 27 the hurricane underwent eyewall replacement cycles which are internal mechanisms that occur in most intense hurricanes daniel later became an annular hurricane which allowed it to maintain status for longer than it otherwise would have 28 it crossed over into the central pacific early on and was predicted to affect hawaii as a tropical storm however daniel encountered weak steering currents in the open ocean causing it to slow down considerably 27 it rapidly degenerated to a tropical depression on and

continued westward moving across hawaii on 33 although fabio did not impact land its remnants produced heavy rainfall in hawaii in a 24 hour period of rainfall was recorded at glenwood on the island of hawaii this was the highest daily rainfall total for the month on the island however the heaviest precipitation fell on mount on kauai where fell in this total alone was greater than all other monthly rainfall totals in the state 34 the heavy rainfall flooded the hanalei river which forced the closure of the kuhio highway when a bridge was inundated 33 on oahu the rainfall caused ponding on

baja california 8 hector remained a category 2 hurricane for about 8 shortly thereafter it encountered cooler waters and westerly shear 39 and hector steadily weakened until becoming a tropical storm by shortly thereafter the storm reached a weakness in the subtropical ridge which caused it to move slowly to the northwest by deep convection was confined to the northeast portion of the circulation 40 the shear was not strong enough to completely weaken the tropical cyclone and hector remained a tropical storm with winds for about 38 after the remaining shower and thunderstorm activity dissipated on the cyclone turned westward in response to the low level easterly wind flow 41 hector weakened to a tropical depression at on and to a remnant low later the remnant circulation of hector

category 4 status within late on it rapidly weakened to status before crossing over johnston atoll two days later favorable conditions again allowed for rapid strengthening and ioke attained status on august crossing the international date line at the time its barometric pressure was estimated at 915 mbar thus becoming the strongest hurricane on record in the central pacific 9 as it continued westward its intensity fluctuated and on it passed near wake island with winds of ioke gradually weakened as it turned northwestward and northward and by it had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone 43 by then the cyclone had lasted reaching the equivalent of category 5 status on the saffir simpson hurricane scale three times 9 the remnants of ioke accelerated northeastward and ultimately crossed into alaska 44 ioke did not affect any permanently populated areas in the central pacific or western pacific basins as a hurricane or a typhoon a crew of stayed in a hurricane proof bunker on johnston atoll during the passage the crew estimated winds reached over which damaged trees on the island but did not impact the bird population 9 45 the hurricane left moderate damage on wake island totaling which resulted from blown off roofs and damaged buildings although the infrastructure of the island was left intact all military personnel were evacuated from the island the first full scale evacuation of the island since typhoon sarah in 1967 46 47 48 later the extratropical remnants of ioke produced a severe storm surge along the alaskan coastline causing beach erosion 49 hurricane

later the hurricane underwent another eyewall replacement cycle 54 and subsequently weakened to status as it paralleled the mexican coastline a short distance offshore 55 potentially due to its eyewall replacement cycle or its interaction with land hurricane john weakened to a hurricane by late on 56 but restrengthened to a major hurricane shortly after it made landfall near the southern tip of the baja california peninsula as a hurricane on 57 john continued northwestward along the eastern baja california peninsula weakening to tropical depression status by and dissipating on in the gulf

california peninsula the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall with a 24 hour peak of in los planes 59 the heavy rainfall caused flooding closed roads 60 and caused a dam to overflow 61 the winds and rainfall destroyed thousands of flimsy houses across the region 62 across mexico five people were killed 53 and damage amounted to 2006 mxn 2006 usd 63 moisture from the remnants of john produced flooding across texas which closed a portion of interstate 10 in el paso 64 in southern new mexico the rainfall caused widespread street flooding and some minor damage 65 tropical moisture from the

persistent convection the cphc classified the system as tropical depression four c about southwest of honolulu hawaii upon being classified the depression was located in an unusual steering flow that caused it to track eastward due to the approach of an upper level trough it was expected to dissipate quickly from wind shear although forecasters noted the possibility for the trough to provide an outflow channel which might allow strengthening 83 on strong wind shear removed the convection completely from the center and the system degenerated into a remnant low 9 the remnant circulation

shear and the nhc anticipated further organization and strengthening to near hurricane status 91 the tropical depression initially maintained a steady westward motion away from the mexican coastline due to a ridge north of the cyclone 91 by convection had decreased and the depression was not forecast to intensify as much 92 possibly due to intrusion of dry air the circulation became exposed from
