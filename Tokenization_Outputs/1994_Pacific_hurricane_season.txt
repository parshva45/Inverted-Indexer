final season of the eastern north most recent active string of hurricane seasons that unofficially started in 1981 the season officially started on may 15 1994 in the eastern pacific and on june 1 1994 in the central pacific and lasted until november 30 1994 these dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern pacific ocean the first tropical cyclone formed on june 18 while the last system dissipated on october 26 1 this season twenty two tropical cyclones formed in the north pacific ocean east of the dateline with all but two becoming tropical storms or hurricanes a total of 10 hurricanes occurred including five major hurricanes of note in this season is an unusual spree of very intense storms hurricanes emilia gilma john and olivia all reached a pressure below 930 millibars longevity wise no tropical cyclone of any basin had previously persisted for as long as hurricane john which lasted 31 days elsewhere hurricane

active pacific hurricane seasons 1 9 beginning in 1995 multi decadal factors switched to a phase that suppresses pacific hurricane activity 10 since then pacific hurricane seasons have generally been below normal 11 the lone abnormally active season since then was in 1997 where a strong el nino event was observed 9 the 1994 pacific hurricane season set several records first three hurricanes reached intensity on the saffir simpson hurricane scale 8 setting a record later tied in 2002 1 hurricane john lasted longer and spent more time tropical than any other tropical cyclone on earth in

defines above normal as having an ace above 150 10 4 kt 2 along with the numbers of any two of the following above average tropical storms 15 hurricanes 9 or major hurricanes 4 it defines near normal
