cubesat wikipedia cubesat from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search ncube 2 a norwegian cubesat cube a cubesat u class spacecraft 1 is a type of miniaturized satellite for space research that is made up of multiples of cubic units cubesats have a mass of no more than 1.33 kilograms per unit 2 and often use commercial off the shelf cots components for their electronics and structure cubesats are most commonly put in orbit by deployers on the international space station or launched as secondary payload s on a launch vehicle 3 in 1999 california polytechnic state university cal poly and stanford university developed the cubesat specifications to promote and develop the skills necessary for the design manufacture and testing of small satellites intended for low earth orbit leo that perform a number of scientific research functions and explore new space technologies academia accounted for the majority of cubesat launches until 2013 when over half of launches were for non academic purposes and by 2014 most newly deployed cubesats were for commercial or amateur projects 3 cubesats have been built by large and small companies alike while other projects have been the subject of kickstarter campaigns 4 uses typically involve experiments which can be miniaturized or serve purposes such as earth observation or amateur radio many cubesats are used to demonstrate spacecraft technologies that are targeted for use in small satellites or that present questionable feasibility and are unlikely to justify the cost of a larger satellite scientific experiments with questionable underlying theory may also find themselves aboard cubesats as their low cost could justify riskier experiments biological research payloads have been flown on several missions with more planned 5 several missions to the moon and mars are planned to use cubesats 6 some cubesats became the first national satellites of their countries being launched by universities

external links history edit 1u cubesat structure the cubesat reference design was proposed in 1999 by professors jordi puig suari of california polytechnic state university and bob twiggs of stanford university 7 8 159 the goal was to enable graduate students to be able to design build test and operate in space a spacecraft with capabilities similar to that of the first spacecraft sputnik the cubesat as initially proposed did not set out to become a standard rather it became a standard over time by a process of emergence the first cubesats were launched in june 2003 on a russian eurockot and approximately 75 cubesats had been placed into orbit by 2012 9 the need for such a small factor satellite became apparent in 1998 as a result of work done at stanford space system development laboratory at ssdl students had been working on the opal orbiting picosatellite automatic launcher microsatellite since 1995 mission to deploy daughter ship picosatellites had resulted in the development of a launcher system that was hopelessly complicated and could only be made to work most of the time with the delays mounting twiggs sought out darpa funding that resulted in the redesign of the launching mechanism into a simple pusher plate concept with the satellites held in place by a spring loaded door 8 desiring to shorten the development cycle experienced on opal and inspired by the picosatellites opal carried twiggs set out to find how much could you reduce the size and still have a practical satellite the picosatellites on opal were a size that was not conducive to covering all sides of the spacecraft with solar cells inspired by a 4 inch cubic plastic box used to display beanie babies in stores 5 twiggs first settled on the larger 10 centimeter cube as a guideline for the new yet to be named cubesat concept a model of a launcher was developed for the new satellite using the same pusher plate concept that had been used in the modified opal launcher twiggs presented the idea to puig suari in the summer of 1999 and then at the japan u s science technology and space applications program justsap conference in november 1999 8 the term cubesat was coined to denote nanosatellites that adhere to the standards described in the cubesat design specification cal poly published the standard in an effort led by aerospace engineering professor jordi puig suari 10 bob twiggs of the department of aeronautics astronautics at stanford university and currently a member of the space science faculty at morehead state university in kentucky has contributed to the cubesat community 11 his efforts have focused on cubesats from educational institutions 12 the specification does not apply to other cube like nanosatellites such as the nasa mepsi nanosatellite which is slightly larger than a cubesat genesat 1 was first fully automated self contained biological spaceflight experiment on a satellite of its size it was also the first u s launched cubesat this work lead by john hines at nasa ames research was the catalyst for the entire nasa cubesat program 13 design edit the cubesat specification accomplishes several high level goals the main reason for miniaturizing satellites is to reduce the cost of deployment and are often suitable for launch in multiples using the excess capacity of larger launch vehicles the cubesat design specifically minimizes risk to the rest of the launch vehicle and payloads encapsulation of the payload interface takes away the amount of work that would previously be required for mating a piggyback satellite with its launcher unification among payloads and launchers enables quick exchanges of payloads and utilization of launch opportunities on short notice standard cubesats are made up of units designed to provide or 1 liter of useful volume while weighing no more than per unit the smallest standard size is 1u while 3u is the largest being composed of three units stacked lengthwise with an additional diameter cylinder centered on the long axis and extending beyond one face 2 the aerospace corporation has constructed and launched two smaller form cubesats of 0 5u for radiation measurement and technological demonstration 14 in recent years larger cubesat platforms have been proposed most commonly 6u or 15 and 12u or 15 to extend the capabilities of cubesats beyond academic and technology validation applications and into more complex science and national defense goals in 2014 two 6u perseus m cubesats were launched for maritime surveillance those two cubesats represent the largest cubesats flown as of 2015 the 2018 launch of the insight lander to mars will include two 6u cubesats called mars cube one marco 16 17 scientist holding a cubesat chassis since nearly all cubesats are regardless of length they can all be launched and deployed using a common deployment system called a poly picosatellite orbital deployer p pod developed and built by cal poly 18 no electronics form factors or communications protocols are specified or required by the cubesat design specification but cots hardware has consistently utilized certain features which many treat as standards in cubesat electronics most cots and custom designed electronics fit the form of pc 104 which was not designed for cubesats but presents a 90 profile that allows most of the volume to be occupied technically the pci 104 form is the variant of pc 104 used 19 and the actual pinout used does not reflect the pinout specified in the pci 104 standard stackthrough connectors on the boards allow for simple assembly and electrical interfacing and most manufacturers of cubesat electronics hardware hold to the same signal arrangement but some products do not so care must be taken to ensure consistent signal and power arrangements to prevent damage 20 care must be taken in electronics selection to ensure the devices can tolerate the radiation present for very low earth orbits leo in which atmospheric reentry would occur in just days or weeks radiation can largely be ignored and standard consumer grade electronics may be used consumer electronic devices can survive leo radiation for that time as the chance of a single event upset seu is very low spacecraft in a sustained low earth orbit lasting months or years are at risk and only fly hardware designed for and tested in irradiated environments missions beyond low earth orbit or which would remain in low earth orbit for many years must use radiation hardened devices 21 further considerations are made for operation in high vacuum due to the effects of sublimation outgassing and metal whiskers which may result in mission failure 22 different classifications are used to categorize such miniature satellites based on mass 23 1u cubesats belong to the genre of picosatellites minisatellite microsatellite nanosatellite picosatellite femtosatellite most cubesats carry one or two scientific instruments as their primary mission payload structure edit a skeletonized 1u structure with computer offered by pumpkin inc 24 the number of joined units classifies the size of cubesats and according to the cubesat design specification and are scalable along only one axis to fit the forms of 0 5u 1u 1 5u 2u or 3u all the standard sizes of cubesat have been built and launched and represent the form factors for nearly all launched cubesats as of 2015 25 materials used in the structure must feature the same coefficient of thermal expansion as the deployer to prevent jamming specifically allowed materials are four aluminum alloys 7075 6061 5005 and 5052 aluminum used on the structure which contacts the p pod must be anodized to prevent cold welding and other materials may be used for the structure if a waiver is obtained 2 beyond cold welding further consideration is put into material selection as not all materials can be used in vacuums structures often feature soft dampers at each end typically made of rubber to lessen the effects of impacting other cubesats in the p pod protrusions beyond the maximum dimensions are allowed by the standard specification to a maximum of beyond each side any protrusions may not interfere with the deployment rails and are typically occupied by antennas and solar panels in revision 13 of the cubesat design specification an extra available volume was defined for use on 3u projects the additional volume is made possible by space typically wasted in the p pod mk spring mechanism 3u cubesats which utilize the space are designated 3u and may place components in a cylindrical volume centered on one end of the cubesat the cylindrical space has a maximum diameter of and a height no greater than while not allowing for any increase in mass beyond the maximum of propulsion systems and antennas are the most common components that might require the additional volume though the payload sometimes extends into this volume deviations from the dimension and mass requirements can be waived following application and negotiation with the launch service provider 2 cubesat structures do not have all the same strength concerns as larger satellites do as they have the added benefit of the deployer supporting them structurally during launch still some cubesats will undergo vibration analysis or structural analysis to ensure that components unsupported by the p pod remain structurally sound throughout the launch 26 despite rarely undergoing the analysis that larger satellites do cubesats rarely fail due to mechanical issues 27 computing edit like larger satellites cubesats often feature multiple computers handling different tasks in parallel including the attitude control power management payload operation and primary control tasks cots attitude control systems typically include their own computer as do the power management systems payloads must be able to interface with the primary computer to be useful which sometimes requires the use of another small computer this may be due to limitations in the primary ability to control the payload with limited communication protocols to prevent overloading the primary computer with raw data handling or to ensure operation continues uninterrupted by the other computing needs such as communication still the primary computer may be used for payload related tasks which might include image processing data analysis and data compression tasks which the primary computer typically handles include the delegation of tasks to the other computers attitude control calculations for orbital maneuvers scheduling and activation of active thermal control components cubesat computers are highly susceptible to radiation and builders will take special steps to ensure proper operation in the high radiation of space such as the use of the ecc ram some satellites may incorporate redundancy by implementing multiple primary computers this could be done on valuable missions to lessen the risk of mission failure consumer smartphones have been used for computing in some cubesats such as phonesats attitude control edit near earth asteroid scout concept a controllable solar sail cubesat attitude control for cubesats relies on miniaturizing technology without significant performance degradation tumbling typically occurs as soon as a cubesat is deployed due to asymmetric deployment forces and bumping with other cubesats some cubesats operate normally while tumbling but those that require pointing in a certain direction or cannot operate safely while spinning must be detumbled systems that perform attitude determination and control include reaction wheels magnetorquers thrusters star trackers sun sensors earth sensors angular rate sensors and gps receivers and antennas combinations of these systems are typically seen in order to take each advantages and mitigate their shortcomings reaction wheels are commonly utilized for their ability to impart relatively large moments for any given energy input but reaction utility is limited due to saturation the point at which a wheel cannot spin faster examples of cubesat reaction wheels include the maryland aerospace mai 101 28 and the sinclair interplanetary rw 0 03 4 29 reaction wheels can be desaturated with the use of thrusters or magnetorquers thrusters can provide large moments by imparting a couple on the spacecraft but inefficiencies in small propulsion systems cause thrusters to run out of fuel rapidly commonly found on nearly all cubesats are magnetorquers which run electricity through a solenoid to take advantage of magnetic field to produce a turning moment attitude control modules and solar panels typically feature built in magnetorquers for cubesats that only need to detumble no attitude determination method beyond an angular rate sensor or electronic gyroscope is necessary pointing in a specific direction is necessary for earth observation orbital maneuvers maximizing solar power and some scientific instruments directional pointing accuracy can be achieved by sensing earth and its horizon the sun or specific stars sinclair ss 411 sun sensor 30 and st 16 star tracker 31 both have applications for cubesats and have flight heritage colony i bus uses an aerodynamic wing for passive attitude stabilization 32 determination of a location can be done through the use of on board gps which is relatively expensive for a cubesat or by relaying radar tracking data to the craft from earth based tracking systems propulsion edit cubesat propulsion has made rapid advancements in the following technologies cold gas chemical propulsion electric propulsion and solar sails the biggest challenge with cubesat propulsion is preventing risk to the launch vehicle and its primary payload while still providing significant capability 33 components and methods that are commonly used in larger satellites are disallowed or limited and the cubesat design specification cds requires a waiver for pressurization above 1.2 standard atmospheres over 100 wh of stored chemical energy and hazardous materials 2 those restrictions pose great challenges for cubesat propulsion systems as typical space propulsion systems utilize combinations of high pressures high energy densities and hazardous materials beyond the restrictions set forth by launch service providers various technical challenges further reduce the usefulness of cubesat propulsion gimbaled thrust cannot be used in small engines due to the complexity of gimbaling mechanisms thrust vectoring must instead be achieved by thrusting asymmetrically in multiple nozzle propulsion systems or by changing the center of mass relative to the geometry with actuated components 34 small motors may also not have room for throttling methods that allow smaller than fully on thrust which is important for precision maneuvers such as rendezvous 35 cubesats which require longer life also benefit from propulsion systems when used for orbit keeping a propulsion system can slow orbital decay cold gas thrusters edit a cold gas thruster typically stores inert gas such as nitrogen in a pressurized tank and releases the gas through a nozzle to produce thrust operation is handled by just a single valve in most systems which makes cold gas the simplest useful propulsion technology 36 cold gas propulsion systems can be very safe since the gases used do not have to be volatile or corrosive though some systems opt to feature dangerous gases such as sulfur dioxide 37 this ability to use inert gases is highly advantageous to cubesats as they are usually restricted from hazardous materials unfortunately only low performance can be achieved with them 36 preventing high impulse maneuvers even in low mass cubesats due to this low performance their use in cubesats for main propulsion is limited and designers choose higher efficiency systems with only minor increases in complexity cold gas systems more often see use in cubesat attitude control chemical propulsion edit chemical propulsion systems use a chemical reaction to produce a high pressure high temperature gas that accelerates out of a nozzle chemical propellant can be liquid solid or a hybrid of both liquid propellants can be a monopropellant passed through a catalyst or bipropellant which combusts an oxidizer and a fuel the benefits of monopropellants are relatively low complexity high thrust output low power requirements and high reliability monopropellant motors tend to have high thrust while remaining comparatively simple which also provides high reliability these motors are practical for cubesats due to their low power requirements and because their simplicity allows them to be very small small hydrazine fueled motors have been developed 38 but may require a waiver to fly due to restrictions on hazardous chemicals set forth in the cubesat design specification 2 safer chemical propellants which would not require hazardous chemical waivers are being developed such as af m315 hydroxylammonium nitrate for which motors are being or have been designed 38 39 a water electrolysis thruster is technically a chemical propulsion system as it burns hydrogen and oxygen which it generates by on orbit electrolysis of water 40 electric propulsion edit bit 3 ion thruster proposed for lunar icecube mission cubesat electric propulsion typically uses electric energy to accelerate propellant to high speed which results in high specific impulse many of these technologies can be made small enough for use in nanosatellites and several methods are in development types of electric propulsion currently being designed for use in cubesats include hall effect thrusters 41 ion thrusters 42 pulsed plasma thrusters 43 electrospray thrusters 44 and resistojets 45 several notable cubesat missions plan to use electric propulsion such as lunar icecube 46 the high efficiency associated with electric propulsion could allow cubesats to propel themselves to mars 47 electric propulsion systems are disadvantaged in their use of power which requires the cubesat to have larger solar cells more complicated power distribution and often larger batteries furthermore many electric propulsion methods may still require pressurized tanks to store propellant which is restricted by the cubesat design specification the estcube 1 used an electric solar wind sail which is nothing like a solar sail despite its name this technology used an electric field to deflect protons from solar wind to produce thrust it is similar to an electrodynamic tether in that the craft only needs to supply electricity to operate solar sail edit solar sails also sails are a form the radiation pressure also called solar pressure from stars to push large ultra thin mirrors to high speeds requiring no propellant force from a solar sail scales with the area this makes sails well suited for use in cubesats as their small mass results in the greater acceleration for a given solar area however solar sails still need to be quite large compared to the satellite which means useful solar sails must be deployed adding mechanical complexity and a potential source of failure this propulsion method is the only one not plagued with restrictions set by the cubesat design specification as it does not require high pressures hazardous materials or significant chemical energy few cubesats have employed a solar sail as its main propulsion and stability in deep space including the 3u nanosail d2 launched in 2010 and the lightsail 1 in may 2015 lightsail 2 is scheduled for launch in march 2017 48 while at least two cubesats that plan to launch on the space launch system s first flight in september 2018 are set to use solar sails the proposed near earth asteroid scout nea scout 49 and the lunar flashlight power edit winglet solar panels increase surface area for power generation cubesats use solar cells to convert solar light to electricity that is then stored in rechargeable lithium ion batteries that provide power during eclipse as well as during peak load times 50 these satellites have a limited surface area on their external walls for solar cells assembly and has to be effectively shared with other parts such as antennas optical sensors camera lens propulsion systems and access port lithium ion batteries feature high energy to mass ratios making them well suited to use on mass restricted spacecraft battery charging and discharging is typically handled by a dedicated electrical power system eps batteries sometimes feature heaters 51 to prevent the battery from reaching dangerously low temperatures which might cause battery and mission failure 52 missions with higher power requirements can make use of attitude control to ensure the solar panels remain in their most effective orientation toward the sun and further power needs can be met through the addition and orientation of deployed solar arrays recent innovations include additional spring loaded solar arrays that deploy as soon as the satellite is released as well as arrays that feature thermal knife mechanisms that would deploy the panels when commanded cubesats may not be powered between launch and deployment and must feature a remove before flight pin which cuts all power to prevent operation during loading into the p pod additionally a deployment switch is actuated while the craft is loaded into a p pod cutting power to the spacecraft and is deactivated after exiting the p pod 2 telecommunications edit deployable high gain mesh reflector antenna operating at ka band for the radar in a cubesat raincube the low cost of cubesats has enabled unprecedented access to space for smaller institutions and organizations but for most cubesat forms the range and available power is limited to about 2w for its communications antennae 23 53 they can use radio communication systems in the vhf uhf l s c and x band 23 for uhf vhf transmissions a single helical antenna or four monopole antennae are deployed by a spring loaded mechanism 23 53 because of tumbling and low power range radio communications are a challenge many cubesats use an omnidirectional monopole or dipole antenna built with commercial measuring tape for more demanding needs some companies offer high gain antennae for cubesats but their deployment and pointing systems are significantly more complex 23 53 for example mit and jpl are developing an inflatable dish antenna with a useful range to the moon but appears to be poorly efficient 54 jpl has successfully developed x band and ka band high gain antennas for marco 55 56 and radar in a cubesat raincube missions 56 57 58 antennas edit traditionally low earth orbit cubesats use antennas for communication purpose at uhf and s band to venture farther in the solar system larger antennas compatible with the deep space network x band and ka band are required jpl s engineers developed several deployable high gain antennas compatible with 6u class cubesats for marco 55 59 and nea scout 60 jpl s engineers have also developed a 0 5m mesh reflector antenna operating at ka band and compatible with the dsn 55 59 61 that folds in a 1 5u stowage volume for marco jpl s antenna engineers designed a folded panel reflectarray fpr 62 to fit on a 6u cubesat bus and supports x band mars to earth telecommunications at 8kbit s at 1au thermal management edit different cubesat components possess different acceptable temperature ranges beyond which they may become temporarily or permanently inoperable satellites in orbit are heated by radiative heat emitted from the sun directly and reflected off earth as well as heat generated by the components cubesats must also cool by radiating heat either into space or into the cooler surface if it is cooler than the spacecraft all of these radiative heat sources and sinks are rather constant and very predictable so long as the orbit and eclipse time are known components used to ensure the temperature requirements are met in cubesats include multi layer insulation and heaters for the battery other spacecraft thermal control techniques in small satellites include specific component placement based on expected thermal output of those components and rarely deployed thermal devices such as louvers analysis and simulation of the thermal model is an important determining factor in applying thermal management components and techniques cubesats with special thermal concerns often associated with certain deployment mechanisms and payloads may be tested in a thermal vacuum chamber before launch such testing provides a larger degree of assurance than full sized satellites can receive since cubesats are small enough to fit inside of a thermal vacuum chamber in their entirety temperature sensors are typically placed on different cubesat components so that action may be taken to avoid dangerous temperature ranges such as reorienting the craft in order to avoid or introduce direct thermal radiation to a specific part thereby allowing it to cool or heat costs edit cubesat forms a cost effective independent means of getting a payload into orbit 10 after delays from low cost launchers such as interorbital systems 63 launch prices have been about $100,000 per unit 64 65 but newer operators are offering lower pricing 66 some cubesats have complicated components or instruments such as lightsail 1 that pushes their construction cost into the millions 67 but a basic 1u cubesat can cost about $50,000 to construct 68 so cubesats are a viable option for some schools and universities as well as small businesses to develop cubesats for commercial purposes notable past missions edit main article list of cubesats nanoracks cubesats being launched from the nanoracks

$6.9 million to rocket lab electron rocket $5.5 million to firefly space systems alpha rocket and $4.7 million to virgin galactic launcherone rocket 111 the payloads for the three flights under the vcls contract have not yet been assigned 111 other small satellite launch systems are under development that would carry cubesats alongside a small payload including the neptune series of rockets by interorbital systems garvey spacecraft s nanosat launch vehicle 112 and the spark rocket in addition to conventional launch vehicles and launch facilitators like ksf space several air launch to orbit vehicles are in the works by swiss space systems generation orbit launch services and boeing in the form of their small launch vehicle as of december 2015 only one launch vehicle that emphasizes small cubesat payloads has made a launch attempt the spark broke up shortly after launch on 4 november 2015 the rocket was carrying 12 cubesats of various sizes along with its 55 kilogram primary payload 113 rocket lab s cubesats are planned to be launched from new zealand 114 deployment edit csswe next to its p pod before integration and launch p pods were designed with cubesats to provide a common platform for secondary payloads p pods are mounted to a launch vehicle and carry cubesats into orbit and deploy them once the proper signal is received from the launch vehicle the p pod mk iii has capacity for three 1u cubesats or other 0 5u 1u 1 5u 2u or 3u cubesats combination up to a maximum volume of 3u 115 other cubesat deployers exist with the nanoracks cubesat deployer nrcsd on the international space station being the most popular method of cubesat deployment as of 2014 3 some cubesat deployers are created by companies such as the isipod innovative solutions in space bv or spl astro und feinwerktechnik adlershof gmbh while some have been created by governments or other non profit institutions such as the x pod university of toronto t pod university of tokyo or the j ssod jaxa on the international space station 116 while the p pod is limited to launching a 3u cubesat at most the nrcsd can launch a 6u cubesat and the isipod can launch a different form of 6u cubesat while nearly all cubesats are deployed from a launch vehicle or the international space station some are deployed by the primary payloads themselves for example fastsat deployed the nanosail d2 a 3u cubesat this was done again with the cygnus mass simulator as the primary payload launched on the maiden flight of the antares rocket carrying and later deploying four cubesats for cubesat applications beyond orbit the method of deploying the satellites from the primary payload will also be adopted eleven cubesats are planned to be launched on the space launch system s exploration mission 1 which would place them in the vicinity of the moon insight a planned mars lander will also bring cubesats beyond earth orbit to use them as relay communications satellites known as marco a and b they would be the first cubesats sent beyond the system chasqui i saw a unique deployment process when it was deployed by hand during a spacewalk on the international space station in 2014 see

adopted by universities companies and government agencies around the world they simply wanted to design a spacecraft with capabilities similar to sputnik that graduate student could design build test
