risk of a broken bone 3 it is the most common reason for a broken bone among the elderly 3 bones that commonly break include the vertebrae in the spine the bones of the forearm and the hip 8 until a broken bone occurs there are typically no symptoms 3 bones may weaken to such a degree that a break may occur with minor stress or spontaneously 3 chronic pain and a decreased ability to carry out normal activities may occur following a broken bone 3 osteoporosis may be due to lower than normal bone mass and greater than normal bone loss 3 bone loss increases after menopause due to lower levels of estrogen 3 osteoporosis may also occur due to a number of diseases or treatments including alcoholism anorexia hyperthyroidism kidney disease and surgical removal of the ovaries 3 certain medications increase the rate of bone loss including some antiseizure medications chemotherapy proton pump inhibitors selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and glucocorticosteroids 3 not enough exercise and smoking are also risk factors 3 osteoporosis is defined as a bone density of 2.5 standard deviations below that of a young adult 4 this is typically measured by dual energy x ray absorptiometry at the hip 4 prevention of osteoporosis includes a proper diet during childhood and efforts to avoid medications that cause the condition 3 efforts to prevent broken bones in those with osteoporosis include a good diet exercise and fall prevention 3 lifestyle changes such as stopping smoking and not drinking alcohol may help 3 biphosphonate medications are useful in those with previous broken bones due to osteoporosis 5 6 in those with osteoporosis but no previous broken bones they are less effective 5 6 9 a number of other medications may also be useful 3 10 osteoporosis becomes more common with age 3 about 15% of white people in their 50s and 70% of those over 80 are affected 7 it is more common in women than men 3 in the developed world depending on the method of diagnosis 2% to 8% of males and 9% to 38% of females are affected 11 rates of disease in the developing world are unclear 12 about 22 million women and 5.5 million men in the european union had osteoporosis in 2010 13 in the united states in 2010 about eight million women and one to two million men had osteoporosis 11 14 white and asian people are at greater risk 3 the word osteoporosis is from the greek terms for porous bones 15 contents 1 signs and symptoms 1.1 fractures 1.2 falls risk 2 risk factors 2.1 nonmodifiable 2.2 potentially modifiable 2.3 medical disorders 2.4 medication 2.5

symptoms edit osteoporosis is an age related disorder that causes the gradual loss of bone density and strength when the thoracic vertebrae are affected there can be a gradual collapse of the vertebrae this results in kyphosis an excessive curvature of the thoracic region illustration depicting normal standing posture and osteoporosis osteoporosis itself has no symptoms its main consequence is the increased risk of bone fractures osteoporotic fractures occur in situations where healthy people would not normally break a bone they are therefore regarded as fragility fractures typical fragility fractures occur in the vertebral column rib hip and wrist fractures edit fractures are the most dangerous aspect of osteoporosis debilitating acute and chronic pain in the elderly is often attributed to fractures from osteoporosis and can lead to further disability and early mortality 16 these fractures may also be asymptomatic the most common osteoporotic fractures are of the wrist spine shoulder and hip the symptoms of a vertebral collapse compression fracture are sudden back pain often with radicular pain shooting pain due to nerve root compression and rarely with spinal cord compression or cauda equina syndrome multiple vertebral fractures lead to a stooped posture loss of height and chronic pain with resultant reduction in mobility 17 fractures of the long bones acutely impair mobility and may require surgery hip fracture in particular usually requires prompt surgery as serious risks are associated with it such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and increased mortality fracture risk calculators assess the risk of fracture based upon several criteria including bmd age smoking alcohol usage weight and gender recognized calculators include frax 18 and dubbo the term established osteoporosis is used when a broken bone due to osteoporosis has occurred 19 osteoporosis is a part of frailty syndrome falls risk edit the increased risk of falling associated with aging leads to fractures of the wrist spine and hip the risk of falling in turn is increased by impaired eyesight due to any cause e g glaucoma macular degeneration balance disorder movement disorders e g disease dementia and sarcopenia age related loss of skeletal muscle collapse transient loss of postural tone with or without loss of consciousness leads to a significant risk of falls causes of syncope are manifold but may include cardiac arrhythmias irregular heart beat vasovagal syncope orthostatic hypotension abnormal drop in blood pressure on standing up and seizures removal of obstacles and loose carpets in the living environment may substantially reduce falls those with previous falls as well as those with gait or balance disorders are most at risk 20 risk factors edit risk factors for osteoporotic fracture can be split between nonmodifiable and potentially modifiable in addition osteoporosis is a recognized complication of specific diseases and disorders medication use is theoretically modifiable although in many cases the use of medication that increases osteoporosis risk may be unavoidable caffeine is not a risk factor for osteoporosis 21 it is more likely in females than males 3 nonmodifiable edit bone density peaks at about 30 years of age women lose bone mass more rapidly than men 22 the most important risk factors for osteoporosis are advanced age in both men and women and female sex estrogen deficiency following menopause or surgical removal of the ovaries is correlated with a rapid reduction in bone mineral density while in men a decrease in testosterone levels has a comparable but less pronounced effect 23 24 race while osteoporosis occurs in people from all ethnic groups european or asian ancestry predisposes for osteoporosis 25 heredity those with a family history of fracture or osteoporosis are at an increased risk the heritability of the fracture as well as low bone mineral density is relatively high ranging from 25 to 80 at least 30 genes are associated with the development of osteoporosis 26 those who have already had a fracture are at least twice as likely to have another fracture compared to someone of the same age and sex 27 early menopause hysterectomy is another predisposing factor build a small stature is also a nonmodifiable risk factor associated with the development of osteoporosis 28 potentially modifiable edit excess consumption of alcohol although small amounts of alcohol are probably beneficial bone density increases with increasing alcohol intake chronic heavy drinking alcohol intake greater than three units day probably increases fracture risk despite any beneficial effects on bone density 29 30 vitamin d deficiency 31 32 low circulating vitamin d is common among the elderly worldwide 4 mild vitamin d insufficiency is associated with increased parathyroid hormone pth production 4 pth increases bone resorption leading to bone loss a positive association exists between serum 1 25 dihydroxycholecalciferol levels and bone mineral density while pth is negatively associated with bone mineral density 4 tobacco smoking many studies have associated smoking with decreased bone health but the mechanisms are unclear tobacco smoking has been proposed to inhibit the activity of osteoblasts and is an independent risk factor for osteoporosis 29 33 smoking also results in increased breakdown of exogenous estrogen lower body weight and earlier menopause all of which contribute to lower bone mineral density 4 malnutrition nutrition has an important and complex role in maintenance of good bone identified risk factors include low dietary calcium and or phosphorus magnesium zinc boron iron fluoride copper vitamins a k e and c and d where skin exposure to sunlight provides an inadequate supply excess sodium is a risk factor high blood acidity may be diet related and is a known antagonist of bone 34 some have identified low protein intake as associated with lower peak bone mass during adolescence and lower bone mineral density in elderly populations 4 conversely some have identified low protein intake as a positive factor protein is among the causes of dietary acidity imbalance of omega 6 to omega 3 polyunsaturated fats is yet another identified risk factor 35 high dietary protein from animal sources research has found an association between diets high in animal protein and increased urinary calcium 36 37 38 and have been linked to an increase in fractures 39 however the relevance of this observation to bone density is unclear citation needed since higher protein diets tend to increase absorption of calcium from the diet and are associated with higher bone density 40 indeed it has recently been argued that low protein diets cause poor bone health 41 no interventional trials have been performed on dietary protein in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis 42 underweight inactive bone remodeling occurs in response to physical stress so physical inactivity can lead to significant bone loss 4 weight bearing exercise can increase peak bone mass achieved in adolescence 4 and a highly significant correlation between bone strength and muscle strength has been determined 43 the incidence of osteoporosis is lower in overweight people 44 endurance training in female endurance athletes large volumes of training can lead to decreased bone density and an increased risk of osteoporosis 45 this effect might be caused by intense training suppressing menstruation producing amenorrhea and it is part of the female athlete triad 46 however for male athletes the situation is less clear and although some studies have reported low bone density in elite male endurance athletes 47 others have instead seen increased leg bone density 48 49 heavy metals a strong association between cadmium and lead with bone disease has been established low level exposure to cadmium is associated with an increased loss of bone mineral density readily in both genders leading to pain and increased risk of fractures especially in the elderly and in females higher cadmium exposure results in osteomalacia softening of the bone 50 soft drinks some studies indicate soft drinks many of which contain phosphoric acid may increase risk of osteoporosis at least in women 51 others suggest soft drinks may displace calcium containing drinks from the diet rather than directly causing osteoporosis 52 proton pump inhibitors such as lansoprazole esomeprazole or omeprazole that decrease stomach acid are a risk for bone fractures if taken for two or more years due to decreased absorption of calcium in the stomach 53 medical disorders edit the body regulates calcium homeostasis with two pathways one is signaled to turn on when blood calcium levels drop below normal and one is the pathway that is signaled to turn on when blood calcium levels are elevated many diseases and disorders have been associated with osteoporosis 54 for some the underlying mechanism influencing the bone metabolism is straightforward whereas for others the causes are multiple or unknown in general immobilization causes bone loss following the use it or lose it rule for example localized osteoporosis can occur after prolonged immobilization of a fractured limb in a cast this is also more common in active people with a high bone turn over for example athletes other examples include bone loss during space flight or in people who are bedridden or use wheelchairs for various reasons hypogonadal states can cause secondary osteoporosis these include turner syndrome klinefelter syndrome kallmann syndrome anorexia nervosa andropause 55 hypothalamic amenorrhea or hyperprolactinemia 55 in females the effect of hypogonadism is mediated by estrogen deficiency it can appear as early menopause 45 years or from prolonged premenopausal amenorrhea 1 year bilateral oophorectomy surgical removal of the ovaries and premature ovarian failure cause deficient estrogen production in males testosterone deficiency is the cause for example andropause or after surgical removal of the testes endocrine disorders that can induce bone loss include syndrome 4 hyperparathyroidism 4 hyperthyroidism 4 hypothyroidism diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2 56 acromegaly and adrenal insufficiency 54 malnutrition parenteral nutrition 4 and malabsorption can lead to osteoporosis nutritional and gastrointestinal disorders that can predispose to osteoporosis include undiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease both symptomatic and asymptomatic people 4 57 disease 58 ulcerative colitis 58 cystic fibrosis 58 surgery 55 after gastrectomy intestinal bypass surgery or bowel resection and severe liver disease especially primary biliary cirrhosis 55 people with lactose intolerance or milk allergy may develop osteoporosis due to restrictions of calcium containing foods 59 individuals with bulimia can also develop osteoporosis those with an otherwise adequate calcium intake can develop osteoporosis due to the inability to absorb calcium and or vitamin d other micronutrients such as vitamin k or vitamin b 12 deficiency may also contribute people with rheumatologic disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis 55 ankylosing spondylitis 55 systemic lupus erythematosus and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis are at increased risk of osteoporosis either as part of their disease or because of other risk factors notably corticosteroid therapy systemic diseases such as amyloidosis and sarcoidosis can also lead to osteoporosis renal insufficiency can lead to renal osteodystrophy hematologic disorders linked to osteoporosis are multiple myeloma 55 and other monoclonal gammopathies 56 lymphoma leukemia mastocytosis 55 hemophilia sickle cell disease and thalassemia several inherited disorders have been linked to osteoporosis these include osteogenesis imperfecta 55 marfan syndrome 55 hemochromatosis 4 hypophosphatasia 60 for which it is often misdiagnosed 61 glycogen storage diseases homocystinuria 55 syndrome 55 porphyria menkes syndrome epidermolysis bullosa and disease people with scoliosis of unknown cause also have a higher risk of osteoporosis bone loss can be a feature of complex regional pain syndrome it is also more frequent in people with disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease people with disease have a higher risk of broken bones this is related to poor balance and poor bone density 62 in disease there may be a link between the loss of dopaminergic neurons and altered calcium metabolism 63 and iron metabolism causing a stiffening of the skeleton and kyphosis medication edit certain medications have been associated with an increase in osteoporosis risk only glucocorticosteroids and anticonvulsants are classically associated but evidence is emerging with regard to other drugs steroid induced osteoporosis siop arises due to use of analogous to syndrome and involving mainly the axial skeleton the synthetic glucocorticoid prescription drug prednisone is a main candidate after prolonged intake some professional guidelines recommend prophylaxis in patients who take the equivalent of more than hydrocortisone of prednisolone especially when this is in excess of three months 64 alternate day use may not prevent this complication 65 barbiturates phenytoin and some other enzyme inducing antiepileptics these probably accelerate the metabolism of vitamin d 66 l thyroxine over replacement may contribute to osteoporosis in a similar fashion as thyrotoxicosis does 54 this can be relevant in subclinical hypothyroidism several drugs induce hypogonadism for example aromatase inhibitors used in breast cancer methotrexate and other antimetabolite drugs depot progesterone and gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists anticoagulants long term use of heparin is associated with a decrease in bone density 67 and warfarin and related coumarins have been linked with an increased risk in osteoporotic fracture in long term use 68 proton pump inhibitors these drugs inhibit the production of stomach acid this is thought to interfere with calcium absorption 69 chronic phosphate binding may also occur with aluminium containing antacids 54 thiazolidinediones used for diabetes rosiglitazone and possibly pioglitazone inhibitors of have been linked with an increased risk of osteoporosis and fracture 70 chronic lithium therapy has been associated with osteoporosis 54 evolutionary edit age related bone loss is common among humans due to exhibiting less dense bones than other primate species 71 because of the more porous bones of humans frequency of severe osteoporosis and osteoporosis related fractures is higher 72 the human vulnerability to osteoporosis is an obvious cost but it can be justified by the advantage of bipedalism inferring that this vulnerability is the byproduct of such 72 it has been suggested that porous bones help to absorb the increased stress that we have on two surfaces compared to our primate counterparts who have four surfaces to disperse the force 71 in addition the porosity allows for more flexibility and a lighter skeleton that is easier to support 72 one other consideration may be that diets today have much lower amounts of calcium than the diets of other primates or the tetrapedal ancestors to humans which may lead to higher likelihood to show signs of osteoporosis 73 pathogenesis edit osteoporosis locations light micrograph of an osteoclast displaying typical distinguishing characteristics a large cell with multiple nuclei and a foamy cytosol light micrograph of osteoblasts several displaying a prominent golgi apparatus actively synthesizing osteoid containing two osteocytes the underlying mechanism in all cases of osteoporosis is an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation in normal bone matrix remodeling of bone is constant up to 10% of all bone mass may be undergoing remodeling at any point in time the process takes place in bone multicellular units bmus as first described by frost thomas in 1963 74 osteoclasts are assisted by transcription factor pu 1 to degrade the bone matrix while osteoblasts rebuild the bone matrix low bone mass density can then occur when osteoclasts are degrading the bone matrix faster than the osteoblasts are rebuilding the bone 75 the three main mechanisms by which osteoporosis develops are an inadequate peak bone mass the skeleton develops insufficient mass and strength during growth excessive bone resorption and inadequate formation of new bone during remodeling likely due to msc biasing away from the osteoblast and toward the marrow adipocyte lineage 76 an interplay of these three mechanisms underlies the development of fragile bone tissue 26 hormonal factors strongly determine the rate of bone resorption lack of estrogen e g as a result of menopause increases bone resorption as well as decreasing the deposition of new bone that normally takes place in weight bearing bones the amount of estrogen needed to suppress this process is lower than that normally needed to stimulate the uterus and breast gland the of the estrogen receptor appears to be the most important in regulating bone turnover 26 in addition to estrogen calcium metabolism plays a significant role in bone turnover and deficiency of calcium and vitamin d leads to impaired bone deposition in addition the parathyroid glands react to low calcium levels by secreting parathyroid hormone parathormone pth which increases bone resorption to ensure sufficient calcium in the blood the role of calcitonin a hormone generated by the thyroid that increases bone deposition is less clear and probably not as significant as that of pth 26 the activation of osteoclasts is regulated by various molecular signals of which rankl receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa b ligand is one of the best studied this molecule is produced by osteoblasts and other cells e g lymphocytes and stimulates rank receptor activator of nuclear factor osteoprotegerin opg binds rankl before it has an opportunity to bind to rank and hence suppresses its ability to increase bone resorption rankl rank and opg are closely related to tumor necrosis factor and its receptors the role of the wnt signaling pathway is recognized but less well understood local production of eicosanoids and interleukins is thought to participate in the regulation of bone turnover and excess or reduced production of these mediators may underlie the development of osteoporosis 26 trabecular bone or cancellous bone is the sponge like bone in the ends of long bones and vertebrae cortical bone is the hard outer shell of bones and the middle of long bones because osteoblasts and osteoclasts inhabit the surface of bones trabecular bone is more active and is more subject to bone turnover and remodeling not only is bone density decreased but the microarchitecture of bone is also disrupted the weaker spicules of trabecular bone break microcracks and are replaced by weaker bone common osteoporotic fracture sites the wrist the hip and the spine have a relatively high trabecular bone to cortical bone ratio these areas rely on the trabecular bone for strength so the intense remodeling causes these areas to degenerate most when the remodeling is imbalanced citation needed around the ages of cancellous or trabecular bone loss begins women may lose as much as 50 while men lose about 30 28 diagnosis edit multiple osteoporotic wedge fractures demonstrated on a lateral thoraco lumbar spine x ray the diagnosis of osteoporosis can be made using conventional radiography and by measuring the bone mineral density bmd 77 the most popular method of measuring bmd is dual energy x ray absorptiometry in addition to the detection of abnormal bmd the diagnosis of osteoporosis requires investigations into potentially modifiable underlying causes this may be done with blood tests depending on the likelihood of an underlying problem investigations for cancer with metastasis to the bone multiple myeloma disease and other above mentioned causes may be performed conventional radiography edit conventional radiography is useful both by itself and in conjunction with ct or mri for detecting complications of osteopenia reduced bone mass pre osteoporosis such as fractures for differential diagnosis of osteopenia or for follow up examinations in specific clinical settings such as soft tissue calcifications secondary hyperparathyroidism or osteomalacia in renal osteodystrophy however radiography is relatively insensitive to detection of early disease and requires a substantial amount of bone loss about 30 to be apparent on x ray images the main radiographic features of generalized osteoporosis are cortical thinning and increased radiolucency frequent complications of osteoporosis are vertebral fractures for which spinal radiography can help considerably in diagnosis and follow up vertebral height measurements can objectively be made using plain film x rays by using several methods such as height loss together with area reduction particularly when looking at vertical deformity in t4 l4 or by determining a spinal fracture index that takes into account the number of vertebrae involved involvement of multiple vertebral bodies leads to kyphosis of the thoracic spine leading to what is known as hump dual energy x ray edit dual energy x ray absorptiometry dexa scan is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis osteoporosis is diagnosed when the bone mineral density is less than or equal to 2.5 standard deviations below that of a young 4 58 healthy adult women reference population this is translated as a t score but because bone density decreases with age more people become osteoporotic with increasing age 4 58 the world health organization has established the following diagnostic guidelines 4 19 category t score range young women normal t score 85% osteopenia t score 14% osteoporosis t score 0.6% severe osteoporosis t score with fragility fracture 19 the international society for clinical densitometry takes the position that a diagnosis of osteoporosis in men under 50 years of age should not be made on the basis of densitometric criteria alone it also states for premenopausal women z scores comparison with age group rather than peak bone mass rather than t scores should be used and the diagnosis of osteoporosis in such women also should not be made on the basis of densitometric criteria alone 78 biomarkers edit chemical biomarkers are a useful tool in detecting bone degradation the enzyme cathepsin k breaks down type i collagen protein an important constituent in bones prepared antibodies can recognize the resulting fragment called a neoepitope as a way to diagnose osteoporosis 79 increased urinary excretion of c telopeptides a type i collagen breakdown product also serves as a biomarker for osteoporosis 80 comparison of bone pathology view talk edit condition calcium phosphate alkaline phosphatase parathyroid hormone comments osteopenia unaffected unaffected normal unaffected

soft bones osteitis fibrosa cystica elevated decreased elevated elevated brown tumors disease of bone unaffected unaffected variable depending on stage of disease unaffected abnormal bone architecture other measuring tools edit quantitative computed tomography differs from dxa in that it gives separate estimates of bmd for trabecular and cortical bone and reports precise volumetric mineral density in mg cm 3 rather than relative z score among advantages it can be performed at axial and peripheral sites can be calculated from existing ct scans without a separate radiation dose is sensitive to change over time can analyze a region of any size or shape excludes irrelevant tissue such as fat muscle and air and does not require knowledge of the subpopulation in order to create a clinical score e g the z score of all females of a certain age among disadvantages it requires a high radiation dose compared to dxa ct scanners are large and expensive and because its practice has been less standardized than bmd its results are more operator dependent peripheral qct has been introduced to improve upon the limitations of dxa and qct 77 quantitative ultrasound has many advantages in assessing osteoporosis the modality is small no ionizing radiation is involved measurements can be made quickly and easily and the cost of the device is low compared with dxa and qct devices the calcaneus is the most common skeletal site for quantitative ultrasound assessment because it has a high percentage of trabecular bone that is replaced more often than cortical bone providing early evidence of metabolic change also the calcaneus is fairly flat and parallel reducing repositioning errors the method can be applied to children neonates and preterm infants just as well as to adults 77 some ultrasound devices can be used on the tibia 81 screening edit the u s preventive services task force uspstf recommend that all women of age or older be screened by bone densitometry 82 additionally they recommend screening women with increased risk factors that puts them at risk equivalent to a 82 there is insufficient evidence to make recommendations about the intervals for repeated screening and the appropriate age to stop screening 82 in men the harm versus benefit of screening for osteoporosis is unknown 82 prescrire states that the need to test for osteoporosis in those who have not had a previous bone fracture is unclear 83 the international society for clinical densitometry however suggest bmd testing for men 70 or older or those who are indicated for risk equal to that of a 84 a number of tools exist to help determine who is reasonable to test 85 prevention edit lifestyle prevention of osteoporosis is in many aspects the inverse of the potentially modifiable risk factors 86 as tobacco smoking and high alcohol intake have been linked with osteoporosis smoking cessation and moderation of alcohol intake are commonly recommended as ways to help prevent it 87 in people with coeliac disease adherence to a gluten free diet decreases the risk of developing osteoporosis 88 and increases bone density 57 the diet must ensure optimal calcium intake of at least one gram daily and measuring vitamin d levels is recommended and to take specific supplements if necessary 88 nutrition edit studies of the benefits of supplementation with calcium and vitamin d are conflicting possibly because most studies did not have people with low dietary intakes 89 a 2013 review by the uspstf found insufficient evidence to determine if supplementation with calcium and vitamin d results in greater harm or benefit in men and premenopausal women 90 the uspstf did not recommend low dose supplementation less than of calcium and of vitamin d in postmenopausal women as there does not appear to be a difference in fracture risk 90 it is unknown what effect higher doses have 90 a 2015 review found little data that supplementation of calcium decreases the risk of fractures 91 while some meta analyses have found a benefit of vitamin d supplements combined with calcium for fractures they did not find a benefit of vitamin d supplements alone 92 93 while supplementation does not appear to affect the risk of death 93 there is an increased risk of myocardial infarctions with calcium supplementation 94 95 kidney stones 90 and stomach problems 93 vitamin k deficiency is also a risk factor for osteoporotic fractures the gene gamma glutamyl carboxylase ggcx is dependent on vitamin k functional polymorphisms in the gene could attribute to variation in bone metabolism and bmd vitamin k2 is also used as a means of treatment for osteoporosis and the polymorphisms of ggcx could explain the individual variation in the response to treatment of vitamin k 96 vitamin k supplementation may reduce the risk of fractures in postmenopausal women 97 however there is no evidence for men 98 physical exercise edit a 2011 review reported a small benefit of physical exercise on bone density of postmenopausal women 99 the chances of having a fracture were also slightly reduced absolute difference 4 99 people who exercised had on average less bone loss 0 85 at the spine 1.03% at the hip 99 management edit lifestyle edit weight bearing endurance exercise and or exercises to strengthen muscles improve bone strength in those with osteoporosis 99 100 aerobics weight bearing and resistance exercises all maintain or increase bmd in postmenopausal women 99 fall prevention can help prevent osteoporosis complications there is some evidence for hip protectors specifically among those who are in care homes 101 medications edit bisphosphonates are useful in decreasing the risk of future fractures in those who have already sustained a fracture due to osteoporosis 5 6 87 this benefit is present when taken for three to four years 102 different bisphosphonates have not been directly compared therefore it is unknown if one is better than another 87 fracture risk reduction is between 25 and 70% depending on the bone involved 87 there are concerns of atypical femoral fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw with long term use but these risks are low 87 103 with evidence of little benefit when used for more than three to five years and in light of the potential adverse events it may be appropriate to stop treatment after this time 102 one medical organization recommends that after five years of medications by mouth or three years of intravenous medication among those at low risk bisphosphonate treatment can be stopped 104 105 in those at higher risk they recommend up to ten years of medication by mouth or six years of intravenous treatment 104 for those with osteoporosis but who have not had a fracture evidence does not support a reduction in fracture risk with risedronate 6 or etidronate 9 alendronate decreases fractures of the spine but does not have any effect on other types of fractures 5 half stop their medications within a year 106 when on treatment with bisphosphonates rechecking bone mineral density is not needed 105 another review found tentative evidence of benefit in males with osteoporosis 107 fluoride supplementation does not appear to be effective in postmenopausal osteoporosis as even though it increases bone density it does not decrease the risk of fractures 108 109 teriparatide a recombinant parathyroid hormone has been shown to be effective in treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis 110 some evidence also indicates strontium ranelate is effective in decreasing the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis 111 hormone replacement therapy while effective for osteoporosis is only recommended in women who also have menopausal symptoms 87 it is not recommended for osteoporosis by itself 105 raloxifene while effective in decreasing vertebral fractures does not affect the risk of nonvertebral fracture 87 and while it reduces the risk of breast cancer it increases the risk of blood clots and strokes 87 denosumab is also effective for preventing osteoporotic fractures but not in males 87 107 in hypogonadal men testosterone has been shown to improve bone quantity and quality but as of 2008 no studies evaluated its effect on fracture risk or in men with a normal testosterone levels 56 calcitonin while once recommended is no longer due to the associated risk of cancer and questionable effect on fracture risk 112 certain medications like alendronate etidronate risedronate raloxifene and strontium ranelate can be helpful for the preventing of osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis 113 prognosis edit hip fractures per 1000 person years 114 who category age age 64 overall normal 5.3 9.4 6.6 osteopenia 11.4 19.6 15.7 osteoporosis 22.4 46.6 40.6 although osteoporosis patients have an increased mortality rate due to the complications of fracture it is rarely lethal hip fractures can lead to decreased mobility and additional risks of numerous complications such as deep venous thrombosis and or pulmonary embolism and pneumonia the six month mortality rate for those aged 50 and above following hip fracture was found to be around 13.5 with a substantial proportion almost 13 needing total assistance to mobilize after a hip fracture 115 vertebral fractures while having a smaller impact on mortality can lead to a severe chronic pain of neurogenic origin which can be hard to control as well as deformity though rare multiple vertebral fractures can lead to such severe hunch back kyphosis the resulting pressure on internal organs can impair ability to breathe apart from risk of death and other complications osteoporotic fractures are associated with a reduced health related quality of life 116 the condition is responsible for millions of fractures annually mostly involving the lumbar vertebrae hip and wrist fragility fractures of ribs are also common in men hip fractures edit hip fractures are responsible for the most serious consequences of osteoporosis in the united states more than 250,000 hip fractures annually are attributable to osteoporosis 117 a 50 year old white woman is estimated to have a 17.5% lifetime risk of fracture of the proximal femur the incidence of hip fractures increases each decade from the sixth through the ninth for both women and men for all populations the highest incidence is found among men and women ages 80 or older 118 vertebral fractures edit between 35 and 50% of all women over 50 had at least one vertebral fracture in the united states 700,000 vertebral fractures occur annually but only about a third are recognized in a series of 9704 women aged 68.8 on average studied for 15 years 324 had already suffered a vertebral fracture at entry into the study and 18.2% developed a vertebral fracture but that risk rose to 41.4% in women who had a previous vertebral fracture 119 wrist fractures edit in the united states 250,000 wrist fractures annually are attributable to osteoporosis 117 wrist fractures are the third most common type of osteoporotic fractures the lifetime risk of sustaining a colles fracture is about 16% for white women by the time women reach age 70 about 20% have had at least one wrist fracture 118 rib fractures edit fragility fractures of the ribs are common in men as young as age 35 these are often overlooked as signs of osteoporosis as these men are often physically active and suffer the fracture in the course of physical activity an example would be as a result of falling while water skiing or jet skiing however a quick test of the testosterone level following the diagnosis of the fracture will readily reveal whether that individual might be at risk epidemiology edit it is estimated that 200 million people have osteoporosis 120 osteoporosis becomes more common with age 3 about 15% of white people in their 50s and 70% of those over 80 are affected 7 it is more common in women than men 3 in the developed world depending on the method of diagnosis 2% to 8% of males and 9% to 38% of females are affected 11 rates of disease in the developing world are unclear 12 there are 8.9 million fractures worldwide per year due to osteoporosis 121 globally 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men over the age of 50 will have an osteoporotic fracture 121 data from the united states shows a decrease in osteoporosis within the general population and in white women from 18% in 1994 to 10% in 2006 122 white and asian people are at greater risk 3 people of african descent are at a decreased risk of fractures due to osteoporosis although they have the highest risk of death following an osteoporotic fracture 122 it has been shown that latitude affects risk of osteoporotic fracture 123 areas of higher latitude such as northern europe receive less vitamin d through sunlight compared to regions closer to the equator and consequently have higher fracture rates in comparison to lower latitudes 123 for example swedish men and women have a 13.% and 28.5% risk of hip fracture by age 50 respectively whereas this risk is only 1.9% and 2.4% in chinese men and women 122 diet may also be a factor that is responsible for this difference as vitamin d calcium magnesium and folate are all linked to bone mineral density 124 about 22 million women and 5.5 million men in the european union had osteoporosis in 2010 13 in the united states in 2010 about 8 million women and one to 2 million men had osteoporosis 11 14 this places a large economic burden on the healthcare system due to costs of treatment long term disability and loss of productivity in the working population the eu spends 37 billion euros per year in healthcare costs related to osteoporosis and the usa spends an estimated 19 billion usd annually for related healthcare costs 121 history edit the link between age related reductions in bone density and fracture risk goes back at least to astley cooper and the term osteoporosis and recognition of its pathological appearance is generally attributed to the french pathologist jean lobstein 125 the american endocrinologist fuller albright linked osteoporosis with the postmenopausal state 126 bisphosphonates were discovered in the 1960s 127 anthropologists have studied skeletal remains that showed loss of bone density and associated structural changes that were linked to a chronic malnutrition in the agricultural area in which these individuals lived it follows that the skeletal deformation may be attributed to their heavy labor in agriculture as well as to their chronic malnutrition causing the osteoporosis seen when radiographs of the remains were made 128 osteoporosis means porous bones from greek ostoun meaning bone and poros meaning pore references
