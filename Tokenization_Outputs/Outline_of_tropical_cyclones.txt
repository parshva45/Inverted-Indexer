outline of tropical cyclones wikipedia outline of tropical cyclones from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to tropical cyclones tropical cyclone storm system characterized by a large low pressure center and numerous thunderstorms that produce strong winds and heavy rain tropical cyclones strengthen when water evaporated from the ocean is released as the saturated air rises resulting in condensation of water vapor contained in the moist air they are fueled by a different heat mechanism than other cyclonic windstorms such as european windstorms and polar lows the characteristic that separates tropical cyclones from other cyclonic systems is that at any height in the atmosphere the center of a tropical cyclone will be warmer than its surroundings a phenomenon called warm core storm systems contents 1 nature of tropical cyclones 2 types of tropical cyclones 3 tropical cyclone observations

be described as all of the following storm disturbed state of an environment or astronomical atmosphere especially affecting its surface and strongly implying severe weather it may be marked by significant disruptions to normal conditions such as strong wind hail thunder and lightning a thunderstorm heavy precipitation snowstorm rainstorm heavy freezing rain ice storm strong winds tropical cyclone windstorm or wind transporting some substance through the atmosphere such as sand or debris natural disaster major adverse event resulting from natural processes of the earth examples include floods volcanic eruptions earthquakes tsunamis and other geologic processes a natural disaster can cause loss of life or property damage and typically leaves some economic damage in its wake the severity of which depends on the affected resilience or ability to recover types of tropical cyclones edit cumulative graph of tropical cyclones in the eastern pacific tropical cyclone subtropical
