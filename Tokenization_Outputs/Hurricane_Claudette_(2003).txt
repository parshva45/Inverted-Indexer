storm and first hurricane of the 2003 atlantic hurricane season a fairly long lived july atlantic hurricane claudette began as a tropical wave in the eastern caribbean it moved quickly westward brushing past the peninsula before moving northwestward through the gulf of mexico claudette remained a tropical storm until just before making landfall in port texas when it quickly strengthened to a strong hurricane on the saffir simpson hurricane scale forecasting of its path and intensity was uncertain throughout its lifetime resulting in widespread and often unnecessary preparations along its path claudette was the first hurricane to make landfall in july in the united states since hurricane danny in the 1997 season the hurricane caused one death and moderate damage in texas mostly from strong winds as well as extensive beach erosion because of the damage president george w bush declared portions of south texas a federal disaster area allowing the affected citizens to apply for aid claudette also caused significant rainfall and minor damage in the mexican state of quintana roo as a tropical storm as well as minor damage on saint lucia before developing into a tropical cyclone

intensity of the storm according to the scale a tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on july 1 it steadily organized as it moved westward and resembled a tropical depression by july 7 however surface reports and reconnaissance aircraft indicated the system did not have tropical characteristics and remained simply a low pressure system the wave produced tropical storm force winds as it moved through the lesser antilles on july 8 but did not acquire tropical characteristics until it reached the eastern caribbean because it had tropical storm force winds the system was upgraded immediately to tropical storm claudette after it developed a low level circulation later on july 8 1 by early on july 9 while south of puerto rico claudette quickly strengthened over the warm waters of the caribbean and its strongest winds were just shy of the threshold for hurricane intensity possibly due to its fast forward motion the storm became disorganized and weakened conditions briefly became more favorable over the western caribbean and claudette reached hurricane status for six hours on july 10 soon after the storm encountered unfavorable upper level winds and weakened back into a tropical storm in response to a break in the subtropical ridge high pressure ridge that often prevents tropical systems from moving turned to the west northwest claudette made its first landfall at puerto morelos on the peninsula on july 11 as a tropical storm with winds 1 hurricane claudette making landfall at texas on july 15 claudette wobbled to the northwest over the gulf of mexico and gradually restrengthened upper level winds steadily decreased and claudette again became a hurricane late on july 14 just prior to landfall it strengthened quickly and picked up its forward motion in a more westerly direction striking port texas on july 15 as a hurricane on the saffir simpson hurricane scale with winds residents along and inland of the central texas coast were caught off guard both by its intensity and its time of arrival the hurricane was projected to make landfall in the evening hours of july 15 but instead came ashore before noon 2 furthermore some initial estimates suggested that claudette had reached status with sustained winds of up to these were based on unofficial observations which were not backed up by official data 1 as slow as claudette was to strengthen it was also slow to dissipate over land inland hurricane warnings were issued for several counties away from the coastline and winds gusted to at victoria regional airport 2 it maintained tropical storm intensity for over after landfall a rarity for such a weak storm most tropical systems weaken rapidly after landfall as they are separated from the warm waters that power them the storm finally lost its low level circulation early on july 17 over chihuahua although its rainfall and upper level circulation continued into the pacific ocean 1 preparations edit mexican officials issued a tropical storm warning prior to the landfall between chetumal and cabo catoche quintana roo the warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning about a day before landfall but was downgraded when claudette weakened just prior to its landfall in the peninsula 1 the mexican government declared a state of emergency in the projected path of the storm and declared an evacuation order for 1,500 citizens in quintana roo there residents remained calm during the evacuation 3 tourists left nightclubs for supermarkets to stock up on among other items beer which was banned at midnight schools were set up as shelters while police forced tourists to remain in their hotels 4 the consistent variation in the path of claudette caused uncertainty over the strength and location of its final landfall on july 13 two days prior to eventual landfall the national hurricane center issued a hurricane watch between brownsville and port texas by the next day a hurricane warning existed from baffin bay to high island texas while a tropical storm warning extended from high island to intracoastal city louisiana when it became apparent that louisiana would not be affected significantly by the storm the tropical storm warnings were canceled 1 in texas galveston county officials recommended evacuations for western galveston island and jamaica beach prior to projected landfall the emergency phone notification system notified citizens in the evening to avoid evacuating during the night many citizens heeded the evacuation suggestion some of whom remembered the flooding from tropical storm
