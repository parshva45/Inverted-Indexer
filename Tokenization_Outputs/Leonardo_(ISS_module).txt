multipurpose module pmm is a module of the international space station it was flown into space aboard the space shuttle on sts 133 on 24 february 2011 and installed on 1 march leonardo is primarily used for storage of spares supplies and waste on the iss which was until then stored in many different places within the space station the leonardo pmm was a multi purpose logistics module mplm before 2011 but was modified into its current configuration it was formerly one of three mplm used for bringing cargo to and from the iss with the space shuttle the module was named for italian polymath leonardo da vinci contents 1 previous proposals 2 modifications 3 as an mplm 3.1 flights 4 see also 5 references 6 external links previous proposals edit a european proposal suggested equipping the donatello mplm with enhanced micrometeoroid and orbital debris protection and cooling systems and leaving it attached to the iss after the space shuttle fleet is retired costs for such mplm modifications were estimated at 20m to 40m per unit the mplm would then be called a permanent multipurpose module pmm and it would house spare parts and supplies allowing longer times between resupply missions the proposal was rejected by nasa because it would require changes to existing plans and would entail additional costs 1 internal discussions continued 2 and managers considered the possibility of sts 133 which at that time was planned to be the last shuttle flight leaving its mplm permanently attached 3 the united launch alliance also published a proposal for a system that could allow additional iss modules to be launched on an eelv even after the retirement of the shuttle 4 on august 5 2009 it was announced that sts 133 would indeed leave one mplm permanently attached to the station 5 in october 2009 it was confirmed that leonardo would be the mplm converted to a pmm 6 it was launched on february 24 2011 the pmm was transferred to the station using the shuttle robotic arm and mated to the nadir earth facing port of unity on may 27 2015 at 13 08 utc the pmm was relocated from the nadir port of the unity module to the forward facing port of the tranquility node 3 module this was done in order to allow unity s nadir port to serve as a berthing port for resupply craft which in turn frees up harmony s zenith port for future u s commercial crew development spacecraft 7 modifications edit pmm leonardo at the space station processing facility sspf after returning to earth on april 20 2010 at the end of the sts 131 mission the leonardo mplm was moved to the space station processing facility sspf at the kennedy space center in florida to undergo modifications to convert the leonardo mplm into the pmm nasa made the following modifications removal of y grapple fixture flight releasable grapple fixture or frgf removal of rofu remotely operated fluid umbilical components replacement of cbm seal installation of new forward end cone mmod shields feed through seal replacement and installation of visiting vehicle retro reflectors in addition the multi layer insulation mli blankets from the never flown donatello mplm were cannibalized for use on leonardo the blankets were removed and returned to italy where they were reinforced with nextel kevlar to provide better protection against micro meteorites the upgraded blankets were then installed on about two thirds of surface area 8 the leonardo pmm mass is 21,817 pounds 9 as an mplm edit leonardo leonardo being prepared for flight on sts 105 station statistics part of international space station launch

multi purpose logistics modules which were operated by nasa to transfer supplies and equipment to and from the international space station leonardo was used for eight of the twelve mplm flights to the space station with raffaello being used for the other four it was the first mplm to be launched making its first flight in march 2001 aboard space shuttle discovery on sts 102 following its last flight as an mplm on sts 131 in april 2010 it underwent conversion to become the permanent multipurpose module and was launched aboard discovery on sts 133 to become a permanent component of the station like the other multi purpose logistics modules it was constructed by the italian space agency who chose to name it after leonardo da vinci 10 construction began in april 1996 and the module was delivered to nasa at the kennedy space center in august 1998 by an airbus beluga aircraft 11 flights edit mission orbiter launch utc 12 landing utc remarks sts 102 discovery 8 march 2001 21 march
