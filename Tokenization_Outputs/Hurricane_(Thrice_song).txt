video countdown 4 themes and composition edit the song has been described as very ominous and doom laden 5 the song opens with gentle melodic and melancholic clean guitar notes followed by vocals by kensrue 6 the verses show a calm soothing conversation of two lovers speaking about how to avoid an upcoming hurricane while the chorus erupts with large distorted guitars and intense vocals representing the coming of the storm 6 frontman dustin kensrue outlined the ideas and concepts explored in the song thrice being a heavier kind of band and me being a bit drawn to the bigger issues of life in general all that gravitates a lot of times towards writing pretty weighty heavy lyrics to be everywhere is to be nowhere was no exception listening to it with everything going on and just this weight and heaviness to it hurricane is a good example of my trying to find something that fits there the beauty and calm of the verses slamming into this huge thing and trying to find something that works with that and i end up writing something where i end up questioning why all these beautiful moments in time are always shattered by something because what the music feels likes its doing 3 despite teppei teranishi typically being the lead guitarist kensrue both wrote and played the lead guitar part in the song something attributed to the fact that he wrote the part and because he felt it sounds better coming from his particular guitar rig and guitar pedal setup specifically the electro harmonix pog 2 7 personnel edit dustin kensrue lead vocals rhythm guitar teppei teranishi lead
