portal tropical cyclone category climatology climate category climate change category global warming category portal v t e meteorology is a branch of the atmospheric sciences which includes atmospheric chemistry and atmospheric physics with a major focus on weather forecasting the study of meteorology dates back millennia though significant progress in meteorology did not occur until the 18th century the 19th century saw modest progress in the field after weather observation networks were formed across broad regions prior attempts at prediction of weather depended on historical data it until after the elucidation of the laws of physics and more particularly the development of the computer allowing for the automated solution of a great many equations that model the weather in the latter half of the 20th century that significant breakthroughs in weather forecasting were achieved meteorological phenomena are observable weather events that are explained by the science of meteorology meteorological phenomena are described and quantified by the variables of atmosphere temperature air pressure water vapor mass flow and the variations and interactions of those variables and how they change over time different spatial scales are used to describe and predict weather on local regional and global levels meteorology climatology atmospheric physics and atmospheric chemistry are sub disciplines of the atmospheric sciences meteorology and hydrology compose the interdisciplinary field of hydrometeorology the interactions between atmosphere and its oceans are part of a coupled ocean atmosphere system meteorology has application in many diverse fields such as the military energy production transport agriculture and construction the word meteorology is from greek

ability to predict rains and floods based on annual cycles was evidently used by humans at least from the time of agricultural settlement if not earlier early approaches to predicting weather were based on astrology and were practiced by priests cuneiform inscriptions on babylonian tablets included associations between thunder and rain the chaldeans differentiated the and halos 1 ancient indian upanishads contain mentions of clouds and seasons 2 the samaveda mentions sacrifices to be performed when certain phenomena were noticed 1 s classical work brihatsamhita written about 500 ad 2 provides evidence of weather observation in 350 bc aristotle wrote meteorology 3 aristotle is considered the founder of meteorology 4 one of the most impressive achievements described in the meteorology is the description of what is now known as the hydrologic cycle 5 the book de mundo composed before 250 bc or between 350 and 200 bc noted 6 if the flashing body is set on fire and rushes violently to the earth it is called a thunderbolt if it is only half of fire but violent also and massive it is called a meteor if it is entirely free from fire it is called a smoking bolt they are all called swooping bolts because they swoop down upon the earth lightning is sometimes smoky and is then called smoldering lightning sometimes it darts quickly along and is then said to be vivid at other times it travels in crooked lines and is called forked lightning when it swoops down upon some object it is called swooping lightning the greek scientist theophrastus compiled a book on weather forecasting called the book of signs the work of theophrastus remained a dominant influence in the study of weather and in weather forecasting for nearly 2,000 years 7 in 25 ad pomponius mela a geographer for the roman empire formalized the climatic zone system 8 according to toufic fahd around the 9th century al dinawari wrote the kitab al nabat book of plants in which he deals with the application of meteorology to agriculture during the muslim agricultural revolution he describes the meteorological character of the sky the planets and constellations the sun and moon the lunar phases indicating seasons and rain the anwa heavenly bodies of rain and atmospheric phenomena such as winds thunder lightning snow floods valleys rivers lakes 9 10 verification needed early attempts at predicting weather were often related to prophesy and divining and sometimes based on astrological ideas admiral fitzroy tried to separate scientific approaches from prophetic ones 11 research of visual atmospheric phenomena edit twilight at baker beach see also rainbow and twilight ptolemy wrote on the atmospheric refraction of light in the context of astronomical observations 12 in 1021 alhazen showed that atmospheric refraction is also responsible for twilight he estimated that twilight begins when the sun is 19 degrees below the horizon and also used a geometric determination based on this to estimate the maximum possible height of the atmosphere as 52,000 passim about 49 miles or 13 st albert the great was the first to propose that each drop of falling rain had the form of a small sphere and that this form meant that the rainbow was produced by light interacting with each raindrop 14 roger bacon was the first to calculate the angular size of the rainbow he stated that a rainbow summit can not appear higher than 42 degrees above the horizon 15 in the late 13th century and early 14th century and theodoric of freiberg were the first to give the correct explanations for the primary rainbow phenomenon theoderic went further and also explained the secondary rainbow 16 in 1716 edmund halley suggested that aurorae are caused by magnetic effluvia moving along the magnetic field lines instruments and classification scales edit see also beaufort scale celsius and fahrenheit a hemispherical cup anemometer in 1441 king sejong s son prince munjong invented the first

assigns cloud types latin names 22 in 1806 francis beaufort introduced his system for classifying wind speeds 23 near the end of the 19th century the first cloud atlases were published including the international cloud atlas which has remained in print ever since the april 1960 launch of the first successful weather satellite tiros 1 marked the beginning of the age where weather information became available globally atmospheric composition research edit in 1648 blaise pascal rediscovered that atmospheric pressure decreases with height and deduced that there is a vacuum above the atmosphere 24 in 1738 daniel bernoulli published hydrodynamics initiating the kinetic theory of gases and established the basic laws for the theory of gases 25 in 1761 joseph black discovered that ice absorbs heat without changing its temperature when melting in 1772 student daniel rutherford discovered nitrogen which he called phlogisticated air and together they developed the phlogiston theory 26 in 1777 antoine lavoisier discovered oxygen and developed an explanation for combustion 27 in 1783 in essay reflexions sur le phlogistique 28 he deprecates the phlogiston theory and proposes a caloric theory 29 30 in 1804 sir john leslie observed that a matte black surface radiates heat more effectively than a polished surface suggesting the importance of black body radiation in 1808 john dalton defended caloric theory in a new system of chemistry and described how it combines with matter especially gases he proposed that the heat capacity of gases varies inversely with atomic weight in 1824 sadi carnot analyzed the efficiency of steam engines using caloric theory he developed the notion of a reversible process and in postulating that no such thing exists in nature laid the foundation for the second law of thermodynamics research into cyclones and air flow edit general circulation of the atmosphere the westerlies and trade winds are part of the atmospheric circulation main articles coriolis effect and prevailing winds in 1494 christopher columbus experienced a tropical cyclone which led to the first written european account of a hurricane 31 in 1686 edmund halley presented a systematic study of the trade winds and monsoons and identified solar heating as the cause of atmospheric motions 32 in 1735 an ideal explanation of global circulation through study of the trade winds was written by george hadley 33 in 1743 when benjamin franklin was prevented from seeing a lunar eclipse by a hurricane he decided that cyclones move in a contrary manner to the winds at their periphery 34 understanding the kinematics of how exactly the rotation of the earth affects airflow was partial at first gaspard gustave coriolis published a paper in 1835 on the energy yield of machines with rotating parts such as waterwheels 35 in 1856 william ferrel proposed the existence of a circulation cell in the mid latitudes and the air within deflected by the coriolis force resulting in the prevailing westerly winds 36 late in the 19th century the motion of air masses along isobars was understood to be the result of the large scale interaction of the pressure gradient force and the deflecting force by 1912 this deflecting force was named the coriolis effect 37 just after world war i a group of meteorologists in norway led by vilhelm bjerknes developed the norwegian cyclone model that explains the generation intensification and ultimate decay the life cycle of mid latitude cyclones and introduced the idea of fronts that is sharply defined boundaries between air masses 38 the group included carl gustaf rossby who was the first to explain the large scale atmospheric flow in terms of fluid dynamics tor bergeron who first determined how rain forms and jacob bjerknes observation networks and weather forecasting edit cloud classification by altitude of occurrence see also history of surface weather analysis in 1654 ferdinando ii de medici established the first weather observing network that consisted of meteorological stations in florence cutigliano vallombrosa bologna parma milan innsbruck paris and warsaw the collected data were sent to florence at regular time intervals 39 in 1832 an electromagnetic telegraph was created by baron schilling 40 the arrival of the electrical telegraph in 1837 afforded for the first time a practical method for quickly gathering surface weather observations from a wide area 41 this data could be used to produce maps of the state of the atmosphere for a region near the surface and to study how these states evolved through time to make frequent weather forecasts based on these data required a reliable network of observations but it was not until 1849 that the smithsonian institution began to establish an observation network across the united states under the leadership of joseph henry 42 similar observation networks were established in europe at this time the reverend william clement ley was key in understanding of cirrus clouds and early understandings of jet streams 43 later after this charles kenneth mackinnon douglas known as ckm douglas read papers after his death and carried on the early study of weather systems 44 nineteenth century researchers in meteorology were drawn from military or medical backgrounds rather than trained as dedicated scientists 45 in 1854 the united kingdom government appointed robert fitzroy to the new office of meteorological statist to the board of trade with the task of gathering weather observations at sea office became the united kingdom meteorological office in 1854 the second oldest national meteorological service in the world the central institution for meteorology and geodynamics zamg in austria was founded in 1851 and is the oldest weather service in the world the first daily weather forecasts made by office were published in the times newspaper in 1860 the following year a system was introduced of hoisting storm warning cones at principal ports when a gale was expected over the next 50 years many countries established national meteorological services the india meteorological department 1875 was established to follow tropical cyclone and monsoon 46 the finnish meteorological central office 1881 was formed from part of magnetic observatory of helsinki university 47 tokyo meteorological observatory the forerunner of the japan meteorological agency began constructing surface weather maps in 1883 48 the united states weather bureau 1890 was established under the united states department of agriculture the australian bureau of meteorology 1906 was established by a meteorology act to unify existing state meteorological services 49 50 numerical weather prediction edit main article numerical weather prediction a meteorologist at the console of the ibm 7090 in the joint numerical weather prediction unit c 1965 in 1904 norwegian scientist vilhelm bjerknes first argued in his paper weather forecasting as a problem in mechanics and physics that it should be possible to forecast weather from calculations based upon natural laws 51 52 it was not until later in the 20th century that advances in the understanding of atmospheric physics led to the foundation of modern numerical weather prediction in 1922 lewis fry richardson published weather prediction by numerical process 53 after finding notes and derivations he worked on as an ambulance driver in world war i he described how small terms in the prognostic fluid dynamics equations that govern atmospheric flow could be neglected and a numerical calculation scheme that could be devised to allow predictions richardson envisioned a large auditorium of thousands of people performing the calculations however the sheer number of calculations required was too large to complete without electronic computers and the size of the grid and time steps used in the calculations led to unrealistic results though numerical analysis later found that this was due to numerical instability starting in the 1950s numerical forecasts with computers became feasible 54 the first weather forecasts derived this way used barotropic single vertical level models and could successfully predict the large scale movement of midlatitude rossby waves that is the pattern of atmospheric lows and highs 55 in 1959 the uk meteorological office received its first computer a ferranti mercury citation needed in the 1960s the chaotic nature of the atmosphere was first observed and mathematically described by edward lorenz founding the field of chaos theory 56 these advances have led to the current use of ensemble forecasting in most major forecasting centers to take into account uncertainty arising from the chaotic nature of the atmosphere 57 mathematical models used to predict the long term weather of the earth climate models have been developed that have a resolution today that are as coarse as the older weather prediction models these climate models are used to investigate long term climate shifts such as what effects might be caused by human emission of greenhouse gases meteorologists edit further information weather forecasting meteorologists are scientists who study meteorology 58 the american meteorological society published and continually updates an authoritative electronic meteorology glossary 59 meteorologists work in government agencies private consulting and research services industrial enterprises utilities radio and television stations and in education in the united states meteorologists held about 9,400 jobs in 2009 60 meteorologists are best known by the public for weather forecasting some radio and television weather forecasters are professional meteorologists while others are reporters weather specialist weatherman etc with no formal meteorological training the american meteorological society and national weather association issue seals of approval to weather broadcasters who meet certain requirements equipment edit satellite image of hurricane hugo with a polar low visible at the top of the image main article meteorological instrumentation each science has its own unique sets of laboratory equipment in the atmosphere there are many things or qualities of the atmosphere that can be measured rain which can be observed or seen anywhere and anytime was one of the first atmospheric qualities measured historically also two other accurately measured qualities are wind and humidity neither of these can be seen but can be felt the devices to measure these three sprang up in the mid 15th century and were respectively the rain gauge the anemometer and the hygrometer many attempts had been made prior to the 15th century to construct adequate equipment to measure the many atmospheric variables many were faulty in some way or were simply not reliable even aristotle noted this in some of his work as the difficulty to measure the air sets of surface measurements are important data to meteorologists they give a snapshot of a variety of weather conditions at one single location and are usually at a weather station a ship or a weather buoy the measurements taken at a weather station can include any number of atmospheric observables usually temperature pressure wind measurements and humidity are the variables that are measured by a thermometer barometer anemometer and hygrometer respectively 61 professional stations may also include air quality sensors carbon monoxide carbon dioxide methane ozone dust and smoke ceilometer cloud ceiling falling precipitation sensor flood sensor lightning sensor microphone explosions sonic booms thunder pyranometer pyrheliometer spectroradiometer ir vis uv photodiodes rain gauge snow gauge scintillation counter background radiation fallout radon seismometer earthquakes and tremors transmissometer visibility and a gps clock for data logging upper air data are of crucial importance for weather forecasting the most widely used technique is launches of radiosondes supplementing the radiosondes a network of aircraft collection is organized by the world meteorological organization remote sensing as used in meteorology is the concept of collecting data from remote weather events and subsequently producing weather information the common types of remote sensing are radar lidar and satellites or photogrammetry each collects data about the atmosphere from a remote location and usually stores the data where the instrument is located radar and lidar are not passive because both use em radiation to illuminate a specific portion of the atmosphere 62 weather satellites along with more general purpose earth observing satellites circling the earth at various altitudes have become an indispensable tool for studying a wide range of phenomena from forest fires to el spatial scales edit the study of the atmosphere can be divided into distinct areas that depend on both time and spatial scales at one extreme of this scale is climatology in the timescales of hours to days meteorology separates into micro meso and synoptic scale meteorology respectively the geospatial size of each of these three scales relates directly with the appropriate timescale other subclassifications are used to describe the unique local or broad effects within those subclasses typical scales of atmospheric motion systems 63 type of motion horizontal scale meter molecular mean free path 10 minute turbulent eddies 10 10 small eddies 10 1 dust devils 1 10 gusts 10 10 2 tornadoes 10 2

meteorology microscale meteorology is the study of atmospheric phenomena on a scale of about 1 kilometre or less individual thunderstorms clouds and local turbulence caused by buildings and other obstacles such as individual hills are modeled on this scale 64 mesoscale edit main article mesoscale meteorology mesoscale meteorology is the study of atmospheric phenomena that has horizontal scales ranging from to and a vertical scale that starts at the surface and includes the atmospheric boundary layer troposphere tropopause and the lower section of the stratosphere mesoscale timescales last from less than a day to weeks the events typically of interest are thunderstorms squall lines fronts precipitation bands in tropical and extratropical cyclones and topographically generated weather systems such as mountain waves and sea and land breezes 65 synoptic scale edit noaa synoptic scale weather analysis main article synoptic scale meteorology synoptic scale meteorology predicts atmospheric changes at scales up to and 10 5 sec 28 days in time and space at the synoptic scale the coriolis acceleration acting on moving air masses outside of the tropics plays a dominant role in predictions the phenomena typically described by synoptic meteorology include events such as extratropical cyclones baroclinic troughs and ridges frontal zones and to some extent jet streams all of these are typically given on weather maps for a specific time the minimum horizontal scale of synoptic phenomena is limited to the spacing between surface observation stations 66 global scale edit annual mean sea surface temperatures global scale meteorology is the study of weather patterns related to the transport of heat from the tropics to the poles very large scale oscillations are of importance at this scale these oscillations have time periods typically on the order of months such as the oscillation or years such as the el oscillation and the pacific decadal oscillation global scale meteorology pushes into the range of climatology the traditional definition of climate is pushed into larger timescales and with the understanding of the longer time scale global oscillations their effect on climate and weather disturbances can be included in the synoptic and mesoscale timescales predictions numerical weather prediction is a main focus in understanding interaction tropical meteorology atmospheric predictability and tropospheric stratospheric processes 67 the naval research laboratory in monterey california developed a global atmospheric model called navy operational global atmospheric prediction system nogaps nogaps is run operationally at fleet numerical meteorology and oceanography center for the united states military many other global atmospheric models are run by national meteorological agencies some meteorological principles edit boundary layer meteorology edit boundary layer meteorology is the study of processes in the air layer directly above surface known as the atmospheric boundary layer abl the effects of the heating cooling and friction cause turbulent mixing within the air layer significant movement of heat matter or momentum on time scales of less than a day are caused by turbulent motions 68 boundary layer meteorology includes the study of all types of boundary including ocean lake urban land and non urban land for the study of meteorology dynamic meteorology edit dynamic meteorology generally focuses on the fluid dynamics of the atmosphere the idea of air parcel is used to define the smallest element of the atmosphere while ignoring the discrete molecular and chemical nature of the atmosphere an air parcel is defined as a point in the fluid continuum of the atmosphere the fundamental laws of fluid dynamics thermodynamics and motion are used to study the atmosphere the physical quantities that characterize the state of the atmosphere are temperature density pressure etc these variables have unique values in the continuum 69 applications edit weather forecasting edit forecast of surface pressures five days into the future for the north pacific north america and north atlantic ocean main article weather forecasting weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere at a future time and given location humans have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since at least the 19th century 70 71 weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere and using scientific understanding of atmospheric processes to project how the atmosphere will evolve 72 once an all human endeavor based mainly upon changes in barometric pressure current weather conditions and sky condition 73 74 forecast models are now used to determine future conditions human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon which involves pattern recognition skills teleconnections knowledge of model performance and knowledge of model biases the chaotic nature of the atmosphere the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere error involved in measuring the initial conditions and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes mean that forecasts become less accurate as the difference in current time and the time for which the forecast is being made the range of the forecast increases the use of ensembles and model consensus help narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome 75 76 77 there are a variety of end uses to weather forecasts weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property 78 forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture 79 80 81 82 and therefore to commodity traders within stock markets temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days 83 84 85 on an everyday basis people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain snow and wind chill forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events and to plan ahead and survive them aviation meteorology edit aviation meteorology deals with the impact of weather on air traffic management it is important for air crews to understand the implications of weather on their flight plan as well as their aircraft as noted by the aeronautical information manual 86 the effects of ice on aircraft are is reduced drag increases lift lessens and weight increases the results are an increase in stall speed and a deterioration of aircraft performance in extreme cases 2 to 3 inches of ice can form on the leading edge of the airfoil in less than 5 minutes it takes but 1/2 inch of ice to reduce the lifting power of some aircraft by 50 percent and increases the frictional drag by an equal percentage 87 agricultural meteorology edit meteorologists soil scientists agricultural hydrologists and agronomists are persons concerned with studying the effects of weather and climate on plant distribution crop yield water use efficiency phenology of plant and animal development and the energy balance of managed and natural ecosystems conversely they are interested in the role of vegetation on climate and weather 88 hydrometeorology edit hydrometeorology is the branch of meteorology that deals with the hydrologic cycle the water budget and the rainfall statistics of storms 89 a hydrometeorologist prepares and issues forecasts of accumulating quantitative precipitation heavy rain heavy snow and highlights areas with the potential for flash flooding typically the range of knowledge that is required overlaps with climatology mesoscale and synoptic meteorology and other geosciences 90 the multidisciplinary nature of the branch can result in technical challenges since tools and solutions from each of the individual disciplines involved may behave slightly differently be optimized for different hard and software platforms and use different data formats there are some initiatives such as the drihm project 91 that are trying to address this issue 92 nuclear meteorology edit nuclear meteorology investigates the distribution of radioactive aerosols and gases in the atmosphere 93 maritime meteorology edit maritime
