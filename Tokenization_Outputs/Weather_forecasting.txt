of surface pressures five days into the future for the north pacific north america and the north atlantic ocean weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time human beings have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since the 19th century weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere at a given place and using meteorology to project how the atmosphere will change once a human only endeavor based mainly upon changes in barometric pressure current weather conditions and sky condition weather forecasting now relies on computer based models that take many atmospheric factors into account 1 human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon which involves pattern recognition skills teleconnections knowledge of model performance and knowledge of model biases the inaccuracy of forecasting is due to the chaotic nature of the atmosphere the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere the error involved in measuring the initial conditions and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes hence forecasts become less accurate as the difference between current time and the time for which the forecast is being made the range of the forecast increases the use of ensembles and model consensus help narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome there are a variety of end uses to weather forecasts weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture and therefore to traders within commodity markets temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days on an everyday basis people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain snow and wind chill forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events and to plan ahead and survive them in 2014

meteorological agencies 10.2 other external links history edit ancient forecasting edit for millennia people have tried to forecast the weather in the babylonians predicted the weather from cloud patterns as well as astrology in about aristotle described weather patterns in meteorologica 3 later theophrastus compiled a book on weather forecasting called the book of signs 4 chinese weather prediction lore extends at least as far back as 5 which was also around the same time ancient indian astronomers developed weather prediction methods 6 in new testament times christ himself referred to deciphering and understanding local weather patterns by saying when evening comes you say it will be fair weather for the sky is red and in the morning today it will be stormy for the sky is red and overcast you know how to interpret the appearance of the sky but you cannot interpret the signs of the times 7 in ibn wahshiyya s nabatean agriculture discussed the weather forecasting of atmospheric changes and signs from the planetary astral alterations signs of rain based on observation of the lunar phases and weather forecasts based on the movement of winds 8 ancient weather forecasting methods usually relied on observed patterns of events also termed pattern recognition for example it might be observed that if the sunset was particularly red the following day often brought fair weather this experience accumulated over the generations to produce weather lore however not all which of these predictions prove reliable and many of them have since been found not to stand up to rigorous statistical testing 9 modern methods edit the royal charter sank in an 1859 storm stimulating the establishment of modern weather forecasting it was not until the invention of the electric telegraph in 1835 that the modern age of weather forecasting began 10 before that the fastest that distant weather reports could travel was around 100 miles per day but was more typically miles per day whether by land or by sea 11 12 by the late 1840s the telegraph allowed reports of weather conditions from a wide area to be received almost instantaneously 13 allowing forecasts to be made from knowledge of weather conditions further upwind the two men credited with the birth of forecasting as a science were officer of the royal navy francis beaufort and his robert fitzroy both were influential men in british naval and governmental circles and though ridiculed in the press at the time their work gained scientific credence was accepted by the royal navy and formed the basis for all of weather forecasting knowledge 14 15 beaufort developed the wind force scale and weather notation coding which he was to use in his journals for the remainder of his life he also promoted the development of reliable tide tables around british shores and with his friend william whewell expanded weather record keeping at 200 british coast guard stations robert fitzroy was appointed in 1854 as chief of a new department within the board of trade to deal with the collection of weather data at sea as a service to mariners this was the forerunner of the modern meteorological office 15 all ship captains were tasked with collating data on the weather and computing it with the use of tested instruments that were loaned for this purpose 16 weather map of europe december 10 1887 a storm in 1859 that caused the loss of the royal charter inspired fitzroy to develop charts to allow predictions to be made which he called forecasting the weather thus coining the term weather forecast 16 fifteen land stations were established to use the new telegraph to transmit to him daily reports of weather at set times leading to the first gale warning service his warning service for shipping was initiated in february 1861 with the use of telegraph communications the first daily weather forecasts were published in the times in 1861 15 in the following year a system was introduced of hoisting storm warning cones at the principal ports when a gale was expected 17 the weather book which fitzroy published in 1863 was far in advance of the scientific opinion of the time as the electric telegraph network expanded allowing for the more rapid dissemination of warnings a national observational network was developed which could then be used to provide synoptic analyses instruments to continuously record variations in meteorological parameters using photography were supplied to the observing stations from kew observatory these cameras had been invented by francis ronalds in 1845 and his barograph had earlier been used by fitzroy 18 19 to convey accurate information it soon became necessary to have a standard vocabulary describing clouds this was achieved by means of a series of classifications first achieved by luke howard in 1802 and standardized in the international cloud atlas of 1896 numerical prediction edit main article history of numerical weather prediction it was not until the 20th century that advances in the understanding of atmospheric physics led to the foundation of modern numerical weather prediction in 1922 english scientist lewis fry richardson published weather prediction by numerical process 20 after finding notes and derivations he worked on as an ambulance driver in world war i he described therein how small terms in the prognostic fluid dynamics equations governing atmospheric flow could be neglected and a finite differencing scheme in time and space could be devised to allow numerical prediction solutions to be found richardson envisioned a large auditorium of thousands of people performing the calculations and passing them to others however the sheer number of calculations required was too large to be completed without the use of computers and the size of the grid and time steps led to unrealistic results in deepening systems it was later found through numerical analysis that this was due to numerical instability 21 the first computerised weather forecast was performed by a team composed of american meteorologists jule charney philip thompson larry gates and norwegian meteorologist ragnar applied mathematician john von neumann and eniac programmer klara dan von neumann 22 23 24 practical use of numerical weather prediction began in 1955 25 spurred by the development of programmable electronic computers broadcasts edit george cowling above presented the first in vision forecast on january 11 1954 for the bbc the first ever daily weather forecasts were published in the times on august 1 1861 and the first weather maps were produced later in the same year 26 in 1911 the met office began issuing the first marine weather forecasts via radio transmission these included gale and storm warnings for areas around great britain 27 in the united states the first public radio forecasts were made in 1925 by edward b e b rideout on weei the edison electric illuminating station in boston 28 rideout came from the u s weather bureau as did wbz weather forecaster g harold noyes in 1931 the first televised weather forecasts including the use of weather maps were experimentally broadcast by the bbc in 1936 this was brought into practice in 1949 after world war ii george cowling gave the first weather forecast while being televised in front of the map in 1954 29 30 in america experimental television forecasts were made by james c fidler in cincinnati in either 1940 or 1947 on the dumont television network 28 31 in the late 1970s and early 80s john coleman the first weatherman on good morning america pioneered the use of on screen weather satellite information and computer graphics for television forecasts 32 coleman was a co founder of the weather channel twc in 1982 twc is now a 24 hour cable network some weather channels have started broadcasting on live broadcasting programs such as youtube and periscope to reach more viewers one meteorologist jeff matthews transformed the medium from forecasting live during television broadcasts to forecasting live on periscope under the name of weathertainment becoming the first meteorologist to deliver daily forecasts on a life streaming application and thus making weather forecasting interactive for the public how models create forecasts edit an example of 500 mbar geopotential height and absolute vorticity prediction from a numerical weather prediction model main article numerical weather prediction the basic idea of numerical weather prediction is to sample the state of the fluid at a given time and use the equations of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics to estimate the state of the fluid at some time in the future the main inputs from country based weather services are surface observations from automated weather stations at ground level over land and from weather buoys at sea the world meteorological organization acts to standardize the instrumentation observing practices and timing of these observations worldwide stations either report hourly in metar reports 33 or every six hours in synop reports 34 sites launch radiosondes which rise through the depth of the troposphere and well into the stratosphere 35 data from weather satellites are used in areas where traditional data sources are not available 36 37 38 compared with similar data from radiosondes the satellite data has the advantage of global coverage however at a lower accuracy and resolution 39 meteorological radar provide information on precipitation location and intensity which can be used to estimate precipitation accumulations over time 40 additionally if a pulse doppler weather radar is used then wind speed and direction can be determined 41 modern weather predictions aid in timely evacuations and potentially save lives and prevent property damage commerce provides pilot reports along aircraft routes 42 and ship reports along shipping routes research flights using reconnaissance aircraft fly in and around weather systems of interest such as tropical cyclones 43 44 reconnaissance aircraft are also flown over the open oceans during the cold season into systems that cause significant uncertainty in forecast guidance or are expected to be of high impact days into the future over the downstream continent 45 models are initialized using this observed data the irregularly spaced observations are processed by data assimilation and objective analysis methods which perform quality control and obtain values at locations usable by the mathematical algorithms usually an evenly spaced grid the data are then used in the model as the starting point for a forecast 46 commonly the set of equations used to predict the known as the physics and dynamics of the atmosphere are called primitive equations these equations are initialized from the analysis data and rates of change are determined the rates of change predict the state of the atmosphere a short time into the future the equations are then applied to this new atmospheric state to find new rates of change and these new rates of change predict the atmosphere at a yet further time into the future this time stepping procedure is continually repeated until the solution reaches the desired forecast time the length of the time step is related to the distance between the points on the computational grid the length of the time step chosen within the model is related to the distance between the points on the computational grid and is chosen to maintain numerical stability 47 time steps for global models are on the order of tens of minutes 48 while time steps for regional models are between one and four minutes 49 the global models are run at varying times into the future the met office s unified model is run six days into the future 50 the european centre for medium range weather forecasts model is run out to into the future 51 while the global forecast system model run by the environmental modeling center is run into the future 52 the visual output produced by a model solution is known as a prognostic chart or prog 53 the raw output is often modified before being presented as the forecast this can be in the form of statistical techniques to remove known biases in the model or of adjustment to take into account consensus among other numerical weather forecasts 54 mos or model output statistics is a technique used to interpret numerical model output and produce site specific guidance this guidance is presented in coded numerical form and can be obtained for nearly all national weather service reporting stations in the united states as proposed by edward lorenz in 1963 long range forecasts those made at a range of two weeks or more are impossible to definitively predict the state of the atmosphere owing to the chaotic nature of the fluid dynamics equations involved in numerical models extremely small errors in initial values double roughly every five days for variables such as temperature and wind velocity 55 essentially a model is a computer program that produces meteorological information for future times at given locations and altitudes within any modern model is a set of equations known as the primitive equations used to predict the future state of the atmosphere 56 these with the ideal gas law used to evolve the density pressure and potential temperature scalar fields and the velocity vector field of the atmosphere through time additional transport equations for pollutants and other aerosols are included in some primitive equation mesoscale models as well 57 the equations used are nonlinear partial differential equations which are impossible to solve exactly through analytical methods 58 with the exception of a few idealized cases 59 therefore numerical methods obtain approximate solutions different models use different solution methods some global models use spectral methods for the horizontal dimensions and finite difference methods for the vertical dimension while regional models and other global models usually use finite difference methods in all three dimensions 58 techniques edit persistence edit the simplest method of forecasting the weather persistence relies upon conditions to forecast the conditions tomorrow this can be a valid way of forecasting the weather when it is in a steady state such as during the summer season in the tropics this method of forecasting strongly depends upon the presence of a stagnant weather pattern therefore when in a fluctuating weather pattern this method of forecasting becomes inaccurate it can be useful in both short range forecasts and long range forecasts 60 use of a barometer edit measurements of barometric pressure and the pressure tendency the change of pressure over time have been used in forecasting since the late 19th century 61 the larger the change in pressure especially if more than 3.5 hpa 2.6 mmhg the larger the change in weather can be expected if the pressure drop is rapid a low pressure system is approaching and there is a greater chance of rain rapid pressure rises are associated with improving weather conditions such as clearing skies 62 looking at the sky edit marestail shows moisture at high altitude signalling the later arrival of wet weather along with pressure tendency the condition of the sky is one of the more important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is indicative of rain in the near future at night high thin cirrostratus clouds can lead to halos around the moon which indicates an approach of a warm front and its associated rain 63 morning fog portends fair conditions as rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds that prevent fog formation the approach of a line of thunderstorms could indicate the approach of a cold front cloud free skies are indicative of fair weather for the near future 64 a bar can indicate a coming tropical cyclone the use of sky cover in weather prediction has led to various weather lore over the centuries 65 nowcasting edit main article nowcasting meteorology the forecasting of the weather within the next six hours is often referred to as nowcasting 66 in this time range it is possible to forecast smaller features such as individual showers and thunderstorms with reasonable accuracy as well as other features too small to be resolved by a computer model a human given the latest radar satellite and observational data will be able to make a better analysis of the small scale features present and so will be able to make a more accurate forecast for the following few hours 67 however there are now expert systems using those data and mesoscale numerical model to make better extrapolation including evolution of those features in time use of forecast models edit an example of 500 mbar geopotential height prediction from a numerical weather prediction model in the past the human forecaster was responsible for generating the entire weather forecast based upon available observations 68 today human input is generally confined to choosing a model based on various parameters such as model biases and performance 69 using a consensus of forecast models as well as ensemble members of the various models can help reduce forecast error 70 however regardless how small the average error becomes with any individual system large errors within any particular piece of guidance are still possible on any given model run 71 humans are required to interpret the model data into weather forecasts that are understandable to the end user humans can use knowledge of local effects that may be too small in size to be resolved by the model to add information to the forecast while increasing accuracy of forecast models implies that humans may no longer be needed in the forecast process at some point in the future there is currently still a need for human intervention 72 analog technique edit the analog technique is a complex way of making a forecast requiring the forecaster to remember a previous weather event that is expected to be mimicked by an upcoming event what makes it a difficult technique to use is that there is rarely a perfect analog for an event in the future 73 some call this type of forecasting pattern recognition it remains a useful method of observing rainfall over data voids such as oceans 74 as well as the forecasting of precipitation amounts and distribution in the future a similar technique is used in medium range forecasting which is known as teleconnections when systems in other locations are used to help pin down the location of another system within the surrounding regime 75 an example of teleconnections are by using el oscillation enso related phenomena 76 quality assessment edit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it december 2016 mathematical models are often developed to map the forecast skill of a weather prediction methodology communicating forecasts to the public edit an example of a two day weather forecast in the visual style that an american newspaper might use temperatures are given in fahrenheit most end users of forecasts are members of the general public thunderstorms can create strong winds and dangerous lightning strikes that can lead to deaths power outages 77 and widespread hail damage heavy snow or rain can bring transportation and commerce to a stand still 78 as well as cause flooding in low lying areas 79 excessive heat or cold waves can sicken or kill those with inadequate utilities and droughts can impact water usage and destroy vegetation several countries employ government agencies to provide forecasts and watches warnings advisories to the public in order to protect life and property and maintain commercial interests knowledge of what the end user needs from a weather forecast must be taken into account to present the information in a useful and understandable way examples include the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s national weather service nws 80 and environment canada s meteorological service msc 81 traditionally newspaper television and radio have been the primary outlets for presenting weather forecast information to the public increasingly the internet is being used due to the vast amount of specific information that can be found 82 in all cases these outlets update their forecasts on a regular basis severe weather alerts and advisories edit a major part of modern weather forecasting is the severe weather alerts and advisories that the national weather services issue in the case that severe or hazardous weather is expected this is done to protect life and property 83 some of the most commonly known of severe weather advisories are the severe thunderstorm and tornado warning as well as the severe thunderstorm and tornado watch other forms of these advisories include winter weather high wind flood tropical cyclone and fog 84 severe weather advisories and alerts are broadcast through the media including radio using emergency systems as the emergency alert system which break into regular programming 85 low temperature forecast edit the low temperature forecast for the current day is calculated using the lowest temperature found between 7pm that evening through 7am the following morning 86 so in short forecasted low is most likely low temperature specialist forecasting edit there are a number of sectors with their own specific needs for weather forecasts and specialist services are provided to these users air traffic edit ash cloud from the 2008 eruption of volcano stretching across patagonia from the pacific to the atlantic ocean see also terminal aerodrome forecast because the aviation industry is especially sensitive to the weather accurate weather forecasting is essential fog or exceptionally low ceilings can prevent many aircraft from landing and taking off 87 turbulence and icing are also significant in flight hazards 88 thunderstorms are a problem for all aircraft because of severe turbulence due to their updrafts and outflow boundaries 89 icing due to the heavy precipitation as well as large hail strong winds and lightning all of which can cause severe damage to an aircraft in flight 90 volcanic ash is also a significant problem for aviation as aircraft can lose engine power within ash clouds 91 on a day to day basis airliners are routed to take advantage of the jet stream tailwind to improve fuel efficiency 92 aircrews are briefed prior to takeoff on the conditions to expect en route and at their destination 93 additionally airports often change which runway is being used to take advantage of a headwind this reduces the distance required for takeoff and eliminates potential crosswinds 94 marine edit see also marine weather forecasting commercial and recreational use of waterways can be limited significantly by wind direction and speed wave periodicity and heights tides and precipitation these factors can each influence the safety of marine transit consequently a variety of codes have been established to efficiently transmit detailed marine weather forecasts to vessel pilots via radio for example the mafor marine forecast 95 typical weather forecasts can be received at sea through the use of rtty navtex and radiofax agriculture edit farmers rely on weather forecasts to decide what work to do on any particular day for example drying hay is only feasible in dry weather prolonged periods of dryness can ruin cotton wheat 96 and corn crops while corn crops can be ruined by drought their dried remains can be used as a cattle feed substitute in the form of silage 97 frosts and freezes play havoc with crops both during the spring and fall for example peach trees in full bloom can have their potential peach crop decimated by a spring freeze 98 orange groves can suffer significant damage during frosts and freezes regardless of their timing 99 forestry edit weather forecasting of wind precipitations and humidity is essential for preventing and controlling wildfires different indices like the forest fire weather index and the haines index have been developed to predict the areas more at risk to experience fire from natural or human causes conditions for the development of harmful insects can be predicted by forecasting the evolution of weather too utility companies edit an air handling unit is used for the heating and cooling of air in a central location click on image for legend main article degree day electricity and gas companies rely on weather forecasts to anticipate demand which can be strongly affected by the weather they use the quantity termed the degree day to determine how strong of a use there will be for heating heating degree day or cooling cooling degree day these quantities are based on a daily average temperature of cooler temperatures force heating degree days one per degree fahrenheit while warmer temperatures force cooling degree days 100 in winter severe cold weather can cause a surge in demand as people turn up their heating 101 similarly in summer a surge in demand can be linked with the increased use of air conditioning systems in hot weather 102 by anticipating a surge in demand utility companies can purchase additional supplies of power or natural gas before the price increases or in some circumstances supplies are restricted through the use of brownouts and blackouts 103 other commercial companies edit increasingly private companies pay for weather forecasts tailored to their needs so that they can increase their profits or avoid large losses 104 for example supermarket chains may change the stocks on their shelves in anticipation of different consumer spending habits in different weather conditions weather forecasts can be used to invest in the commodity market such as futures in oranges corn soybeans and oil 105
