american rockwell principal assembly facility in palmdale california a suburb of los angeles columbia was named after the american sloop columbia rediviva which from 1787 to 1793 under the command of captain robert gray explored the us pacific northwest and became the first american vessel to circumnavigate the globe it is also named after the command module of apollo 11 the first manned landing on another celestial body 3 columbia was also the female symbol of the united states after construction the orbiter arrived at kennedy space center on march 25 1979 to prepare for its first launch columbia was originally scheduled to lift off in late 1979 however the launch date was delayed by problems with both the ssme components as well as the thermal protection system tps 4 on march 19 1981 during preparations for a ground test workers were asphyxiated while working in nitrogen purged aft engine compartment resulting in variously reported two or three fatalities 5 6 columbia in the orbiter processing facility after delivery to kennedy space center in 1979 about 8 thousand of 30,000 tiles still had to be installed 7 the first flight of columbia sts 1 was commanded by john young a veteran from the gemini and apollo programs who was the ninth person to walk on the moon in 1972 and piloted by robert crippen a rookie astronaut originally selected to fly on the manned orbital laboratory mol spacecraft but transferred to nasa after its cancellation and served as a support crew member for the skylab and apollo soyuz missions columbia spent 610 days in the orbiter processing facility opf another 35 days in the vehicle assembly building vab and 105 days on pad 39a before finally lifting off 4 columbia was successfully launched on april 12 1981 the 20th anniversary of the first human spaceflight vostok 1 and returned on april 14 1981 after orbiting the earth 36 times landing on the dry lakebed runway at edwards air force base in california columbia then undertook three further research missions to test its technical characteristics and performance its first operational mission with a four man crew was sts 5 which launched on november 11 1982 at this point columbia was joined by challenger which flew the next three shuttle missions while columbia underwent modifications for the first spacelab mission columbia astronauts thomas k mattingly and pilot henry hartsfield salute president ronald reagan standing beside his wife nancy upon landing in 1982 in 1983 columbia under the command of john young on what was his sixth spaceflight undertook its second operational mission sts 9 in which the spacelab science laboratory and a six person crew was carried including the first non american astronaut on a space shuttle ulf merbold after the flight columbia spent 18 months at the rockwell palmdale facility beginning in january 1984 undergoing modifications that removed the orbiter flight test hardware and bringing it up to similar specifications as those of its sister orbiters at that time the shuttle fleet was expanded to include discovery and atlantis columbia returned to space on january 12 1986 with the launch of sts 61 c the crew included dr franklin chang diaz as well as the first sitting member of the house of representatives to venture into space bill nelson the next shuttle mission sts 51 l was undertaken by challenger it was launched on january 28 1986 ten days after sts 61 c had landed and ended in disaster 73 seconds after launch in the aftermath shuttle timetable was disrupted and columbia was not flown again until 1989 on sts 28 after which it resumed normal service as part of the shuttle fleet sts 93 launched on july 23 1999 was the first u s space mission with a female commander lt col eileen collins this mission deployed the chandra x ray observatory columbia s final successful mission was sts 109 the fourth servicing mission for the hubble space telescope its next mission sts 107 culminated in the loss when it disintegrated during reentry killing all seven of its crew consequently president bush decided to retire the shuttle orbiter fleet by 2010 in favor of the constellation program and its manned orion spacecraft the constellation program was later cancelled with the nasa authorization act of 2010 signed by president obama on october 11 construction milestones edit date milestone 8 july 26 1972

this template message columbia launching during sts 1 its distinctive black chines and usa painted on the starboard wing are visible columbia was the only orbiter launched with its external tank painted white which was later discontinued to save weight weight edit as the second orbiter to be constructed and the first able to fly into space columbia was roughly heavier than subsequent orbiters such as endeavour which were of a slightly different design and had benefited from advances in materials technology 9 in part this was due to heavier wing and fuselage spars the weight of early test instrumentation that remained fitted to the avionics suite and an internal airlock that originally fitted into the other orbiters was later removed in favor of an external airlock to facilitate shuttle mir and shuttle international space station dockings 10 due to its weight columbia could not have used the planned centaur g booster cancelled after the loss of challenger 11 the retention of the internal airlock allowed nasa to use columbia for the sts 109 hubble space telescope servicing mission along with the spacehab double module used on sts 107 due to heavier weight it was less ideal for nasa to use it for missions to the international space station though modifications were made to the shuttle during its last refit in case the spacecraft was needed for such tasks thermal protection system edit externally columbia was the first orbiter in the fleet whose surface was mostly covered with high low temperature reusable surface insulation hrsi lrsi tiles as its main thermal protection system tps with white silicone rubber painted nomex known as felt reusable surface insulation frsi blankets in some areas on the wings fuselage and payload bay doors frsi once covered almost 25% of the orbiter the first upgrade resulted in its removal from many areas and in later flights it was only used on the upper section of the payload bay doors and inboard sections of the upper wing surfaces 12 the upgrade also involved replacing many of the white lrsi tiles on the upper surfaces with advanced flexible reusable surface insulation afrsi blankets also known as fibrous insulation blankets or fibs that had been used on discovery and atlantis originally columbia had 32,000 tiles the upgrade reduced this to 24,300 the afrsi blankets consisted of layers of pure silica felt sandwiched between a layer of silica fabric on the outside and s glass fabric on the inside stitched together using pure silica thread in a 1 inch grid then coated with a high purity silica coating the blankets were semi rigid and could be made as large as 30 by 30 each blanket replaced as many as 25 tiles and was bonded directly to the orbiter 12 the direct application of the blankets to the orbiter resulted in weight reduction improved durability reduced fabrication and installation cost and reduced installation schedule time 13 all of this work was performed during first retrofitting and the post challenger stand down columbia landing at edwards air force base following sts 28 despite refinements to the thermal protection system and other enhancements columbia would never weigh as little unloaded as the other orbiters in the fleet the next oldest shuttle challenger was also relatively heavy although lighter than columbia markings and insignia edit until its last refit columbia was the only operational orbiter with wing markings consisting of an american flag on the port left wing and the letters usa on the starboard right wing challenger discovery atlantis and endeavour all until 1998 bore markings consisting of the letters usa below an american flag on the left wing and the pre 1998 nasa worm logo afore the respective name on the right wing enterprise the test vehicle which was the prototype for columbia originally had the same wing markings as columbia but with the letters usa on the right wing spaced closer together enterprise s markings were modified to match challenger in 1983 the name of the orbiter was originally placed on the payload bay doors much like enterprise but was placed on the crew cabin after the challenger disaster so that the orbiter could be easily identified while in orbit from its last refit to its destruction columbia bore markings identical to those of its operational sister orbiters the nasa meatball logo on the left wing and the american flag afore the name on the right only distinctive wing chines remained these black areas on the upper surfaces of the forward wing were added because at first shuttle designers did not know how reentry heating would affect the upper wing surfaces citation needed the chines allowed columbia to be easily recognized at a distance as opposed to the subsequent orbiters the chines were added after columbia arrived at ksc in 1979 silts pod edit another unique external feature termed the silts pod was located on the top of vertical stabilizer and was installed after sts 9 to acquire infrared and other thermal data though the equipment was removed after initial tests nasa decided to leave it in place mainly to save costs along with the plans to use it for future experiments the vertical stabilizer was later modified to incorporate the drag chute first used on endeavour in 1992 other upgrades edit columbia landing at the kennedy space center following sts 62 columbia was also originally fitted with lockheed built ejection seats identical to those found on the sr 71 blackbird these were active for the four orbital test flights but deactivated after sts 4 and removed entirely after sts 9 columbia was also the only spaceworthy orbiter not delivered with head up displays for the commander and pilot although these were incorporated after sts 9 like its sister ships columbia was eventually retrofitted with the new meds glass cockpit display and lightweight seats future edit space shuttle columbia launches on sts 109 hst 3b its final successful mission had columbia not been destroyed it would have been fitted with the external airlock docking adapter for sts 118 an international space station assembly mission originally planned for november 2003 columbia was scheduled for this mission due to discovery being out of service for its orbital maintenance down period and because the iss assembly schedule could not be adhered to with only endeavour and atlantis columbia career would have started to wind down after sts 118 it was to service the hubble space telescope two more times between 2004 and 2005 but no more missions were planned for it again except for a mission designated sts 144 where it would retrieve the hubble space telescope from orbit and bring it back to earth citation needed following the columbia accident nasa flew the sts 125 mission using atlantis combining the planned fourth and fifth servicing missions into one final mission to hubble because of the retirement of the space shuttle fleet the batteries and gyroscopes that keep the telescope pointed will eventually fail also because of the magnifier screen which would result in its reentry and break up in atmosphere a soft capture docking mechanism based on the docking adapter that was to be used on the orion spacecraft was installed during the last servicing mission in anticipation of this event columbia was also scheduled to launch the x 38 v 201 crew return vehicle prototype as the next mission after sts 118 until the cancellation of the project in 2002 citation needed flights edit columbia flew 28 missions gathering 300.74 days spent in space with 4,808 orbits and a total distance of 125,204,911 miles up until sts 107 despite being in service during the shuttle mir and international space station programs columbia did not fly any missions that visited a space station the other three active orbiters at the time had visited both mir and the iss at least once columbia was not suited for high inclination missions date designation

october 2001 from left to right brown husband clark chawla anderson mccool ramon columbia memorial in arlington national cemetery columbia was destroyed at about 09 00 est on february 1 2003 while re entering the atmosphere after a 16 day scientific mission the columbia accident investigation board determined that a hole was punctured in the leading edge on one of wings made of a carbon composite the hole had formed when a piece of insulating foam from the external fuel tank peeled off during the launch 16 days earlier and struck the left wing during the intense heat of re entry hot gases penetrated the interior of the wing likely compromising the hydraulic system and leading to control failure of the control surfaces the resulting loss of control exposed minimally protected areas of the orbiter to full entry heating and dynamic pressures that eventually led to vehicle break up 14 the nearly 84,000 pieces of collected debris of the vessel are stored in a 16th floor office suite in the vehicle assembly building at the kennedy space center the collection was opened to the media once and has since been open only to researchers 15 16 unlike challenger which had a replacement

museum the debris field encompassed hundreds of miles across northeast texas and into louisiana the nose cap and remains of all seven crew members were found in sabine county east texas to honor those who lost their lives aboard the shuttle and during the recovery efforts the patricia huffman smith nasa museum remembering columbia was opened in hemphill sabine county texas the museum tells the story of space shuttle columbia explorations throughout all its missions including the final sts 107 its exhibits also show the efforts of local citizens during the recovery period of the columbia shuttle debris and its remains an area is dedicated to each sts 107 crew member and also to the texas forest service helicopter pilot who died in the recovery effort the museum houses many objects and artifacts from nasa and its contractors the families of the sts 107 crew and other individuals the families contributed personal items of the crew members to be on permanent display the museum features two interactive simulator displays that emulate activities of the shuttle and orbiter the digital learning center and its classroom provide educational opportunities for all ages 18 columbia memorial space center the columbia memorial space center is the u s national memorial for the space shuttle seven crew members it is located in downey on the site of the space origins and production the former north american aviation plant in los angeles county southern california the facility is also a hands on learning center with interactive exhibits workshops and classes about space science astronautics and the space shuttle legacy providing educational opportunities for all ages 19 naming dedications the final crew was honored in 2003 when the united states board on geographic names approved the name columbia point for a 13 980 foot mountain in sangre de cristo mountains less than a half mile from challenger point a peak named after other lost shuttle the columbia hills on mars were also named in honor of the crew and a host of other memorials were dedicated in various forms the columbia supercomputer at the nasa advanced supercomputing nas division located at ames research center in california was named in honor of the crew lost in the 2003 disaster built as a joint effort between nasa and technical partners sgi and intel in 2004 the supercomputer was used in scientific research of space the climate and aerodynamic design of space launch vehicles and aircraft 20 the first part of the system built in 2003 was dedicated to sts 107 astronaut and engineer kalpana chawla who prior to joining the space shuttle program worked at ames research center 21 media tributes edit guitarist steve morse of the rock band deep purple wrote the instrumental contact lost in response to the news of the tragedy recorded by deep purple and featured as the closing track on their 2003 album bananas it was dedicated to the astronauts whose lives were lost in the disaster morse donated songwriting royalties to the families of lost astronauts 22 astronaut and mission specialist engineer kalpana chawla one of the victims of the accident was a fan of deep purple and had exchanged e mails with the band during the flight making the tragedy even more personal for the group 22 she took three cds into space with her two of which were deep purple albums machine head and purpendicular both cds survived the destruction of the shuttle and the 39 mile plunge 23 the musical group children included singer songwriter cat columbia on their final album from the hazel tree 24 the long winters 2005 album ultimatum features the song the commander thinks aloud a tribute to the final columbia crew 25 the eric johnson instrumental columbia from his 2005 album bloom was written as a commemoration and tribute to the lives that were lost johnson said i wanted to make it more of a positive message a salute a celebration rather than just concentrating on a few moments of tragedy but instead the bigger picture of these brave lives 26 the graphic novel orbiter by warren ellis and colleen doran was dedicated to the lives memories and legacies of the seven astronauts lost on space shuttle columbia during mission sts 107 laurel clark wake up call on sts 107 was runrig running to the light laurel took the stamping ground cd into space with her and when the shuttle exploded the cd was found back on earth and presented to the band the bands last studio album the story final track somewhere ends with a recording of her voice introducing the song popular culture edit fans of the original star trek television series were largely responsible for nasa naming the first space shuttle enterprise in the television series star trek enterprise both the first and second starships of the human built nx class registry numbers nx 01 nx 02 respectively were named in honor of pre existing nasa space shuttles the second name was first revealed in the season 3 episode to be columbia in honor of the space shuttle columbia following its destruction on february 1 2003 the uniforms on nx 02 columbia bear a crew patch depicting 7 stars in honor of the astronauts who died in the accident in red and blue and yellow a model of the space shuttle can be seen on the second floor of the pewter city museum while columbia was identified by name in the original games in the 2004 remakes firered and leafgreen the model was simply identified as space shuttle the 2016 release for 3ds did not censor the name a restored columbia was used in episode 19 wild horses of the anime cowboy bebop
