launch humans into space nasa administrator t keith glennan and his deputy administrator dr hugh dryden discussed whether spacecraft crew members should be called astronauts or cosmonauts dryden preferred cosmonaut on the grounds that flights would occur in the cosmos near space while the astro prefix suggested flight to the stars most nasa space task group members preferred astronaut which survived by common usage as the preferred american term 12 when the soviet union launched the first man into space yuri gagarin in 1961 they chose a term which anglicizes to cosmonaut english in english speaking nations a professional space traveler is called an astronaut 13 the term derives from the greek words meaning star and nautes meaning sailor the first known use of the term astronaut in the modern sense was by neil r jones in his short story the head meteor in 1930 the word itself had been known earlier for example in percy greg s 1880 book across the zodiac astronaut referred to a spacecraft in les navigateurs de 1925 of j h rosny the word astronautique astronautic was used the word may have been inspired by aeronaut an older term for an air traveler first applied in 1784 to balloonists an early use in a non fiction publication is eric frank russell s poem the astronaut in the november 1934 bulletin of the british interplanetary society 14 the first known formal use of the term astronautics in the scientific community was the establishment of the annual international astronautical congress in 1950 and the subsequent founding of the international astronautical federation the following year 15 nasa applies the term astronaut to any crew member aboard nasa spacecraft bound for earth orbit or beyond nasa also uses the term as a title for those selected to join its astronaut corps 16 the european space agency similarly uses the term astronaut for members of its astronaut corps 17 russian main article soviet space program see also list of cosmonauts by convention an astronaut employed by the russian federal space agency or its soviet predecessor is called a cosmonaut in english texts 16 the word is an anglicisation of the russian word kosmonavt russian russian pronunciation one who works in space outside the atmosphere a space traveler 18 which derives from the greek words kosmos meaning universe and nautes meaning sailor other countries of the former eastern bloc use variations of the russian word kosmonavt such as the polish kosmonauta coinage of the term kosmonavt has been credited to soviet aeronautics pioneer mikhail tikhonravov 19 20 the first cosmonaut was soviet air force pilot yuri gagarin also the first person in space valentina tereshkova a russian factory worker was the first woman in space as well as the first civilian

phrase spaceman is often used in hong kong and taiwan 23 the term taikonaut is used by some english language news media organizations for professional space travelers from china 24 the word has featured in the longman and oxford english dictionaries the latter of which describes it as a hybrid of the chinese term taikong space and the greek naut sailor the term became more common in 2003 when china sent its first astronaut yang liwei into space aboard the shenzhou 5 spacecraft 25 this is the term used by xinhua news agency in the english version of the chinese daily since the advent of the chinese space program 26 the origin of the term is unclear as early as may 1998 chiew lee yih from malaysia used it in newsgroups 27 28 other terms with the rise of space tourism nasa and the russian federal space agency agreed to use the term spaceflight participant to distinguish those space travelers from professional astronauts on missions coordinated by those two agencies while no nation other than the russian federation and previously the former soviet union the united states and china have launched a manned spacecraft several other nations have sent people into space in cooperation with one of these countries inspired partly by these missions other synonyms for astronaut have entered occasional english usage for example the term spationaut french spelling spationaute is sometimes used to describe french space travelers from the latin word spatium for space the malay term angkasawan was used to describe participants in the angkasawan program and the indian space

biomedical research institute nsbri to address these issues prominent among these is the advanced diagnostic ultrasound in microgravity study in which astronauts including former iss commanders leroy chiao and gennady padalka perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts to diagnose and potentially treat hundreds of medical conditions in space this techniques are now being applied to cover professional and olympic sports injuries as well as ultrasound performed by non expert operators in medical and high school students it is anticipated that remote guided ultrasound will have application on earth in emergency and rural care situations where access to a trained physician is often rare 76 77 78 a 2006 space shuttle experiment found that salmonella typhimurium a bacterium that can cause food poisoning became more virulent when cultivated in space 79 more recently in 2017 bacteria were found to be more resistant to antibiotics and to thrive in the near weightlessness of space 80 microorganisms have been observed to survive the vacuum of outer space 81 82 on december 31 2012 a nasa supported study reported that manned spaceflight may harm the brain and accelerate the onset of disease 83 84 85 in october 2015 the nasa office of inspector general issued a health hazards report related to space exploration including a human mission to mars 86 87 over the last decade

each meal weighs around 0.12 kilograms 0.27 pounds longer duration missions require more food shuttle astronauts worked with nutritionists to select menus that appeal to their individual tastes five months before flight menus are selected and analyzed for nutritional content by the shuttle dietician foods are tested to see how they will react in a reduced gravity environment caloric requirements are determined using a basal energy expenditure bee formula on earth the average american uses about 35 gallons 132 liters of water every day on board the iss astronauts limit water use to only about three gallons 11 liters per day 90 insignia in russia cosmonauts are awarded pilot cosmonaut of the russian federation upon completion of their missions often accompanied with the award of hero of the
