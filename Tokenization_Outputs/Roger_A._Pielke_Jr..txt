the space station program 9 pielke has also written extensively on climate change policy he has written that he accepts the ipcc view of the underlying science stating the ipcc has concluded that greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activity are an important driver of changes in climate and on this basis alone i am personally convinced that it makes sense to take action to limit greenhouse gas emissions 10 he also states that any conceivable emissions reductions policies even if successful cannot have a perceptible impact on the climate for many decades and from this he concludes that in coming decades the only policies that can effectively be used to manage the immediate effects of climate variability and change will be adaptive 11 12 on the issues of hurricanes and climate change he has argued that the trend in increasing damage from hurricanes is primarily due to societal and economic factors chiefly an increase in wealth density rather than change in the frequency and intensity 13 pielke has been labeled a skeptic and denier of climate change though pielke strongly objects to those labels 14 his views on climate change have been widely criticized by

scientists michael mann and kevin trenberth criticized as deeply misleading and demonstrably wrong in interviews with thinkprogress 24 the scientists said that pielke sent them threatening e mails in response to their criticism calling it libelous pielke responded that their characterization of his e mails as threatening was ridiculous legum told the huffington post that he contacted nate silver the editor of fivethirtyeight which apologized to the two scientists for behavior 22 other criticisms of article followed 25 the guardian published an article by dana nuccitelli called fivethirtyeight

communications related to research and congressional testimony the letter was one of seven grijalva sent to various institutions stemming from concerns about the influence of funding from fossil fuel companies on the work and testimony of harvard smithsonian center for astrophysics researcher willie soon pielke responded that he has no funding from fossil fuel interests and characterized the letter as part of a politically motivated witch hunt 31 in response to criticism that requesting communications was counter to principles of academic freedom grijalva said he was willing to eliminate that part of the request 32 the heads of some mainstream scientific organizations criticized letters margaret leinen the president of the american geophysical union posted in her agu blog that in requiring information only of a few scientists based only on their scientific views action was contrary to academic freedom view the singling out of any individual or group of scientists by any entity governmental corporate or other based solely on their interpretations of scientific research as a threat to that 33 the executive director of the american meteorological society wrote in a letter to grvalja that his action a chilling message to all academic and on the free pursuit of ideas that is central to the concept of academic 34 conservative columnist rich lowry editor of the national review noted in an opinion piece that not that he pielke doubts climate change or even doubts that it could be harmful his offense is merely pointing to data showing that extreme weather events like hurricanes tornadoes and droughts yet been affected by climate change this is enough to enrage advocates who need immediate disasters as a handy political cudgel 35 pielke was also named in a letter sent by senator edward markey to numerous energy industry groups asking them to disclose the names of scientists they had funded regarding conflict of interest disclosures pielke said that if you look at our community the failure to disclose conflicts of interest is fairly endemic 36 publications edit editor with daniel sarewitz and radford byerly jr prediction science decision making and the
