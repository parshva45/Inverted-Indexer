baikonur cosmodrome russian kosmodrom baykonur kazakh is a spaceport located in southern kazakhstan baikonur cosmodrome is the first and largest operational space launch facility 1 the spaceport is located in the desert steppe of baikonur about 200 kilometres east of the aral sea and north of the river syr darya it is near the tyuratam railway station and is about 90 metres above sea level the spaceport is currently leased by the kazakh government to russia until 2050 and is managed jointly by the roscosmos state corporation and the russian aerospace forces the shape of the area leased is an ellipse measuring 90 kilometres by 85 kilometres with the cosmodrome at the centre it was originally built by the soviet union in the late 1950s as the base of operations for the soviet space program under the current russian space program baikonur remains a busy spaceport with numerous commercial military and scientific missions being launched annually 2 3 all crewed russian spaceflights are launched from baikonur 4 both sputnik 1 the first artificial satellite and vostok 1 the first human spaceflight were launched from baikonur the launch pad used for both missions was renamed start

russian poligon n 5 on 12 february 1955 it was actually founded on 2 june 1955 originally a test center for the first intercontinental ballistic missile icbm 5 the r 7 semyorka niip 5 was soon expanded to include launch facilities for space flights the site was selected by a commission led by gen vasily voznyuk influenced by sergey korolyov the chief designer of the r 7 icbm and soon the man behind the soviet space program it had to be surrounded by plains as the radio control system of the rocket required at the time receiving uninterrupted signals from ground stations hundreds of kilometres away 6 additionally the missile trajectory had to be away from populated areas also it is an advantage to place a space launch site closer to the equator as the surface of the earth has higher rotational speed there taking these constraints into consideration the commission chose tyuratam a village in the heart of the kazakh steppe the expense of constructing the launch facilities and the several hundred kilometres of new road and train lines made the cosmodrome one of the most costly infrastructure projects the soviets undertook citation needed a supporting town was built around the facility to provide housing schools and infrastructure for workers it was raised to city status in 1966 and named leninsk the american u 2 high altitude reconnaissance plane found and photographed the tyuratam missile test range for the first time on 5 august 1957 name edit there are conflicting sources about origins of the name baikonur some sources say that it was not until 1961 i e until flight when the name was deliberately chosen to misdirect 6 7 the west to a place about 320 kilometres northeast of the launch center the small mining town of baikonur near jezkazgan other sources state that baikonur was name of the tyuratam region even before the cosmodrome existed 7 the main cosmodrome supporting town leninsk was renamed to baikonur on 20 december 1995 by boris yeltsin environmental impact edit russian scientist afanasiy ilich tobonov researched mass animal deaths in the 1990s and concluded that the mass deaths of birds and wildlife in the sakha republic were noted only along the flight paths of space rockets launched from the baikonur cosmodrome 8 dead wildlife and livestock were usually incinerated and the participants in these incinerations including tobonov himself his brothers and inhabitants of his native village of eliptyan commonly died from stroke or cancer in 1997 the ministry of defense of the russian federation changed the flight path and removed the ejected rocket stages near nyurbinsky district russia citation needed scientific literature collected enough data that confirmed adverse effects of rockets on environment and health of the population 9 heptyl or udmh a fuel used in russian rocket engines is considered to be highly toxic it is one of the reasons for acid rains and cancers in the local population near the cosmodrome valery yakovlev a head of the laboratory of ecosystem research of the state scientific production union of applied ecology kazmechanobr notes scientists have established the extreme character of destructive influence of baikonur space center on environment and population of the region 11 000 tons of space scrap metal polluted by especially toxic heptyl is still laying on the falling grounds 10 importance edit many historic flights lifted off from baikonur the first operational icbm the first man made satellite sputnik 1 on 4 october 1957 the first spacecraft to travel close to the moon luna 1 on 2 january 1959 the first manned and orbital flight by yuri gagarin on 12 april 1961 and the flight of the first woman in space valentina tereshkova in 1963 14 cosmonauts of 13 other nations such as czechoslovakia east germany india and france started their journeys from here as well under the interkosmos program in 1960 a prototype r 16 icbm exploded before launch killing over 100 people baikounr is also the site where venera 9 and mars 3 were launched from russian era edit a soyuz rocket is erected into position at the baikonur pad 1/5 start on 24 march 2009 the rocket launched the crew of expedition 19 and a spaceflight participant on 26 march 2009 11 following the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 the russian space program continued to operate from baikonur under the auspices of the commonwealth of independent states russia wanted to sign a 99 year lease for baikonur but agreed to a $115 million annual lease of the site for 20 years with an option for a 10 year extension 12 on 8 june 2005 the russian federation council ratified an agreement between russia and kazakhstan extending rent term of the spaceport until 2050 the rent remained fixed at us 115 000 000 per year is the source of a long running dispute between the two countries 13 in an attempt to reduce its dependency on baikonur russia is constructing the vostochny cosmodrome in amur oblast 14 with the retirement of the american space shuttle program baikonur has been the only launch site for international space station missions using russian spacecraft 4 following the conclusion of the space shuttle program russian spacecraft are now the only means by which astronauts can travel to the international space station making baikonur the sole launch site used for manned missions to the iss 15 features edit baikonur is fully equipped with facilities for launching both manned and unmanned spacecraft it supports several generations of russian spacecraft soyuz proton tsyklon dnepr zenit and buran during the temporary lapse of the united states space shuttle program after the columbia disaster in 2003 it played an essential role in operating and resupplying of the international space station iss with soyuz and progress spacecraft its high latitude of n required the high orbital inclination of the iss 16 downrange from the launchpad spent launch equipment is

edit main article buran program as part of the buran program several facilities were adapted or newly built for the buran class space shuttle orbiters site 110 used for the launch of the buran class orbiters like the assembly and processing hall at site 112 the launch complex was originally constructed for the soviet lunar landing program and later converted for the energia buran program site 112 used for orbiter maintenance and to mate the orbiters to their energia launchers thus fulfilling a role similar to the vab at ksc the main hangar at the site called mik rn or mik 112 was originally built for the assembly of the n1 moon rocket after cancellation of the n 1 program in 1974 the facilities at site 112 were converted for the energia buran program it was here that orbiter k1 was stored after the end of the buran program and was destroyed when the hangar roof collapsed in 2002 18 19 site 251 used as buran orbiter landing facility also known as yubileyniy airfield and fulfilling a role similar to the slf at ksc it features one runway called 06/24 which is 4,500 metres long and 84 metres wide paved with grade 600 high quality reinforced concrete at the edge of the runway was a special device designed to lift an orbiter off its antonov an 225 mriya carrier aircraft and load it on a transporter which would carry the orbiter to the processing building at site 254 a purpose built orbiter landing control facility housed in a large multi store office building was located near the runway yubileyniy airfield was also used to receive heavy transport planes carrying elements of the energia buran system after the end of the buran program site 251 was abandoned but later reopened as a commercial cargo airport besides serving baikonur kazakh authorities also use it for passenger and charter flights from russia 20 21 site 254 built to service the buran class orbiters between flights thus fulfilling a role similar to the opf at ksc constructed in the 1980s as a special four bay building it also featured a large processing area flanked by several floors of test rooms after cancellation of the buran program it was adapted for pre launch operations of the soyuz and progress spacecraft 22 baikonur railway edit soyuz tma 16 launch vehicle being transported to launchpad at baikonur in 2009 all logistics are based on its own intra site gauge railway network which is the largest industrial railway on the planet the railway is used for all stages of launch preparation and all spacecraft are transported to the launchpads by the special schnabel cars once part of the soviet railroad troops the baikonur railway is now served by a dedicated civilian state company there are several rail links connecting the baikonur railway to the public railway of kazakhstan and the rest of the world baikonur airports edit the baikonur cosmodrome has two on site multi purpose airports serving both the personnel transportation needs and the logistics of space launches including the delivery of the spacecraft by planes there are scheduled passenger services from moscow to the smaller krayniy airport iata bxy icao uaol which however are not accessible to the public the larger yubileyniy airport icao uaon was where the buran orbiter was transported to baikonur on the back of the antonov an 225 mriya cargo aircraft icbm testing edit although baikonur has always been known around the world as the launch site of soviet and russian space missions from its outset in 1955 and until the collapse of the ussr in 1991 the primary purpose of this center was to test liquid fueled ballistic missiles the official and secret name of the center was state test range no 5 or 5 gik it remained under control of the soviet and russian ministry of defense until the second half of the 1990s when the russian civilian space agency and its industrial contractors started taking over individual facilities citation needed in 2006 the head of roskosmos anatoly perminov said that the last russian military personnel would be removed from the baikonur facility by 2007 however on 22 october 2008 an ss 19 stiletto missile was test fired from baikonur indicating this may not be the case 23 future projects edit on 22 december 2004 kazakhstan and russia signed a contract establishing the baiterek jv joint venture in which each country holds a 50 percent stake the goal of the project is the construction of the bayterek poplar tree space launch complex to facilitate operations of the russian angara rocket launcher 24 this will allow launches with a payload of 26 tons to low earth orbit compared to 20 tons using the proton system an additional benefit will be that the angara uses kerosene as fuel and oxygen as the oxidiser which is less hazardous to the environment than the toxic fuels used by older boosters the total expenditure on the kazakh side will be $223 million over 19 years 25 as of 2010 the project was stalling due to insufficient funding it was thought that the project still had good chances to succeed because it will allow both parties russia and kazakhstan to continue the joint use of baikonur even after the vostochny cosmodrome is commissioned 26 the first scheduled launch of the baiterek rocket and space complex is scheduled for 2025 27 baikonur museum edit baikonur cosmodrome has a small museum next to two small cottages once residences of sergey korolev and yuri gagarin both cottages are part of the museum complex and have been preserved the museum is home to a collection of space artifacts a restored test artifact from the soviet buran programme sits next to the museum entrance the vehicle that flew a single orbital test mission in 1988 was destroyed in a hangar collapse in 2002 28 29 30 for a complete list of buran artifacts see buran spacecraft the museum also houses photographs related to the history including images of all cosmonauts every crew of every expedition launched from baikonur leaves behind a signed crew photograph that is displayed behind the glass museum holds many objects related to gagarin including the ground control panel from his flight his uniforms and soil from his landing site preserved in a silver container one of the museum rooms also holds an older version of the soyuz descent capsule in popular culture edit in star trek the next generation the baikonur cosmodrome was a federation
