connected to the north with albemarle sound through passages provided by the roanoke sound and croatan sound core sound is located at the narrow southern end 1 2 it is fed by the neuse and pamlico rivers the latter of which is the estuary of the tar river from the west and by oregon inlet hatteras inlet and ocracoke inlet which also provide passage to the atlantic ocean 5 the salinity of the sound averages 20 ppt compared to an average coastal salinity of 35 ppt in the atlantic and 3 ppt in the currituck sound which is located north of the albemarle sound 6 the sound and its ocean inlets are noted for wide expanses of shallow water and occasional shoaling making the area hazardous for larger vessels while the deepest hole of the estuary 26 can be found in the pamlico sound 7 depths generally range from 5 to 6 feet 8 in addition the shallow waters are susceptible to wind and barometric pressure driven tidal fluctuations this effect is amplified on the tributary rivers where water levels can change by as much as two feet in three hours when winds are aligned with the rivers axes and are blowing strongly 1 2 history and current use edit in march 1524 italian explorer giovanni da verrazzano mistook the sound for the pacific ocean because of its wide expanse and separation from the atlantic ocean by the outer banks barrier islands 5 the sound was named for the pamlico native american tribe that lived along the mainland banks and who were referred to as the pamouik by the raleigh expeditions circa 1584 9 three locations of pamlico sound in the outer banks between cape

fishing catches are attributed to the pamlico sound generating almost $100 million per year 13 wildlife edit along the coastal areas are numerous waterfowl nesting sites including pea island national wildlife refuge on the outer banks and swanquarter national wildlife refuge on the mainland 1 2 dolphins and sea turtles 14 are abundant 15 with occasional visits by seals such as harp seal in early january and february many other cetaceans including rare species such as fin whales beaked whales and orcas are present off outer banks and cape hatteras whales such as atlantic gray now extirpated 16 north atlantic right critically endangerend and north atlantic humpback were historically common endangered species such as leatherback turtles 17 great white sharks and basking sharks are also known
