sixth hurricane of the 1996 atlantic hurricane season hortense developed on from a tropical wave in the central atlantic ocean initially a tropical depression it headed westward without significant strengthening for four days due to unfavorable upper level winds while nearing the lesser antilles upper level winds decreased allowing the depression to become tropical storm hortense on hortense crossed guadeloupe on and entered the caribbean sea by on the following day it was upgraded to a hurricane while curving northwestward hortense made landfall in puerto rico on and brushed the dominican republic shortly thereafter after re entering the atlantic hortense began to substantially strengthen and peaked as a hurricane early on thereafter the storm steadily weakened as it tracked rapidly north northeastward early on hortense made landfall in nova scotia as a minimal hurricane it quickly weakened further to a tropical storm before re entering the atlantic to the south of newfoundland late on hortense transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and subsequently merged with a frontal system about later the storm produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds as it passed through the lesser antilles on guadeloupe damage was most significant to crops with over 50% of banana plantains destroyed localized flooding was reported on martinique impact was most significant in puerto rico across the island were severely damaged about people on puerto rico were left without electricity equivalent to about 40% of the population damage in puerto rico was estimated at 1996 usd there were also most of which due to drowning during flash floods in the dominican republic strong winds damaged a number of buildings and houses and downed several power lines flooding also forced the closure of several roads and impacted 80% of crops in province at least three fatalities were confirmed in that country the storm brought strong winds to the bahamas and turks and caicos islands and lesser winds to bermuda later in its duration hortense struck nova scotia bringing heavy rainfall and hurricane force winds to isolated locations there were many power outages trees blown down roofs torn away and roads damaged in the province new brunswick newfoundland and prince edward island were also impacted though not as severely as in nova scotia damage in atlantic canada reached

history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the scale a tropical wave and a broad low pressure area associated with it exited the west coast of africa near dakar senegal on the low pressure area which had deepened to 1,005 mbar 29.7 inhg by moved south of cape verde although deep convection was minimal on satellite imagery the system possessed a well defined low to mid level circulation after crossing several national oceanic and atmospheric administration buoys early on it was determined that the system developed into tropical depression eight at on that same day while located about halfway between cape verde and the lesser antilles under the influence of strong high pressure ridge the depression tracked almost due westward without significant intensification convection remained sporadic and disorganized with a reconnaissance flight finding a board circulation and a few squall on while nearing the leeward islands upper level winds reduced to a favorable level causing strengthening and allowing deep convection to increase 1 hurricane hortense making landfall in puerto rico on september 10 at on the depression had intensified into tropical storm hortense a reconnaissance flight around that time reported winds of confirming the storm was strengthening early on hortense struck guadeloupe with winds of shortly thereafter intensification slowed due to increased vertical wind shear by upper level short wave in the eastern caribbean sea convection diminished with satellite imagery showing a tropical cyclone with the low level circulation exposed the short wave soon left the area causing wind shear to decrease and convection quickly re developed by early on hortense was upgraded to a hurricane while curving northwestward around on the following day the storm made landfall near puerto rico with winds of 1 this made it the first hurricane landfall on the island since hurricane hugo in 1989 initially most tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated hortense would pass south of the island and instead strike the dominican republic 2 after two hours hortense emerged into the mona passage and brushed the eastern tip of dominican republic punta cana near the eastern tip of the country reported the calm of the eye on land interaction with hispaniola weakened the storm slightly though it would soon re strengthen 1 while tracking east of turks and caicos islands on hortense became a hurricane and then to a hurricane by early on the following day continuing to intensify hortense reached intensity on around that time a developing trough centered over the eastern united states caused the storm to curve almost due northward and accelerate at on hortense attained its peak intensity with a maximum sustained wind speed of and a minimum barometric pressure of after maintaining intensity for the storm weakened back to a hurricane while passing well east of bermuda hortense was downgraded to a hurricane early on later that day the storm weakened further to a hurricane early on hortense made its final landfall near west quoddy nova scotia with winds of hortense weakened over nova scotia and was a tropical storm when it re emerged into the atlantic less than nine hours after landfall by on hortense transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while just south of newfoundland the remnants merged with a frontal system on the following day 1 preparations edit shortly after hortense intensified into a tropical storm a tropical storm warning was issued by the respective governments from martinique to the united states virgin islands late on about before the puerto rico landfall a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was issued for puerto rico 1 however the watch was discontinued at on after the storm experienced increased wind shear in the region 2 at the same time a hurricane warning was left after having been issued for the british and united states virgin islands earlier at on about fifteen hours before a hurricane warning was issued in puerto rico 1 the downgrade of the warning on the island led residents to underestimate the threat 2 before hortense struck puerto rico the local national weather service office warned of the potential of rainfall exceeding with higher totals in the mountains 1 late on a hurricane warning was issued for portions of eastern dominican republic which was eventually extended along the northern coastline a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was issued for the north coast of haiti to st nicolas on a hurricane
