the 1932 atlantic hurricane season the 1932 cuba hurricane known also as the hurricane of santa cruz del sur 1 or the 1932 hurricane 2 was the deadliest and one of the most intense tropical cyclones in cuban history the only category 5 atlantic hurricane ever recorded in november the cyclone had a path through the caribbean sea atypical to most hurricanes developing late in the atlantic hurricane season the strong winds storm surge and rain devastated an extensive portion of central and eastern cuba where the storm was considered the worst natural disaster of the 20th century though the effects from the hurricane were concentrated primarily on cuba significant effects were also felt in the cayman islands and the bahamas with lesser effects felt elsewhere the tropical depression that would later develop into the destructive hurricane was first located east of the lesser antilles on and tracked westward into the caribbean sea reaching tropical storm strength the next day moving southwestward towards the southern portion of the caribbean the storm reached hurricane strength on before a period of rapid intensification ensued on the tropical cyclone reached its peak intensity as a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of the storm weakened to intensity while recurving northeast moving ashore province on with winds of after traversing the island the storm gradually weakened as it crossed the central bahamas islands and near bermuda on the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and dissipated the next day as an intensifying hurricane in the southern caribbean sea the storm moved near the netherlands antilles and colombia causing widespread effects a prolonged passage of curacao resulted in the damaging of the harbor fortification the storm lashed the coast of colombia with strong winds and torrential rainfall severely hampering the banana crop in the region and disrupting telecommunications several towns particularly those near the coast sustained significant infrastructural damage marked albeit localized damage to banana crops was also reported in jamaica where strong winds toppled numerous trees in open waters the track brought it across numerous shipping lanes largely disrupting shipping primarily in the central caribbean and damaging several ships contents 1 meteorological history 2 preparations and impact 2.1 caribbean sea

scale the hurricane can be traced back to a tropical depression first identified at 06 00 utc on by ship observations roughly east of guadeloupe 3 4 tracking generally westward the depression crossed the lesser antilles the next day between dominica and martinique 3 barometric pressures decrease to as much as 1008 mbar hpa 29.77 inhg in st lucia confirmed the presence of a developing tropical cyclone 1 shortly after traversing the islands the disturbance strengthened to tropical storm intensity at on 3 concurrently as the storm was gradually intensifying the tropical cyclone began to take an unusual course towards the southwest 4 on the storm intensified to hurricane status while north of the netherlands antilles 3 steadily strengthening the hurricane reached status on 3 during the day the storm passed approximately north of punta gallinas in colombia the northernmost extent of south america 4 however at the same time the hurricane curved towards the west causing the storm to move away from colombia and venezuela 3 during the next few days the hurricane rapidly intensified reaching major hurricane status late on the next day the intensity was analyzed to have been the equivalent of a modern day hurricane while curving northward 3 although the storm was analyzed operationally to have maximized as a hurricane reanalysis of the hurricane indicated that the tropical cyclone was much more intense than suggested initially based on observations by the s s phemius the crew of which visually estimated winds of around at the maximum of the storm and measured unusually low pressures 1 early on the hurricane peaked with maximum sustained winds estimated at 3 during that time the s s phemius recorded a minimum barometric pressure of hpa this measurement was the lowest documented throughout the existence as this report did not occur within the eye the true minimum pressure may have been much less 1 pacing northward the hurricane gradually weakened after maximum intensity on but held its strength for hours before finally dropping to status 3 due to a gradual curve towards the northeast the hurricane tracked near cayman brac on 1 a minimum barometric pressure of hpa was documented on the island only slight weakening occurred before the hurricane made landfall on the caribbean coast of province at that day at the time of landfall the tropical cyclone was estimated to have had a minimum pressure of hpa and maximum sustained winds of with these winds extending as far as from the center of the hurricane the storm traversed cuba in six hours before emerging into the atlantic ocean late on after which it began to cross the central bahamian archipelago at on the hurricane made a second landfall on long island bahamas with an intensity equivalent to that of a modern day continuing to track northeast the storm moved east of bermuda two days later 1 on the hurricane began to interact with an extratropical cyclone centered over the canadian maritimes 1 4 and later weakened to tropical storm strength 3 the tropical cyclone later became extratropical itself before it was last noted at on 3 preparations and impact edit caribbean sea jamaica and northern south america edit the british vessel s s phemius which followed the progress of the hurricane from and documented the lowest measured pressure as the hurricane moved slowly through the eastern and southern caribbean the rough seas and strong winds disrupted shipping routes on the american schooner abundance encountered the storm east of jamaica resulting in a destroyed rudder and a beaching on morant point 5 6 however the six crew were extracted from the disabled vessel and were transported to the united states 5 although the s s phemius would later return safely to port in cuba 1 reports that the ship had lost its smokestack and the relaying of an sos message prompted the united fruit company liner tela to search for the initially missing ship which failed due to poor visibility conditions 5 7 this was followed by a search operation undertaken by the uss overton dd 239 and uss swan am 34 8 on the s s phemius was found damaged and later towed to shore by a salvage tug however during the same period of time both the steamer tacira and the freighter san simeon were disabled after encountering the storm requiring towing to safety 9 several other ships in the immediate area were also hampered by the storm 10 some damage was reported in northern south america as the hurricane swept near the coast in colombia rail telecommunications were interrupted near santa marta and banana plantations in the area were believed to have suffered to some extent due to the winds and rain 5 in santa marta itself several homes were inundated and automotive traffic was hampered by the effects docks on santa port were also damaged 11 heavy rains also washed out some railways and bridges further disrupting the distribution of banana shipments 12 13 elsewhere along the coast many of seaports were damaged by the effects while inland farms suffered extensive flood damage 14 due to sparse reports from the remainder of colombia 15 the extent of damage in barranquilla remains unspecified 5 with other nearby towns reporting heavy damage 15 the village of sevilla valle del cauca was almost entirely destroyed 16 providencia island just off of colombia sustained significant agricultural damage and the loss of 4 to the northeast in curacao the passing hurricane destroyed the island fortifications 14 a seawall near the entrance to sint anna harbor suffered partial collapse while a pontoon bridge linking both sides of the harbor was completely destroyed in nearby bonaire a pier succumbed to the driving rain and rough seas 17 with the hurricane threatening jamaica pan american world airways cancelled its flights servicing kingston jamaica 18 in jamaica the passage to the west caused intense winds as strong as to sweep across the island 19 destroying over trees 20 although effects overall were generally minimal some localized areas on the island experienced as much as a of banana trees due to the storm 4 the cost of damage on jamaica was us 21 cayman islands edit the storm devastated the cayman islands especially cayman brac which was inundated by the storm surge which was reported to be as high as many homes and buildings were washed out to sea as a result of the storm and many people had to climb trees to escape the floodwaters died on the islands one of them was on grand cayman and the rest were on cayman brac 22 the ship balboa also sank as a result of the storm 23 cuba edit santa cruz del sur province cuba after the hurricane although no warnings were issued initially the national observatory of cuba voiced concerns that the intense tropical cyclone presented a danger to cuba particularly province as early as however the observatory indicated that forecasting the future motion of the hurricane was difficult as the intensity and previous motion was not consistent with climatology 24 on a hurricane warning was issued for the southeastern extent of cuba 25 as a precautionary measure shipping routes servicing ports in eastern cuba were suspended 26 the town of santa cruz del sur in province was virtually obliterated by a massive storm surge which measured in height 27 few buildings remained standing in the area in that coastal town alone a total of lost their lives in total died in cuba and damage there was estimated at 1932 usd $702.1 million today 27 see also edit tropical cyclones portal list of
