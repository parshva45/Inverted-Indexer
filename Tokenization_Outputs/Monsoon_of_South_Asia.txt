however the monsoon varies over the indian subcontinent within a range rains that exceed 10% typically lead to major floods while a 10% shortfall is a significant drought 2 the monsoon of south asia is among several geographically distributed global monsoons it affects the indian subcontinent where it is one of the oldest and most anticipated weather phenomena and an economically important pattern every year from june through september but it is only partly understood and notoriously difficult to predict several theories have been proposed to explain the origin process strength variability distribution and general vagaries of the monsoon but understanding and predictability are still evolving the unique geographical features of the indian subcontinent along with associated atmospheric oceanic and geophysical factors influence the behavior of the monsoon because of its effect on agriculture on flora and fauna and on the climates of nations such as india nepal bangladesh bhutan pakistan and sri lanka among other economic social and environmental effects the monsoon is one of the most anticipated tracked 3 and studied weather phenomena in the region it has a

season although generally defined as a system of winds characterized by a seasonal reversal of direction 6 lacks a consistent detailed definition some examples are the american meteorological society calls it a name for seasonal winds first applied to the winds blowing over the arabian sea from the northeast for six months and from the southwest for six months 6 the term has since been extended to similar winds in other parts of the world the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc describes a monsoon as a tropical and subtropical seasonal reversal in both surface winds and associated precipitation caused by differential heating between a continental scale land mass and the adjacent ocean 7 the indian meteorological department defines it as the seasonal reversal of the direction of winds along the shores of the indian ocean especially in the arabian sea which blow from the southwest for half of the year and from the northeast for the other half 8 colin stokes ramage in monsoon meteorology defines the monsoon as a seasonal reversing wind accompanied by corresponding changes in precipitation 9 background edit observed initially by sailors in the arabian sea 10 traveling between africa india and southeast asia the monsoon can be categorized into two branches based on their spread over the subcontinent arabian sea branch bay of bengal branch southwest monsoon clouds over tamil nadu alternatively it can be categorized into two segments based on the direction of rain bearing winds southwest sw monsoon northeast ne monsoon note 1 based on the time of year that these winds bring rain to india the monsoon can also be categorized into two periods summer monsoon may to september winter monsoon october to november the complexity of the monsoon of south asia is not completely understood making it difficult to accurately predict the quantity timing and geographic distribution of the accompanying precipitation these are the most monitored components of the monsoon and they determine the water availability in india for any given year 11 mechanism of the monsoon edit main article monsoon asian monsoon monsoon over india monsoons typically occur in tropical areas 12 one area that monsoons impact greatly is india 12 in india monsoons create an entire season in which the winds reverse completely 12 various atmospheric conditions influence the monsoon winds the first condition is the differential heating and cooling of land and water this creates low pressure on the landmass while high pressure is created over the seas around during daytime but is reversed during the nighttime the second condition is the shift in the position of inter tropical convergence zone itcz in summer the equatorial trough normally positioned about of the equator moves over the ganga plain creating a monsoon trough during the monsoon season the third condition is the presence of the high pressure area that develops east of madagascar it is approximately at over the indian ocean the intensity and position of this high pressure area affects the indian monsoon the fourth condition develops during the summer the tibetan plateau gets intensely heated resulting in strong vertical air currents and high pressure over the plateau about above sea level the fifth condition develops during the summer due to the movement of the westerly jet streams to the north of the himalayas and the presence of the tropical easterly jet stream over the indian peninsula changes in pressure over the southern oceans also affect the monsoons in certain years there is a reversal in the pressure conditions this periodic change in pressure conditions is known as the southern oscillation or so the southern oscillation is connected to el nino which is a warm ocean current that flows past the peruvian coast it flows every two to five years in place of the cold peruvian current the phenomenon is referred to as enso el nino southern oscillations in india the monsoon lasts for 100 to 120 days from early june and to mid september the monsoon winds encounter various atmospheric conditions on their way and hence are pulsating in nature and not steady the monsoon arrives with a sudden downpour of rainfall that continues for several days this is known as the of the monsoon the rainfall is a result of the convergence of wind flow from the bay of bengal and reverse winds from the south china sea 13 the onset of the monsoon occurs over the bay of bengal in may 13 arriving at the indian peninsula by june 12 and then the winds move towards the south china sea 13 by early september the monsoon starts to withdraw or retreat and is a more gradual process by mid october it withdraws completely from the northern half of the peninsula the withdrawal takes place progressively from north to south from the first week of december to the first week of january this is the start of the winter season the retreating monsoon winds move over the arabian sea and the bay of bengal and collect moisture on the way these monsoon winds reach the southern states of india by october and are responsible for a second round of rainfall these are called the winter monsoons the winter monsoon is experienced in the states of karnataka tamil nadu kerala and andhra pradesh in the first week of january effect of geographical relief features edit although the southwest and northeast monsoon winds are seasonally reversible they do not cause precipitation on their own main article rain two factors are essential for rain formation moisture laden winds droplet formation additionally one of the causes of rain must happen in the case of the monsoon the cause is primarily orographic due to the presence of highlands in the path of the winds orographic barriers force wind to rise precipitation then occurs on the windward side of the highlands because of adiabatic cooling and condensation of the moist rising air main article orographic lift the unique geographic relief features of the indian subcontinent come into play in allowing all of the above factors to occur simultaneously the relevant features in explaining the monsoon mechanism are as follows the presence of abundant water bodies around the subcontinent the arabian sea bay of bengal and indian ocean these help moisture accumulate in the winds during the hot season the presence of abundant highlands like the western ghats and the himalayas right across the path of the southwest monsoon winds these are the main cause of the substantial orographic precipitation throughout the subcontinent note 2 the western ghats are the first highlands of india that the southwest monsoon winds encounter note 3 the western ghats rise abruptly from the western coastal plains of the subcontinent making effective orographic barriers for the monsoon winds the himalayas play more than the role of orographic barriers for the monsoon they also help confine it to the subcontinent without them the southwest monsoon winds would blow right over the indian subcontinent into tibet afghanistan and russia without causing any rain note 4 for the northeast monsoon the highlands of the eastern ghats play the role of orographic barrier pink arrow southwest monsoon wind direction green arrow northeast monsoon wind direction orographic precipitation geographical features of the indian subcontinent daytime scene showing the pre monsoon air over india recent trends in average annual precipitation from monsoons features of monsoon rains edit there are some unique features of the rains that the monsoon brings to the indian subcontinent bursting edit monsoon burst over mumbai bursting of monsoon refers to the sudden change in weather conditions in india typically from hot and dry weather to wet and humid weather during the southwest monsoon characterized by an abrupt rise in the mean daily rainfall 14 15 similarly the burst of the northeast monsoon refers to an abrupt increase in the mean daily rainfall over the affected regions 16 rain variability vagaries edit one of the most commonly used words to describe the erratic nature of the monsoon is vagaries used in newspapers 17 magazines 18 books 19 web portals 20 to insurance plans 21 and budget discussions 22 in some years it rains too much causing floods in parts of india in others it rains too little or not at all causing droughts in some years the rain quantity is sufficient but its timing arbitrary sometimes despite average annual rainfall the daily distribution or geographic distribution of the rain is substantially skewed in the recent past rainfall variability in short time periods about a week were attributed to desert dust over the arabian sea and western asia 23 ideal and normal monsoon rains edit annual average rainfall in india normally the southwest monsoon can be expected to burst onto the western coast of india near thiruvananthapuram at the beginning of june and to cover the entire country by mid july 11 24 25 its withdrawal from india typically starts at the beginning of september and finishes by the beginning of october 26 27 the northeast monsoon usually bursts around the 20th of october and lasts for about 50 days before withdrawing 16 however a rainy monsoon is not necessarily a normal monsoon that is one that performs close to statistical averages calculated over a long period a normal monsoon is generally accepted to be one involving close to the average quantity of precipitation over all the geographical locations under its influence mean spatial distribution and over the entire expected time period mean temporal distribution additionally the arrival date and the departure date of both the southwest and northeast monsoon should be close to the mean dates the exact criteria for a normal monsoon are defined by the indian meteorological department with calculations for the mean and standard deviation of each of these variables 28 a monsoon with excess rain can cause floods and one with too little rain can lead to widespread drought famine and economic losses therefore a normal monsoon with mean performance is the most desirable monsoon theories for mechanism of monsoon edit theories of the mechanism of the monsoon primarily try to explain the reasons for the seasonal reversal of winds and the timing of their reversal traditional theory edit main article sea breeze because of differences in the specific heat capacity of land and water continents heat up faster than seas consequently the air above coastal lands heats up faster than the air above seas this creates areas of low air pressure above coastal lands compared with pressure over the seas causing winds to flow from the seas onto the neighboring lands this is known as sea breeze process of monsoon creation edit main article monsoon a sea breeze b land breeze also known as the thermal theory or the differential heating of sea and land theory the traditional theory portrays the monsoon as a large scale sea breeze it states that during the hot subtropical summers the massive landmass of the indian peninsula heats up at a different rate than the surrounding seas resulting in a pressure gradient from south to north this causes the flow of moisture laden winds from sea to land on reaching land these winds rise because of the geographical relief cooling adiabatically and leading to orographic rains this is the southwest monsoon the reverse happens during the winter when the land is colder than the sea establishing a pressure gradient from land to sea this causes the winds to blow over the indian subcontinent toward the indian ocean in a northeasterly direction causing the northeast monsoon because the southwest monsoon flows from sea to land it carries more moisture and therefore causes more rain than the northeast monsoon only part of the northeast monsoon passing over the bay of bengal picks up moisture causing rain in andhra pradesh and tamil nadu during the winter months however many meteorologists argue that the monsoon is not a local phenomenon as explained by the traditional theory but a general weather phenomenon along the entire tropical zone of earth this criticism does not deny the role of differential heating of sea and land in generating monsoon winds but casts it as one of several factors rather than the only one dynamic theory edit the atmospheric circulation system with associated pressure belts and latitudes main article prevailing winds main article atmospheric circulation the prevailing winds of the atmospheric circulation arise because of the difference in pressure at various latitudes and act as means for distribution of thermal energy on the planet this pressure difference is because of the differences in solar insolation received at different latitudes and the resulting uneven heating of the planet alternating belts of high pressure and low pressure develop along the equator the two tropics the arctic and antarctic circles and the two polar regions giving rise to the trade winds the westerlies and the polar easterlies however geophysical factors like orbit its rotation and its axial tilt cause these belts to shift gradually north and south following the sun s seasonal shifts process of monsoon creation edit the dynamic theory explains the monsoon on the basis of the annual shifts in the position of global belts of pressure and winds according to this theory the monsoon is a result of the shift of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz under the influence of the vertical sun though the mean position of the itcz is taken as the equator it shifts north and south with the migration of the vertical sun toward the tropics of cancer and capricorn during the summer of the respective hemispheres northern and southern hemisphere as such during the northern summer may and june the itcz moves north along with the vertical sun toward the tropic of cancer the itcz as the zone of lowest pressure in the tropical region is the target destination for the trade winds of both hemispheres consequently with the itcz at the tropic of cancer the southeast trade winds of the southern hemisphere have to cross the equator to reach it note 5 however because of the coriolis effect which causes winds in the northern hemisphere to turn right whereas winds in the southern hemisphere turn left these southeast trade winds are deflected east in the northern hemisphere transforming into southwest trades note 6 these pick up moisture while traveling from sea to land and cause orographic rain once they hit the highlands of the indian peninsula this results in the southwest monsoon the dynamic theory explains the monsoon as a global weather phenomenon rather than just a local one and when coupled with the traditional theory based on the heating of sea and land it enhances the explanation of the varying intensity of monsoon precipitation along the coastal regions with orographic barriers jet stream theory edit main article jet stream jet streams of earth this theory tries to explain the establishment of the northeast and southwest monsoons as well as unique features like bursting and variability the jet streams are systems of upper air westerlies they give rise to slowly moving upper air waves with 250 knot winds in some air streams first observed by world war ii pilots they develop just below the tropopause over areas of steep pressure gradient on the surface the main types are the polar jets the subtropical westerly jets and the less common tropical easterly jets they follow the principle of geostrophic winds note 7 process of monsoon creation edit the tibetan plateau lies north of the himalayas over india a subtropical westerly jet develops in the winter season and is replaced by the tropical easterly jet in the summer season the high temperature during the summer over the tibetan plateau as well as over central asia in general is believed to be the critical factor leading to the formation of the tropical easterly jet over india the mechanism affecting the monsoon is that the westerly jet causes high pressure over northern parts of the subcontinent during the winter this results in the north to south flow of the winds in the form of the northeast monsoon with the northward shift of the vertical sun this jet shifts north too the intense heat over the tibetan plateau coupled with associated terrain features like the high altitude of the plateau generate the tropical easterly jet over central india this jet creates a low pressure zone over the northern indian plains influencing the wind flow toward these plains and assisting the development of the southwest monsoon theories for bursting edit the bursting 14 of the monsoon is primarily explained by the jet stream theory and the dynamic theory dynamic theory edit according to this theory during the summer months in the northern hemisphere the itcz shifts north pulling the southwest monsoon winds onto the land from the sea however the huge landmass of the himalayas restricts the low pressure zone onto the himalayas themselves it is only when the tibetan plateau heats up significantly more than the himalayas that the itcz abruptly and swiftly shifts north leading to the bursting of monsoon rains over the indian subcontinent the reverse shift takes place for the northeast monsoon winds leading to a second minor burst of rainfall over the eastern indian peninsula during the northern hemisphere winter months jet stream theory edit according to this theory the onset of the southwest monsoon is driven by the shift of the subtropical westerly jet north from over the plains of india toward the tibetan plateau this shift is due to the intense heating of the plateau during the summer months the northward shift is not a slow and gradual process as expected for most changes in weather pattern the primary cause is believed to be the height of the himalayas as the tibetan plateau heats up the low pressure created over it pulls the westerly jet north because of the lofty himalayas the westerly movement is inhibited but with continuous dropping pressure sufficient force is created for the movement of the westerly jet across the himalayas after a significant period as such the shift of the jet is sudden and abrupt causing the bursting of southwest monsoon rains onto the indian plains the reverse shift happens for the northeast monsoon theories for monsoon variability edit the jet stream effect edit the jet stream theory also explains the variability in timing and strength of the monsoon timing a timely northward shift of the subtropical westerly jet at the beginning of summer is critical to the onset of the southwest monsoon over india if the shift is delayed so is the southwest monsoon an early shift results in an early monsoon strength the strength of the southwest monsoon is determined by the strength of the easterly tropical jet over central india a strong easterly tropical jet results in a strong southwest monsoon over central india and a weak jet results in a weak monsoon el oscillation effect edit main article el oscillation effects of el on the weather of the subcontinent el is a warm ocean current originating along the coast of peru that replaces the usual cold humboldt current the warm surface water moving toward the coast of peru with el is pushed west by the trade winds thereby raising the temperature of the southern pacific ocean the reverse condition is known as la southern oscillation a phenomenon first observed by sir gilbert thomas walker director general of observatories in india refers to the seesaw relationship of atmospheric pressures between tahiti and darwin australia 29 walker noticed that when pressure was high in tahiti it was low in darwin and vice versa 29 a southern oscillation index soi based on the pressure difference between tahiti and darwin has been formulated by the bureau of meteorology australia to measure the strength of the oscillation 30 walker noticed that the quantity of rainfall in the indian subcontinent was often negligible in years of high pressure over darwin and low pressure over tahiti conversely low pressure over darwin bodes well for precipitation quantity in india thus walker established the relationship between southern oscillation and quantities of monsoon rains in india 29 ultimately the southern oscillation was found to be simply an atmospheric component of the el effect which happens in the ocean 29 therefore in the context of the monsoon the two together came to be known as the el oscillation enso effect the effect is known to have a pronounced influence on the strength of the southwest monsoon over india with the monsoon being weak causing droughts during el years while la years bring particularly strong monsoons 29 indian ocean dipole effect edit main article indian ocean dipole although the enso effect was statistically effective in explaining several past droughts in india in recent decades its relationship with the indian monsoon seemed to weaken 31 for example the strong enso of 1997 did not cause drought in india 29 however it was later discovered that just like enso in the pacific ocean a similar seesaw ocean atmosphere system in the indian ocean was also in play this system was discovered in 1999 and named the indian ocean dipole iod an index to calculate it was also formulated iod develops in the equatorial region of the indian ocean from april to may and peaks in october 29 with a positive iod winds over the indian ocean blow from east to west this makes the arabian sea the western indian ocean near the african coast much warmer and the eastern indian ocean around indonesia colder and drier 29 in negative dipole years the reverse happens making indonesia much warmer and rainier a positive iod index often negates the effect of enso resulting in increased monsoon rains in years such as 1983 1994 and 1997 29 further the two poles of the iod the eastern pole around indonesia and the western pole off the african coast independently and cumulatively affect the quantity of monsoon rains 29 equatorial indian ocean oscillation edit as with enso the atmospheric component of the iod was later discovered and the cumulative phenomenon named equatorial indian ocean oscillation equinoo 29 when equinoo effects are factored in certain failed forecasts like the acute drought of 2002 can be further accounted for 29 the relationship between extremes of the indian summer monsoon rainfall along with enso and equinoo 32 have been studied and models to better predict the quantity of monsoon rains have been statistically derived 32 impact of climate change on the monsoon edit since 1950s the south asian summer monsoon underwent a gradual decline with a reduction of up to 10% over central india 33 this is primarily due to a weakening monsoon circulation as a result of the rapid warming in the indian ocean 34 35 and changes in land use and land cover 36 since the strength of the monsoon is partially dependent on the temperature difference between the ocean and the land higher ocean temperatures in the indian ocean have weakened the moisture bearing winds from the ocean to the land the reduction in the summer monsoon rainfall have grave consequences over central india because at least 60% of the agriculture in this region is still largely rain fed a recent assessment of the monsoonal changes indicate that the land warming has increased during 2002-2014 possibly reviving the strength of the monsoon circulation and rainfall 37 future changes in the monsoon will depend on a competition between land and which is warming faster than the other meanwhile there has been a three fold rise in widespread extreme rainfall events during the years 1950 to 2015 over the entire central belt of india leading to a steady rise in the number of flash floods with significant socioeconomic losses 38 39 widespread extreme rainfall events are those rainfall events which are larger than 150 mm day and spread over a region large enough to cause floods monsoon rain prediction models edit since the great famine of in india various attempts have been made to predict monsoon rainfall 40 at least five prediction models exist 41 seasonal prediction of indian monsoon spim edit the centre for development of advanced computing cdac at bengaluru facilitated the seasonal prediction of indian monsoon spim experiment on the param padma supercomputing system 42 this project involved simulated runs of historical data from 1985 to 2004 to try to establish the relationship of five atmospheric general circulation models with monsoon rainfall distribution 41 indian meteorological department model edit the department has tried to forecast the monsoon for india since 1884 40 and is the only official agency entrusted with making public forecasts about the quantity distribution and timing of the monsoon rains its position as the sole authority on the monsoon was cemented in 2005 41 by the department of science and technology dst new delhi in 2003 imd substantially changed its forecast methodology model 43 and administration 44 a sixteen parameter monsoon forecasting model used since 1988 was replaced in 2003 43 however following the 2009 drought in india worst since 1972 45 the department decided in 2010 that it needed to develop an indigenous model 46 to further improve its prediction capabilities significance edit western ghats maharashtra on 28 may in dry season western ghats maharashtra on 28 august in rainy season the monsoon is the primary delivery mechanism for fresh water in the indian subcontinent as such it affects the environment and associated flora fauna and ecosystems agriculture society hydro power production and geography of the subcontinent like the availability of fresh water in water bodies and the underground water table with all of these factors cumulatively contributing to the health of the economy of affected countries the monsoon turns large parts of india from semi deserts into green grasslands see photos taken only three months apart in the western ghats geographical wettest spots on earth edit mawsynram and cherrapunji both in the indian state of meghalaya alternate as the wettest places on earth given the quantity of their rainfall 47 though there are other cities with similar claims they receive more than 11,000 millimeters of rain each from the monsoon agricultural edit in india which has historically had a primarily agrarian economy the services sector recently overtook the farm sector in terms of gdp contribution however the agriculture sector still contributes 17-20% of gdp 48 and is the largest employer in the country with about 60% of indians dependent on it for employment and livelihood 48 about 49% of land is agricultural that number rises to 55% if associated wetlands dryland farming areas etc are included because more than half of these farmlands are rain fed the monsoon is critical to food sufficiency and quality of life despite progress in alternative forms of irrigation agricultural dependence on the monsoon remains far from insignificant therefore the agricultural calendar of india is governed by the monsoon any fluctuations in the time distribution spatial distribution or quantity of the monsoon rains may lead to floods or droughts causing the agricultural sector to suffer this has a cascading effect on the secondary economic sectors the overall economy food inflation and therefore the general quality and cost of living economic edit the economic significance of the monsoon is aptly described by pranab mukherjee s remark that the monsoon is the real finance minister of india 4 5 a good monsoon results in better agricultural yields which brings down prices of essential food commodities and reduces imports thus reducing food inflation overall 48 better rains also result in increased hydroelectric production 48 all of these factors have positive ripple effects throughout the economy of india 48 the down side however is that when monsoon rains are weak crop production is low leading to higher food prices with limited supply 49 as a result the indian government is actively working with farmers and the meteorological department to produce more drought resistant crops 49 social edit d subbarao governor of the reserve bank of india emphasized during a quarterly review of monetary policy that the lives of indians depend on the performance of the monsoon 50 his own career prospects his emotional well being and the performance of his monetary policy are all a hostage to the monsoon he said as is the case for most indians 50 additionally farmers rendered jobless by failed monsoon rains tend to migrate to cities this crowds city slums and aggravates the infrastructure and sustainability of city life 51 travel edit in the past indians usually refrained from traveling during monsoons for practical as well as religious reasons but with the advent of globalization such travel is gaining popularity places like kerala and the western ghats get a large number of tourists both local and foreigners during the monsoon season kerala is one of the top destinations for tourists interested in ayurvedic treatments and massage therapy one major drawback of traveling during the monsoon is that most wildlife sanctuaries are closed also some mountainous areas especially in himalayan regions get cut off when roads are damaged by landslides and floods during heavy rains 52 environmental edit the monsoon is the primary bearer of fresh water to the area the peninsular deccan rivers of india are mostly rain fed and non perennial in nature depending primarily on the monsoon for water supply 53 most of the coastal rivers of western india are also rain fed and monsoon dependent 53 54 as such the flora fauna and entire ecosystems of these areas rely heavily on the monsoon citation needed see also edit weather portal india portal east asian monsoon climate of india section monsoon asian brown

wind is based on the direction that it blows from southwest winds blow onto the land from the southwest northeast winds flow from the northeast toward the southwest onto the land the aravalli mountains also lie in the path of the southwest monsoon but do not result in much precipitation because they are in the direction of the path of the southwest winds and not across them causing no orographic lift of the winds other major highlands like the cardamom hills anaimalai hills and nilgiri mountains that play active roles in the monsoon are considered major extensions of the western ghats and are thus not discussed separately first the himalayas serve as orographic barriers to the southwest monsoon winds second they help confine the winds to the subcontinent hampering their northward progress third they contribute to the convergence of the bay of bengal branch and arabian sea branch of the southwest monsoon winds increasing the intensity of precipitation over the northern part of the subcontinent fourth they are a major factor in the bursting of the monsoon under the jet stream theory fifth they help determine the direction of the bay of bengal branch of the northeast monsoon their role is still a matter of active study and understanding of them is evolving regularly when the southeast trade winds cross the equator they are perceived in the northern hemisphere as equatorial westerlies because they seem to blow from the equator toward the tropic of cancer similarly when the itcz is at the tropic of cancer the northeast trade winds are confined to the area north of the tropic of cancer change of direction or origin of winds alters their nomenclature as noted above geostrophic winds blow parallel to the isobars and keep low pressure zones to their left in the northern hemisphere and to their right in the southern hemisphere the reversal is a result of the coriolis effect references edit india meteorological department monsoon data
