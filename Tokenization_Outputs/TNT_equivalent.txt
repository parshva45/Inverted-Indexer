this template message diagram of explosive yield vs mushroom cloud height illustrating the difference between 22 kiloton fat man and 15 megaton castle bravo explosions citation needed tnt equivalent is a convention for expressing energy typically used to describe the energy released in an explosion the ton of tnt is a unit of energy defined by that convention to be 4.184 gigajoules 1 which is the approximate energy released in the detonation of a metric ton 1,000 kilograms or one megagram of tnt the convention intends to compare the destructiveness of an event with that of conventional explosive materials of which tnt is a typical example although other conventional explosives such as dynamite contain more energy contents 1 kiloton and megaton 2 historical derivation of the value 3 conversion to other units 4 examples 5 relative effectiveness factor 5.1 re factor examples 5.2 nuclear examples 6 see also 7 references kiloton and megaton edit the kiloton of tnt is a unit of energy equal to 4.184 tera joules the megaton of tnt is a unit of energy equal to 4.184 peta joules the kiloton and megaton of tnt have traditionally been used to describe the energy output and hence the destructive power of a nuclear weapon the tnt equivalent appears in various nuclear weapon control treaties and has been used to characterize the energy released in such other highly destructive events as an asteroid impact 2 historical derivation of the value edit a gram of tnt releases joules upon explosion 3 the energy liberated by one gram of tnt was arbitrarily defined as a matter of convention to be 4 which is exactly one kilocalorie an energy is normally expressed as the thermodynamic work produced by its detonation which for tnt has been accurately measured as from a large sample of air blast experiments and theoretically calculated to be 5 the measured pure heat output of a gram of tnt is only 6 clarification needed but this is not the important value for explosive blast effect calculations alternative tnt equivalency can be calculated as a function of when in the detonation the value is measured and which property is being compared 7 8 9 10 a kiloton of tnt can

greater the re the more powerful the explosive this enables engineers to determine the proper masses of different explosives when applying blasting formulas developed specifically for tnt for example if a timber cutting formula calls for a charge of of tnt then based on octanitrocubane s re factor of 2.38 it would take only 1.0/2.38 or 0.42 kg of it to do the same job using petn engineers would need 1.0/1.66 or 0.60 kg to obtain the same effects as of tnt with anfo or ammonium nitrate they would require 1.0/0.74 or 1.35 kg or 1.0/0.42 or 2.38 kg respectively re factor examples edit some re
