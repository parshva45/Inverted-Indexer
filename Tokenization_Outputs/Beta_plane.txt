beta plane wikipedia beta plane from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search in geophysical fluid dynamics an approximation whereby the coriolis parameter f is set to vary linearly in space is called a beta plane approximation on a rotating sphere such as the earth f varies with the sine of latitude in the so called f plane approximation this variation is ignored and a value of f appropriate for a particular latitude is used throughout the domain this approximation can be visualized as a tangent plane touching the surface of the sphere at this latitude a more accurate model is a linear approximation to this variability about a given latitude in the sense of a taylor series expansion in analogy with the f plane this approximation is termed the beta plane even though it no longer describes dynamics on a hypothetical tangent plane the advantage of the beta plane approximation over more accurate formulations is that it does not contribute nonlinear terms to the dynamical equations such terms make the equations harder to solve the name beta plane derives from the convention to denote the linear coefficient of variation with the greek letter the beta plane approximation is useful for the theoretical analysis of many phenomena in geophysical fluid dynamics since it makes the equations much more tractable yet retains the important information that the coriolis parameter varies in space in particular rossby waves the most important type of waves if one considers large scale atmospheric and oceanic dynamics depend on the variation of f as a restoring force they do not occur if the coriolis parameter is approximated only as a constant see also edit rossby parameter coriolis effect coriolis frequency baroclinic instability references edit holton j r an introduction to dynamical meteorology academic press 2004 isbn 978-0-12-354015-7 pedlosky j geophysical fluid dynamics springer verlag 1992 isbn 978-0-387-96387-7 retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title beta plane oldid 788969508 categories fluid dynamics atmospheric dynamics oceanography navigation menu personal tools not logged in talk contributions create account log in namespaces article talk variants views read edit view history more search navigation main page contents featured content current events random article donate to wikipedia wikipedia store interaction help about wikipedia community portal recent changes contact page tools what links here related changes upload file special pages permanent link page information wikidata item cite this page print export create a book download as pdf printable version languages norsk norsk nynorsk polski edit links this page was last edited on 4 july 2017 at 15 08 text is available under the creative commons attribution sharealike license additional terms may apply by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non profit organization privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
