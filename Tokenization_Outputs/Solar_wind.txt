solar wind wikipedia solar wind from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search this article is about the stellar wind from the sun for other uses see solar wind disambiguation ulysses observations of solar wind speed as a function of helio latitude during solar minimum slow wind 400 km s is confined to the equatorial regions while fast wind 750 km s is seen over the poles 1 red blue colours show inward outward polarities of the heliospheric magnetic field the solar wind is a stream of charged particles released from the upper atmosphere of the sun called the corona this plasma consists of mostly electrons protons and alpha particles with thermal energies between 1.5 and 10 kev embedded within the solar wind plasma is the interplanetary magnetic field 2 the solar wind varies in density temperature and speed over time and over solar latitude and longitude its particles can escape the gravity because of their high energy resulting from the high temperature of the corona which in turn is a result of the coronal magnetic field at a distance of more than a few solar radii from the sun the solar wind is supersonic and reaches speeds of 250 to 750 kilometers per second 3 the flow of the solar wind is no longer supersonic at the termination shock the voyager 2 spacecraft crossed the shock more than five times between 30 august and 10 december 2007 4 voyager 2 crossed the shock about a billion kilometers closer to the sun than the 13.5 billion kilometer distance where voyager 1 came upon the termination shock 5 6 the spacecraft moved outward through the termination shock into the heliosheath and onward toward the interstellar medium other related phenomena include the aurora northern and southern lights the plasma tails of comets that always point away from the sun and geomagnetic storms that can change the direction of magnetic field lines contents 1 history 2 acceleration 3 properties and structure 3.1 fast and slow solar wind 3.2 pressure

history edit the existence of particles flowing outward from the sun to the earth was first suggested by british astronomer richard c carrington in 1859 carrington and richard hodgson independently made the first observation of what would later be called a solar flare this is a sudden localised increase in brightness on the solar disc which is now known 7 to often occur in conjunction with an episodic ejection of material and magnetic flux from the atmosphere known as a coronal mass ejection on the following day a geomagnetic storm was observed and carrington suspected that there might be a connection which is now attributed to the arrival of the coronal mass ejection in near earth space and its subsequent interaction with the magnetosphere george fitzgerald later suggested that matter was being regularly accelerated away from the sun and was reaching the earth after several days 8 laboratory simulation of the influence on the solar wind these auroral like birkeland currents were created in a terrella a magnetised anode globe in an evacuated chamber in 1910 british astrophysicist arthur eddington essentially suggested the existence of the solar wind without naming it in a footnote to an article on comet morehouse 9 the idea never fully caught on even though eddington had also made a similar suggestion at a royal institution address the previous year in the latter case he postulated that the ejected material consisted of electrons while in his study of comet morehouse he supposed them to be ions 9 the first person to suggest that the ejected material consisted of both ions and electrons was kristian birkeland his geomagnetic surveys showed that auroral activity was nearly uninterrupted as these displays and other geomagnetic activity were being produced by particles from the sun he concluded that the earth was being continually bombarded by rays of electric corpuscles emitted by the sun 8 in 1916 birkeland proposed that from a physical point of view it is most probable that solar rays are neither exclusively negative nor positive rays but of both kinds in other words the solar wind consists of both negative electrons and positive ions 10 three years later in 1919 frederick lindemann also suggested that particles of both polarities protons as well as electrons come from the sun 11 around the 1930s scientists had determined that the temperature of the solar corona must be a million degrees celsius because of the way it stood out into space as seen during total eclipses later spectroscopic work confirmed this extraordinary temperature in the mid 1950s sydney chapman calculated the properties of a gas at such a temperature and determined it was such a superb conductor of heat that it must extend way out into space beyond the orbit of earth also in the 1950s ludwig biermann became interested in the fact that no matter whether a comet is headed towards or away from the sun its tail always points away from the sun biermann postulated that this happens because the sun emits a steady stream of particles that pushes the tail away 12 wilfried claimed that paul ahnert was the first to relate solar wind to comet tail direction based on observations of the comet whipple fedke 1942g 13 eugene parker realised that the heat flowing from the sun in model and the comet tail blowing away from the sun in hypothesis had to be the result of the same phenomenon which he termed the solar wind 14 15 parker showed in 1958 that even though the corona is strongly attracted by solar gravity it is such a good heat conductor that it is still very hot at large distances since gravity weakens as distance from the sun increases the outer coronal atmosphere escapes supersonically into interstellar space furthermore parker was the first person to notice that the weakening effect of the gravity has the same effect on hydrodynamic flow as a de laval nozzle it incites a transition from subsonic to supersonic flow 16 opposition to hypothesis on the solar wind was strong the paper he submitted to the astrophysical journal in 1958 was rejected by two reviewers it was saved by the editor subrahmanyan chandrasekhar who later received the 1983 nobel prize in physics in january 1959 the soviet satellite luna 1 first directly observed the solar wind and measured its strength 17 18 19 they were detected by hemispherical ion traps the discovery made by konstantin gringauz was verified by luna 2 luna 3 and by the more distant measurements of venera 1 three years later its measurement was performed by neugebauer and collaborators using the mariner 2 spacecraft 20 in the late 1990s the ultraviolet coronal spectrometer uvcs instrument on board the soho spacecraft observed the acceleration region of the fast solar wind emanating from the poles of the sun and found that the wind accelerates much faster than can be accounted for by thermodynamic expansion alone model predicted that the wind should make the transition to supersonic flow at an altitude of about 4 solar radii from the photosphere surface but the transition or sonic point now appears to be much lower perhaps only 1 solar radius above the photosphere suggesting that some additional mechanism accelerates the solar wind away from the sun the acceleration of the fast wind is still not understood and cannot be fully explained by theory the gravitational and electromagnetic explanation for this acceleration is however detailed in an earlier paper by 1970 nobel laureate for physics hannes 21 22 the first numerical simulation of the solar wind in the solar corona including closed and open field lines was performed by pneuman and kopp in 1971 the magnetohydrodynamics equations in steady state were solved iteratively starting with an initial dipolar configuration 23 in 1990 the ulysses probe was launched to study the solar wind from high solar latitudes all prior observations had been made at or near the solar ecliptic plane 24 acceleration edit while early models of the solar wind relied primarily on thermal energy to accelerate the material by the 1960s it was clear that thermal acceleration alone cannot account for the high speed of solar wind an additional unknown acceleration mechanism is required and likely relates to magnetic fields in the solar atmosphere the corona or extended outer layer is a region of plasma that is heated to over a million kelvin as a result of thermal collisions the particles within the inner corona have a range and distribution of speeds described by a maxwellian distribution the mean velocity of these particles is about which is well below the solar escape velocity of however a few of the particles achieve energies sufficient to reach the terminal velocity of which allows them to feed the solar wind at the same temperature electrons due to their much smaller mass reach escape velocity and build up an electric field that further accelerates ions away from the sun 25 the total number of particles carried away from the sun by the solar wind is about 1.3 10 36 per second 26 thus the total mass loss each year is about 10 14 solar masses 27 or about one billion kilograms per second this is equivalent to losing a mass equal to the earth every years 28 however only about 0.01% of the total mass has been lost through the solar wind 29 other stars have much stronger stellar winds that result in significantly higher mass loss rates properties and structure edit fast and slow solar wind edit the solar wind is observed to exist in two fundamental states termed the slow solar wind and the fast solar wind though their differences extend well beyond their speeds in near earth space the slow solar wind is observed to have a velocity of a temperature of 10 6 k and a composition that is a close match to the corona by contrast the fast solar wind has a typical velocity of a temperature of 8 10 5 k and it nearly matches the composition of the photosphere 30 the slow solar wind is twice as dense and more variable in nature than the fast solar wind 26 31 the slow solar wind appears to originate from a region around the equatorial belt that is known as the streamer belt where coronal streamers are produced by magnetic flux open to the heliosphere draping over closed magnetic loops the exact coronal structures involved in slow solar wind formation and the method by which the material is released is still under debate 32 33 34 observations of the sun between 1996 and 2001 showed that emission of the slow solar wind occurred at latitudes up to during the solar minimum the period of lowest solar activity then expanded toward the poles as the solar cycle approached maximum at solar maximum the poles were also emitting a slow solar wind 1 the fast solar wind originates from coronal holes 35 which are funnel like regions of open field lines in the magnetic field 36 such open lines are particularly prevalent around the magnetic poles the plasma source is small magnetic fields created by convection cells in the solar atmosphere these fields confine the plasma and transport it into the narrow necks of the coronal funnels which are located only above the photosphere the plasma is released into the funnel when these magnetic field lines reconnect 37 pressure edit the wind exerts a pressure at 1 au typically in the range of 10 9 n m 2 although it can readily vary outside that range the ram pressure is a function of wind speed and density the formula is p m p n v 2 1.6726 10 6 n v 2 where m p is the proton mass pressure p is in npa nanopascals n is the density in particles cm 3 and v is the speed in km s of the solar wind citation needed coronal mass ejection edit main article coronal mass ejection both the fast and slow solar wind can be interrupted by large fast moving bursts of plasma called interplanetary coronal mass ejections or icmes icmes are the interplanetary manifestation of solar coronal mass ejections which are caused by release of magnetic energy at the sun cmes are often called solar storms or space storms in the popular media they are sometimes but not always associated with solar flares which are another manifestation of magnetic energy release at the sun icmes cause shock waves in the thin plasma of the heliosphere launching electromagnetic waves and accelerating particles mostly protons and electrons to form showers of ionizing radiation that precede the cme when a cme impacts the magnetosphere it temporarily deforms the magnetic field changing the direction of compass needles and inducing large electrical ground currents in earth itself this is called a geomagnetic storm and it is a global phenomenon cme impacts can induce magnetic reconnection in magnetotail the midnight side of the magnetosphere this launches protons and electrons downward toward atmosphere where they form the aurora icmes are not the only cause of space weather different patches on the sun are known to give rise to slightly different speeds and densities of wind depending on local conditions in isolation each of these different wind streams would form a spiral with a slightly different angle with fast moving streams moving out more directly and slow moving streams wrapping more around the sun fast moving streams tend to overtake slower streams that originate westward of them on the sun forming turbulent co rotating interaction regions that give rise to wave motions and accelerated particles and that affect magnetosphere in the same way as but more gently than cmes solar system effects edit main article space weather the heliospheric current sheet results from the influence of the rotating magnetic field on the plasma in the solar wind over the lifetime the interaction of its surface layers with the escaping solar wind has significantly decreased its surface rotation rate 38 the wind is considered responsible for comets tails along with the radiation 39 the solar wind contributes to fluctuations in celestial radio waves observed on the earth through an effect called interplanetary scintillation 40 magnetospheres edit main article magnetosphere schematic of magnetosphere the solar wind flows from left to right where the solar wind intersects with a planet that has a well developed magnetic field such as earth jupiter and saturn the particles are deflected by the lorentz force this region known as the magnetosphere causes the particles to travel around the planet rather than bombarding the atmosphere or surface the magnetosphere is roughly shaped like a hemisphere on the side facing the sun then is drawn out in a long wake on the opposite side the boundary of this region is called the magnetopause and some of the particles are able to penetrate the magnetosphere through this region by partial reconnection of the magnetic field lines 25 noon meridian section of magnetosphere the solar wind is responsible for the overall shape of magnetosphere fluctuations in its speed density direction and entrained magnetic field strongly affect local space environment for example the levels of ionizing radiation and radio interference can vary by factors of hundreds to thousands and the shape and location of the magnetopause and bow shock wave upstream of it can change by several earth radii exposing geosynchronous satellites to the direct solar wind these phenomena are collectively called space weather from the european space agency cluster mission a new study has taken place that proposes that it is easier for the solar wind to infiltrate the magnetosphere than previously believed a group of scientists directly observed the existence of certain waves in the solar wind that were not expected a recent study shows that these waves enable incoming charged particles of solar wind to breach the magnetopause this suggests that the magnetic bubble forms more as a filter than a continuous barrier this latest discovery occurred through the distinctive arrangement of the four identical cluster spacecraft which fly in a controlled configuration through near earth space as they sweep from the magnetosphere into interplanetary space and back again the fleet provides exceptional three dimensional insights on the phenomena that connect the sun to earth the research characterized variances in formation of the interplanetary magnetic field imf largely influenced by kelvin helmholtz waves which occur at the interface of two fluids as a result of differences in thickness and numerous other characteristics of the boundary layer experts believe that this was the first occasion that the appearance of kelvin helmholtz waves at the magnetopause had been displayed at high latitude dawnward orientation of the imf these waves are being seen in unforeseen places under solar wind conditions that were formerly believed to be undesired for their generation these discoveries show how magnetosphere can be penetrated by solar particles under specific imf circumstances the findings are also relevant to studies of magnetospheric progressions around other planetary bodies this study suggests that kelvin helmholtz waves can be a somewhat common and possibly constant instrument for the entrance of solar wind into terrestrial magnetospheres under various imf orientations 41 atmospheres edit the solar wind affects other incoming cosmic rays interacting with planetary atmospheres moreover planets with a weak or non existent magnetosphere are subject to atmospheric stripping by the solar wind venus the nearest and most similar planet to earth has 100 times denser atmosphere with little or no geo magnetic field space probes discovered a comet like tail that extends to orbit 42 earth itself is largely protected from the solar wind by its magnetic field which deflects most of the charged particles however some of the charged particles are trapped in the van allen radiation belt a smaller number of particles from the solar wind manage to travel as though on an electromagnetic energy transmission line to the upper atmosphere and ionosphere in the auroral zones the only time the solar wind is observable on the earth is when it is strong enough to produce phenomena such as the aurora and geomagnetic storms bright auroras strongly heat the ionosphere causing its plasma to expand into the magnetosphere increasing the size of the plasma geosphere and injecting atmospheric matter into the solar wind geomagnetic storms result when the pressure of plasmas contained inside the magnetosphere is sufficiently large to inflate and thereby distort the geomagnetic field although mars is larger than mercury and four times farther from the sun it is thought that the solar wind has stripped away up to a third of its original atmosphere leaving a layer 1 100th as dense as the it is believed the mechanism for this atmospheric stripping is gas caught in bubbles of magnetic field which are ripped off by solar winds 43 in 2015 the nasa mars atmosphere and volatile evolution maven mission measured the rate of atmospheric stripping caused by the magnetic field carried by the solar wind as it flows past mars which generates an electric field much as a turbine on earth can be used to generate electricity this electric field accelerates electrically charged gas atoms called ions in upper atmosphere and shoots them into space 44 the maven mission measured the rate of atmospheric stripping at about 100 grams 1/4 lb per second 45 moons and planetary surfaces edit swc experiment mercury the nearest planet to the sun bears the full brunt of the solar wind and since its atmosphere is vestigial and transient its surface is bathed in radiation mercury has an intrinsic magnetic field so under normal solar wind conditions the solar wind cannot penetrate its magnetosphere and particles only reach the surface in the cusp regions during coronal mass ejections however the magnetopause may get pressed into the surface of the planet and under these conditions the solar wind may interact freely with the planetary surface the moon has no atmosphere or intrinsic magnetic field and consequently its surface is bombarded with the full solar wind the project apollo missions deployed passive aluminum collectors in an attempt to sample the solar wind and lunar soil returned for study confirmed that the lunar regolith is enriched in atomic nuclei deposited from the solar wind these elements may prove useful resources for lunar colonies 46 outer limits edit main article heliopause astronomy the solar wind blows a bubble in the interstellar medium the rarefied hydrogen and helium gas that permeates the galaxy the point where the solar strength is no longer great enough to push back the interstellar medium is known as the heliopause and is often considered to be the outer border of the solar system the distance to the heliopause is not precisely known and probably depends on the current velocity of the solar wind and the local density of the interstellar medium but it is far outside pluto s orbit scientists hope to gain perspective on the heliopause from data acquired through the interstellar boundary explorer ibex mission launched in october 2008 notable events edit from may 10 to may 12 1999 advanced composition explorer ace and wind spacecraft observed a 98% decrease of solar wind density this allowed energetic electrons from the sun to flow to earth in narrow beams known as strahl which caused a highly unusual polar rain event in which a visible aurora appeared over the north pole in addition magnetosphere increased to between 5 and 6 times its normal size 47 on 13 december 2010 voyager 1 determined that the velocity of the solar wind at its location 10.8 billion miles from earth had slowed to zero we have gotten to the point where the wind from the sun which until now has always had an outward motion is no longer moving outward it is only moving sideways so that it can end up going down the tail of the heliosphere which is a comet shaped like object said voyager project scientist edward stone 48 49 see also edit space portal star portal deep space climate
