turboprop wikipedia turboprop from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search not to be confused with propfan schematic diagram showing the operation of a turboprop engine a fairchild f 27 representative of the 2nd generation of modern rolls royce dart turboprop powered aircraft after the initial success of the 1950s era vickers viscount an atr 72 a typical modern turboprop aircraft a turboprop engine is a turbine engine that drives an aircraft propeller 1 in contrast to a turbojet the exhaust gases do not contain enough energy to create significant thrust since almost all of the power is used to drive the propeller in its simplest form a turboprop consists of an intake compressor combustor turbine and a propelling nozzle air is drawn into the intake and compressed by the compressor fuel is then added to the compressed air in the combustor where the fuel air mixture then combusts the hot combustion gases expand through the turbine some of the power generated by the turbine is used to drive the compressor the rest is transmitted through the reduction gearing to the propeller further expansion of the gases occurs in the propelling nozzle where the gases exhaust to atmospheric pressure the propelling nozzle provides a relatively small proportion of the thrust generated by a turboprop contents 1 technological aspects 2 history 3 usage 4 current engines 5 see also 6 references 6.1 notes 6.2 bibliography 7 further reading 8 external links technological aspects edit flow past a turboprop engine in operation exhaust thrust in a turboprop is sacrificed in favor of shaft power which is obtained by extracting additional power up to that necessary to drive the compressor from turbine expansion owing to the additional expansion in the turbine system the residual energy in the exhaust jet is low 2 3 4 consequently the exhaust jet typically produces around or less than 10% of the total thrust 5 a higher proportion of the thrust comes from the propeller at low speeds and less at higher speeds 6 turboprops can have bypass ratios up to 50-100 7 8 9 although the propulsion airflow is less clearly defined for propellers than for fans 10 the propeller is coupled to the turbine through a reduction gear that converts the high rpm low torque output to low rpm high torque the propeller itself is normally a constant speed variable pitch type similar to that used with larger reciprocating aircraft engines citation needed unlike the small diameter fans used in turbofan jet engines the propeller has a large diameter that lets it accelerate a large volume of air this permits a lower airstream velocity for a given amount of thrust as it is more efficient at low speeds to accelerate a large amount of air by a small degree than a small amount of air by a large degree 11 12 a low disc loading thrust per disc area increases the energy efficiency and this reduces the fuel use 13 14 propellers lose efficiency as aircraft speed increases so turboprops are normally not used on high speed aircraft 2 3 4 above mach 0.6-0.7 5 however propfan engines which are very similar to turboprop engines can cruise at flight speeds approaching mach 0.75 to increase propeller efficiency a mechanism can be used to alter their pitch relative to the airspeed a variable pitch propeller also called a controllable pitch propeller can also be used to generate negative thrust while decelerating on the runway additionally in the event of an engine outage the pitch can be adjusted to a vaning pitch called feathering thus minimizing the drag of the non functioning propeller citation needed while most modern turbojet and turbofan engines use axial flow compressors turboprop engines usually contain at least one stage of centrifugal compression centrifugal compressors have the advantage of being simple and lightweight at the expense of a streamlined shape citation needed while the power turbine may be integral with the gas generator section many turboprops today feature a free power turbine on a separate coaxial shaft this enables the propeller to rotate freely independent of compressor speed 15 residual thrust on a turboshaft is avoided by further expansion in the turbine system and or truncating and turning the exhaust to produce two opposing jets apart from the above there is very little difference between a turboprop and a turboshaft citation needed 9 history edit a rolls royce rb 50 trent on a test rig at hucknall in march 1945 kuznetsov nk 12m turboprop on a tu 95 rolls royce dart turboprop engine alan arnold griffith had published a paper on turbine design in 1926 subsequent work at the royal aircraft establishment investigated axial turbine designs that could be used to supply power to a shaft and thence a propeller from 1929 frank whittle began work on centrifugal turbine designs that would deliver pure jet thrust 16 the first turboprop was designed by the hungarian mechanical engineer jendrassik 17 jendrassik published a turboprop idea in 1928 and on 12 march 1929 he patented his invention in 1938 he built a small scale 100 hp experimental gas turbine 18 the larger jendrassik cs 1 with a predicted output of 1,000 bhp was produced and tested at the ganz works in budapest between 1937 and 1941 it was of axial flow design with 15 compressor and 7 turbine stages annular combustion chamber and many other modern features first run in 1940 combustion problems limited its output to in 1941 the engine was abandoned due to war and the factory was turned over to conventional engine production the first turboprop engine that went into mass production was designed by a german engineer max adolf mueller in 1942 19 the first mention of turboprop engines in the general public press was in the february 1944 issue of the british aviation publication flight which included a detailed cutaway drawing of what a possible future turboprop engine could look like the drawing was very close to what the future rolls royce trent would look like 20 the first british turboprop engine was the rolls royce rb 50 trent a converted derwent ii fitted with reduction gear and a rotol five bladed propeller two trents were fitted to gloster meteor ee227 the sole trent meteor which thus became the first turboprop powered aircraft albeit a test bed not intended for production 21 22 it first flew on 20 september 1945 from their experience with the trent rolls royce developed the rolls royce clyde the first turboprop engine to be fully type certificated for military and civil use 23 and the dart which became one of the most reliable turboprop engines ever built dart production continued for more than fifty years the dart powered vickers viscount was the first turboprop aircraft of any kind to go into production and sold in large numbers 24 it was also the first four engined turboprop its first flight was on 16 july 1948 the first single engined turboprop aircraft was the armstrong siddeley mamba powered boulton paul balliol which first flew on 24 march 1948 25 the soviet union built on german world war ii development by junkers motorenwerke while bmw heinkel hirth and daimler benz also developed and partially tested designs citation needed while the soviet union had the technology to create the airframe for a jet powered strategic bomber comparable to b 52 stratofortress they instead produced the tupolev tu 95 bear powered with four kuznetsov nk 12 turboprops mated to eight contra rotating propellers two per nacelle with supersonic tip speeds to achieve maximum cruise speeds in excess of faster than many of the first jet aircraft and comparable to jet cruising speeds for most missions the bear would serve as their most successful long range combat and surveillance aircraft and symbol of soviet power projection throughout the end of the 20th century the usa would incorporate contra rotating turboprop engines such as the ill fated twin turbine allison t40 essentially a twinned up pair of allison t38 turboprop engines driving contra rotating propellers into a series of experimental aircraft during the 1950s with aircraft powered with the t40 like the convair r3y tradewind flying boat never entering u s navy service the first american turboprop engine was the general electric xt31 first used in the experimental consolidated vultee xp 81 26 the xp 81 first flew in december 1945 the first aircraft to use a combination of turboprop and turbojet power the technology of the earlier t38 design evolved into the allison t56 with quartets of the t56s being used to power the lockheed electra airliner its military maritime patrol derivative the p 3 orion and the widely produced c 130 hercules military transport aircraft one of the most produced turboprop engines used in civil aviation is the pratt whitney canada pt6 engine citation needed the first turbine powered shaft driven helicopter was the kaman k 225 a development of charles kaman s k 125 synchropter which used a boeing t50 turboshaft engine to power it on 11 december 1951 27 usage edit propulsive efficiency comparison for various gas turbine engine configurations compared to turbofans turboprops are most efficient at flight speeds below 390 knots because the jet velocity of the propeller and exhaust is relatively low modern turboprop airliners operate at nearly the same speed as small regional jet airliners but burn two thirds of the fuel per passenger 28 however compared to a turbojet which can fly at high altitude for enhanced speed and fuel efficiency a propeller aircraft has a lower ceiling the most common application of turboprop engines in civilian aviation is in small commuter aircraft where their greater power and reliability offsets their higher initial cost and fuel consumption turboprop powered aircraft have become popular for bush airplanes such as the cessna caravan and quest kodiak as jet fuel is easier to obtain in remote areas than avgas citation needed due to the high price of turboprop engines they are mostly used where high performance short takeoff and landing stol capability and efficiency at modest flight speeds are required turboprop engines are generally used on small subsonic aircraft but the tupolev tu 114 can reach 470 kt large military and civil aircraft such as the lockheed l 188 electra and the tupolev tu 95 have also used turboprop power the airbus a400m is powered by four europrop tp400 engines which are the third most powerful turboprop engines ever produced after the eleven megawatt output kuznetsov nk 12 and 10.4 mw output
