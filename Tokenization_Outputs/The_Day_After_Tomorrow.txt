bob beher and craig s jaeger nominated political and scientific criticism edit emmerich did not deny that his casting of a weak president and the resemblance of vice president kenneth welsh to dick cheney were intended to criticize the climate change policy of the george w bush administration 8 responding to claims of insensitivity in his inclusion of scenes of a devastated new york city less than three years after the september 11 attacks emmerich said that it was necessary to showcase the increased unity of people in the face of disaster because of the attacks 9 10 11 some scientists criticized the scientific aspects paleoclimatologist and professor of earth and planetary science at harvard university daniel p schrag said on the one hand glad that a big budget movie about something as critical as climate change on the other concerned that people will see these over the top effects and think the whole thing is a joke we are indeed experimenting with the earth in a way that been done for millions of years but not going to see another ice age at least not like that 8 j marshall shepherd a research meteorologist at the nasa goddard space flight center expressed a similar sentiment heartened that a movie addressing real climate issues but as for the science of the movie give it a d minus or an f and be concerned if the movie was made to advance a political agenda 8 according to university of victoria climatologist andrew weaver the towering inferno of climate science movies but not losing any sleep over a new ice age because impossible 8 patrick j michaels a former research professor of environmental science at the university of virginia who rejects the scientific consensus 12 on global warming called the film propaganda in a usa today editorial as a scientist i bristle when lies dressed up as science are used to influence political discourse 13 college instructor and retired nasa office of inspector general senior special agent joseph gutheinz called the day after tomorrow a cheap thrill ride which many weak minded people will jump on and stay on for the rest of their lives in a space daily editorial 14 when paleoclimatologist william hyde of duke university was asked on usenet if he would see the film he answered that he would not unless someone offered him $100. 15 subscribers to the newsgroup took up the challenge and despite protests raised the $100. 16 review on google groups criticized the depiction of weather which stopped at national borders it was to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery 17 stefan rahmstorf of the potsdam institute for climate impact research an expert on thermohaline circulation and its effect on climate said after a talk with scriptwriter jeffrey nachmanoff at the berlin preview clearly this is a disaster movie and not a scientific documentary and the film makers have taken a lot of artistic license but the film presents an opportunity to explain that some of the basic background is right humans are indeed increasingly changing the climate and this is quite a dangerous experiment including some risk of abrupt and unforeseen changes luckily it is extremely unlikely that we will see major ocean circulation changes in the next couple of decades be just as surprised as jack hall if they did occur at least most scientists think this will only become a more serious risk towards the end of the century and the consequences would certainly not be as dramatic as the superstorm depicted in the movie nevertheless a major change in ocean circulation is a risk with serious and partly unpredictable consequences which we should avoid and even without events like ocean circulation changes climate change is serious enough to demand decisive action 18 environmental activist and guardian columnist george monbiot called the day after tomorrow a great movie and lousy science 19 in 2008 yahoo movies listed the day after tomorrow as one of its top 10 scientifically inaccurate films 20 it was criticized for depicting meteorological phenomena as occurring over the course of hours instead of decades or centuries 21 a 2015 washington

overturning circulation caused by global warming 22 home media edit the film was released on vhs and dvd october 12 2004 and was released in high definition video on blu ray in north america on
