the 2010 atlantic hurricane season hurricane tomas was the latest recorded tropical cyclone on a calendar year to strike the windward islands the nineteenth named storm and twelfth hurricane of the 2010 atlantic hurricane season tomas developed from a tropical wave east of the windward islands on quickly intensifying into a hurricane it moved through the windward islands and passed over saint lucia after reaching status on the saffir simpson scale tomas quickly weakened to a tropical storm in the central caribbean sea due to strong wind shear and dry air tomas later regained hurricane status as it reorganized near the windward passage throughout the path 71 people are known to have been killed 14 of whom were in saint lucia monetary losses throughout the windward islands were estimated at mainly in saint lucia in the wake of the storm in haiti flooding intensified an ongoing cholera outbreak indirectly causing more fatalities however direct impacts from the hurricane in

wave or elongated low pressure area exited the western coast of africa on 1 it moved hastily westward across the tropical atlantic at a comparatively low latitude becoming embedded within the intertropical convergence zone 2 3 during this time the structure retained a vigorous appearance 1 the western portion contained scattered convection with strong thunderstorms as well as a broad area of rotating winds 3 on when the system was about east southeast of the windward islands the national hurricane center nhc noted favorable atmospheric conditions for tropical cyclogenesis namely light wind shear 4 the wave and its expansive convection amplified over the next two days featuring hints of spiraling rainbands 1 5 a hurricane hunters aircraft investigating the disturbance on observed a developing circulation with storm force winds at sea level 6 in light of those features the nhc estimated that the system became a tropical depression by 06 00 utc that day about southeast of barbados and further upgraded it to tropical storm tomas six hours later 1 7 on its inception tomas turned toward the northwest and decelerated 1 within a region of low wind shear and high tropical of the prime prerequisites of rapid intensification a misalignment between the low and upper level circulations impeded this strengthening potential however and at that time the nhc did not expect tomas to attain hurricane status until 36 to later 7 steered along high pressure to its north the storm retraced slightly west northwestward on its approach to the windward islands 1 8 despite the prior forecasts of moderated strengthening tomas winds sharply increased to by late 9 moreover the outflow aloft became well established in all quadrants as the convection consolidated into a prominent rain band 10 the center of the intensifying storm crossed southern barbados the next morning around 09 00 utc 1 radar images from martinique soon revealed the formation of an eye 8 tomas attained hurricane status a couple of hours later about east of saint vincent and the grenadines after hurricane hunters recorded surface winds of by that time the eye measured in diameter 11 a weakening tropical storm tomas over the atlantic on november 6 tomas continued to strengthen through as it moved generally west to west northwestward around the eye traversed the northern shores of saint vincent while the northernmost ring of the severest winds skirted saint lucia 1 subsequent reports from hurricane hunters and post storm reanalysis indicated that tomas had reached a peak intensity with wind speeds of and a minimum pressure of 982 mbar hpa 29.00 inhg during its trek across the islands making it a on the hurricane scale 1 12 although the nhc noted the potential for tomas to become a major hurricane the agency conversely observed that the hurricane had begun to suffer from southwesterly wind shear which computer models forecast to increase in the long term 12 on a combination of this shear and pockets of dry air dispersed the convection surrounding the eye initiating a weakening trend 13 tomas diminished to a tropical storm early on when the strongest thunderstorms became dislocated from the low level wind vortex by more than 1 14 tomas meandered slightly south of west for a while passing north of the abc islands overnight 1 15 although the upper wind regime relaxed into the next day with an area of deep convection briefly reblossoming near tomas center 15 the shear appeared to have already taken its toll on the storm with an increasingly diffuse and elongated structure tomas further weakened to a tropical depression at about southeast of kingston jamaica 1 16 following its deterioration tomas diverged toward the northwest over the central caribbean 1 the circulation lost further definition adjoining a wide stretch of low pressures spanning the western caribbean a hurricane hunters mission to determine whether tomas retained its status as a tropical cyclone found that the mean low level circulation had reformed to the northeast of the previous center tomas reattained tropical storm strength late on 17 18 and although the low and mid level centers were initially nonaligned slow restrengthening ensued into the next day 19 tomas turned northward ahead of an unseasonably strong deep layered trough circumnavigating the western periphery of the subtropical ridge 1 20 over a six hour period the core thunderstorm activity became much more concentrated with a corresponding quick drop in central pressure 21 while turning northeastward into the windward passage tomas regained hurricane status around on just west southwest of the western tip of haiti 1 22 over the course of the hurricane accelerated northeastward in response to the approaching trough passing right between eastern cuba and western haiti due to its proximity to land the convection became disrupted near the center 23 tomas reweakened to a tropical storm near the turks and caicos islands during a spell of moderate shear on 1 after moving through that island nation tomas briefly became a hurricane for a final time before hostile wind shear from the nearby trough fully began to take effect in conjunction with increasingly dry air the cyclone steadily weakened to a tropical storm on tomas lost its tropical characteristics the next day though it retained gale force winds as an extratropical cyclone it turned sharply eastward before curving northward accelerated by a broad cyclonic steering flow over the western atlantic the next couple of days the thomas extratropical remnant subsequently raced off into the north atlantic until it was absorbed by another extratropical system a few hundred miles south of newfoundland canada on 1 preparations edit prior to the development of tomas the nhc noted the potential for heavy rainfall and strong wind gusts to spread across the windward islands venezuela and northern guyana due to the tropical wave of which later developed into hurricane tomas 24 upon development of tropical storm tomas most of the windward islands were put under a tropical storm warning issued by their respective governments a tropical storm watch was also issued for dominica 25 six hours later as tomas was nearly a hurricane the tropical storm warning was replaced by a hurricane warning in barbados st vincent and the grenadines st lucia
