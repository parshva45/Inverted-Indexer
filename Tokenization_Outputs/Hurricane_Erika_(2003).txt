developing in the eastern gulf of mexico on august 14 under the influence of a high pressure system erika moved quickly westward and strengthened under favorable conditions it made landfall as a

map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the scale a weak surface area of low pressure detached from a frontal system on august 8 while to the east of bermuda it moved southwestward and on august 9 it generated convection as it passed beneath a cold core upper level low the surface low and the upper level low turned westward as it revolved around a common center and by august 11 the surface low developed into a trough while south of bermuda as the system rapidly continued westward much of the convection remained near the center of the upper level low preventing development of a closed surface circulation on august 13 while located near the northwestern bahamas a substantial increase in convection resulted in the upper level low building downwards to the middle levels of the troposphere coinciding with the development of an upper level anticyclone 1 a closed low level circulation nearly developed on august 14 to the east of key largo florida but it weakened due to the deep convection remaining to the north over the mid level center the mid level storm continued westward and moved across florida 1 after crossing florida hurricane hunters indicated a poorly defined circulation but with winds exceeding tropical storm strength and the system was designated as tropical storm erika late on august 14 while located west of fort myers 2

system persisted over the south central united states forcing the storm to move just south of due west at on august 15 convection organized into bands and as its winds approached hurricane strength an eye developed within the storm erika turned to the west southwest on august 16 and attained hurricane status just prior to making landfall near boca san rafael tamaulipas in northeastern mexico or about south of the united border the storm rapidly weakened over the mountainous sierra madre oriental and erika dissipated early on august 17 1 the mid level circulation maintained integrity as it crossed mexico and led to the formation of a tropical disturbance after entering the gulf of california on august 18 it turned to the northwest and weakened on august 20 3 operationally erika was never upgraded to hurricane status based on a persistent eye feature on radar and doppler weather radar estimated surface winds of the national hurricane center posthumously upgraded erika to a hurricane 1 preparations edit tropical storm erika approaching mexico on august 15 the threat of onslaught prompted the evacuation of 51 oil platforms and 3 oil rigs in the western gulf of mexico the lack of production led to a loss of production of 8,708 barrels 3 of oil per day and cubic feet 3 of natural gas per day on the day of its landfall the lack of production led to 1,979 less barrels of oil for the day or about 0.12% of the total daily production for the gulf of mexico while the loss of cubic feet 3 of gas for the day was equivalent to 0.23% of the total production 4 however due to its rapid motion the passage of the storm resulted in minimal effects on operations 5 while the storm was located in the eastern gulf of mexico on august 15 the national hurricane center issued a hurricane watch and tropical storm warning from brownsville to baffin bay texas the center also recommended a hurricane watch spanning from soto la marina tamaulipas to the international border late
