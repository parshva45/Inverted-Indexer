american colonies was sent to create a buffer south of the savannah river to protect the carolinas from spanish florida and french louisiana on february 12 1733 7 general james oglethorpe and settlers from the ship anne landed at yamacraw bluff and were greeted by tomochichi the yamacraws and indian traders john and mary musgrove mary musgrove often served as an interpreter the city of savannah was founded on that date along with the colony of georgia in 1751 savannah and the rest of georgia became a royal colony and savannah was made the colonial capital of georgia 8 by the outbreak of the american revolutionary war savannah had become the southernmost commercial port of the thirteen colonies british troops took the city in 1778 and the following year a combined force of american and french soldiers failed to rout the british at the siege of savannah the british did not leave the city until july 1782 9 savannah a prosperous seaport throughout the nineteenth century was the sixth most populous city and the prime objective of general william t sherman s march to the sea early on december 21 1864 local authorities negotiated a peaceful surrender to save savannah from destruction and union troops marched into the city at dawn 10 savannah was named for the savannah river which probably derives from variant names for the shawnee a native american people who migrated to the river in the 1680s the shawnee destroyed another native people the westo and occupied their lands at the head of the savannah navigation on the fall line near present day augusta 11 these shawnee whose native name was literally southerners 12 were known by several local variants including shawano savano savana and savannah 13 another theory is that the name savannah refers to the extensive marshlands surrounding the river for miles inland and is derived from the english term savanna a kind of tropical grassland which was borrowed by the english from spanish sabana and used in the southern colonies the spanish word comes from the taino word zabana 14 still other theories suggest that the name savannah originates from algonquian terms meaning not only southerners but perhaps salt 15 16 geography edit savannah lies on the savannah river approximately upriver from the atlantic ocean 17 according to the united states census bureau 2011 the city has a total area of 108.7
