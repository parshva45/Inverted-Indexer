cyclones portal v t e tropical cyclone forecasting is the science of forecasting where a tropical cyclone s center and its effects are expected to be at some point in the future there are several elements to tropical cyclone forecasting track forecasting intensity forecasting rainfall forecasting storm surge tornado and seasonal forecasting while skill is increasing in regard to track forecasting intensity forecasting skill remains nearly unchanged over the past several years seasonal forecasting began in the 1980s in the atlantic basin and has spread into other basins in the years

see also 10 references history edit short term edit the methods through which tropical cyclones are forecast have changed with the passage of time the first known forecasts in the western hemisphere were made by lt col william reed of the corps of royal engineers at barbados in 1847 reed mostly utilized barometric pressure measurements as the basis of his forecasts benito vines introduced a forecast and warning system based on cloud cover changes in havana during the 1870s before the early 1900s though most forecasts were done by direct observations at weather stations which were then relayed to forecast centers via telegraph it until the advent of radio in the early twentieth century that observations from ships at sea were available to forecasters the 1930s saw the usage of radiosondes in tropical cyclone forecasting the next decade saw the advent of aircraft based reconnaissance by the military starting with the first dedicated flight into a hurricane in 1943 and the establishment of the hurricane hunters in 1944 in the 1950s coastal weather radars began to be used in the united states and research reconnaissance flights by the precursor of the hurricane research division began in 1954 1 the launch of the first weather satellite tiros i in 1960 introduced new forecasting techniques that remain important to tropical cyclone forecasting to the present in the 1970s buoys were introduced to improve the resolution of surface measurements which until that point were not available at all over sea surfaces 1 long term edit in the late 1970s william gray noticed a trend of low hurricane activity in the north atlantic basin during el years he was the first researcher to make a connection between such events and positive results led him to pursue further research he found numerous factors across the globe influence tropical cyclone activity such as connecting wet periods over the african sahel to an increase in major hurricane landfalls along the united states east coast however his findings also showed inconsistencies when only looking at a single factor as a primary influence 2 utilizing his findings gray developed an objective statistical forecast for seasonal hurricane activity he predicted only the number of tropical storms hurricanes and major hurricanes foregoing specifics on tracks and potential landfalls due to the aforementioned inconsistencies 2 gray issued his first seasonal forecast ahead of the 1984 season which used the statistical relationships between tropical cyclone activity the el oscillation enso quasi biennial oscillation qbo and caribbean basin sea level pressures 3 4 the endeavor proved modestly successful 2 he subsequently issued forecasts ahead of the start of the atlantic hurricane season in may and before the peak of the season in august 5 students and colleagues joined his forecast team in the following years including christopher landsea paul w mielke jr and kenneth j berry 6 track edit see also tropical cyclone track forecasting see also tropical cyclone forecast model track errors for the atlantic basin the large scale synoptic flow determines 70 to 90 percent of a tropical motion the deep layer mean flow is considered to be the best tool in determining track direction and speed if storms are significantly sheared use of a lower level wind is a better predictor knowledge of the beta effect can be used to steer a tropical cyclone since it leads to a more northwest heading for tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere it is also best to smooth out short term wobbles of the storm center in order to determine a more accurate trajectory 7 because of the forces that affect tropical cyclone tracks accurate track predictions depend on determining the position and strength of high and low pressure areas and predicting how those areas will change during the life of a tropical system combining forecast models with increased understanding of the forces that act on tropical cyclones and a wealth of data from earth orbiting satellites and other sensors scientists have increased the accuracy of track forecasts over recent decades 8 an accurate track forecast is important because if the track forecast is incorrect forecasts for intensity rainfall storm surge and tornado threat will also be incorrect 1-2-3 rule edit hurricanes rita and philippe shown with 1-2-3 rule predictions the 1-2-3 rule 1-2-3 rule or danger area is a guideline commonly taught to mariners for severe storm specifically hurricane and tropical storm tracking and prediction it refers to the rounded long term nhc tpc forecast errors of 100-200-300 nautical miles at respectively these numbers were close to the 10 year average for the time frame 9 however these errors have decreased to near 50-100-150 as nhc forecasters become more accurate the danger area to be avoided is constructed by expanding the forecast path by a radius equal to the respective hundreds of miles plus the forecast wind radii size of the storm at those hours 10 intensity edit see also tropical cyclogenesis forecasters say they are less skillful at predicting the intensity of tropical cyclones than cyclone track 11 they attribute the lack of improvement in intensity forecasting to the complexity of tropical systems and an incomplete understanding of factors that affect their development an accurate track forecast is essential to creating accurate intensity forecasts particularly in an area with large islands such as the western north pacific and the caribbean sea as proximity to land is an inhibiting factor to developing tropical cyclones a strong hurricane typhoon cyclone can weaken if an outer eye wall forms typically around from the center of the storm choking off the convection within the inner eye wall such weakening is called an eyewall replacement cycle and is usually temporary 12 maximum potential intensity edit dr kerry emanuel created a mathematical model around 1988 called the maximum potential intensity or mpi to compute the upper limit of tropical cyclone intensity based on sea surface temperature and atmospheric profiles from the latest global model runs maps created from this equation show values of the maximum achievable intensity due to the thermodynamics of the atmosphere at the time of the last model run either 0000 or 1200 utc however mpi does not take vertical wind shear into account 13 mpi is computed using the following formula v a b e c t t 0 where v is the maximum potential velocity in meters per second t is the sea surface temperature underneath the center of the tropical cyclone t 0 is a reference temperature and a b and c are curve fit constants when a 28.2 b 55.8 and c 0.1813 the graph generated by this function corresponds to the 99th percentile of empirical tropical cyclone intensity data 14 rainfall edit r cliper for isabel 2003 see also tropical cyclone rainfall forecasting tropical cyclone rainfall forecasting is important since between inland flooding from tropical cyclones caused a majority of the fatalities from tropical cyclones in the united states 15 16 while flooding is common to tropical cyclones near a landmass there are a few factors which lead to excessive rainfall from tropical cyclones slow motion as was seen during hurricane danny and hurricane wilma can lead to high amounts the presence of topography near the coast as is the case across much of mexico haiti the dominican republic much of central america madagascar china and japan acts to magnify amounts due to upslope flow into the mountains strong upper level forcing from a trough moving through the westerlies as was the case during hurricane floyd can lead to high amounts even from systems moving at an average forward motion a combination of two of these factors could be especially crippling as was seen during hurricane mitch in central america 17 therefore an accurate track forecast is essential in order to produce an accurate tropical cyclone rainfall forecast 18 operational methods edit forecast model tracks within atcf the nhc official forecast for ernesto 2006 is light blue while the actual track is the white line over florida main articles automated tropical cyclone forecasting system and tropical cyclone tracking chart historically tropical cyclone tracking charts were used to include the past track and prepare future forecasts at regional specialized meteorological centers and tropical cyclone warning centers the need for a more modernized method for forecasting tropical cyclones had become apparent to operational weather forecasters by the mid 1980s at that time the united states department of defense was using paper maps acetate grease pencils and disparate computer programs to forecast tropical cyclones 19 the automated tropical cyclone forecasting system atcf software was developed by the naval research laboratory for the joint typhoon warning center jtwc beginning in 1986 20 and used since 1988 during 1990 the system was adapted by the national hurricane center nhc for use at the nhc national centers for environmental prediction and the central pacific hurricane center 20 21 this provided the nhc with a multitasking software environment which allowed them to improve efficiency and cut the time required to make a forecast by 25% or 1 hour 21 atcf was originally developed for use within dos before later being adapted to unix and linux 20 storm surge edit see also storm surge the main storm surge forecast model in the atlantic basin is slosh which stands for s ea l ake o verland s urge from h urricanes 22 it uses the size of a storm its intensity its forward motion and the topography of the coastal plain to estimate the depth of a storm surge at any individual grid point across the united states an accurate forecast track is required in order to produce accurate storm surge forecasts however if the landfall point is uncertain a maximum envelope of water meow map can be generated based on the direction of approach if the forecast track itself is also uncertain a maximum of maximums mom map can be generated which will show the worst possible scenario for a hurricane of a specific strength 23 tornado edit the location of most tropical cyclone related tornadoes is their northeast quadrant in the northern hemisphere and southeast quadrant in the southern hemisphere 24 like most of the other forecasts for tropical cyclone effects an accurate track forecast is required in order to produce an accurate tornado threat forecast seasonal forecast edit see also atlantic multidecadal oscillation and tropical cyclone by looking at annual variations in various climate parameters forecasters can make predictions about the overall number and intensity of tropical cyclones that will occur in a given season for example when constructing its seasonal outlooks the climate prediction center in the united states considers the effects of the el oscillation year tropical cycle wind shear over the oceans and ocean surface temperature 25 see also edit tropical cyclones portal hebert box references edit a b robert c sheets june 1990 the national hurricane
