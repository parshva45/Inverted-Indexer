only nominally circular state boundary in the united states citation needed this border extends all the way east to the low tide mark on the new jersey shore then continues south along the shoreline

petroleum sales 17 history main article history of delaware native americans before delaware was settled by european colonists the area was home to the eastern algonquian tribes known as the unami lenape or delaware who lived mostly along the coast and the nanticoke who occupied much of the southern delmarva peninsula john smith also shows two iroquoian tribes the kuskarawock tockwogh living north of the nanticoke they may have held small portions of land in the western part of the state before migrating across the chesapeake bay 18 the kuskarawocks were most likely the tuscarora the unami lenape in the delaware valley were closely related to munsee lenape tribes along the hudson river they had a settled hunting and agricultural society and they rapidly became middlemen in an increasingly frantic fur trade with their ancient enemy the minqua or susquehannock with the loss of their lands on the delaware river and the destruction of the minqua by the iroquois of the five nations in the 1670s the remnants of the lenape who wished to remain identified as such left the region and moved over the alleghany mountains by the mid 18th century generally those who did not relocate out of the state of delaware were baptized became christian and were grouped together with other persons of color in official records and in the minds of their non native american neighbors citation needed colonial delaware new sweden encounter between swedish colonists and the natives of delaware the dutch were the first europeans to settle in present day delaware in the middle region by establishing a trading post at zwaanendael near the site of lewes in 1631 within a year all the settlers were killed in a dispute with area native american tribes in 1638 new sweden a swedish trading post and colony was established at fort christina now in wilmington by peter minuit at the head of a group of swedes finns and dutch the colony of new sweden lasted for 17 years in 1651 the dutch reinvigorated by the leadership of peter stuyvesant established a fort at present day new castle and in 1655 they conquered the new sweden colony annexing it into the dutch new netherland 19 20 only nine years later in 1664 the dutch were conquered by a fleet of english ships by sir robert carr under the direction of james the duke of york fighting off a prior claim by cecil calvert 2nd baron baltimore proprietor of maryland the duke passed his somewhat dubious ownership on to william penn in 1682 penn strongly desired access to the sea for his pennsylvania province and leased what then came to be known as the lower counties on the delaware 19 from the duke penn established representative government and briefly combined his two possessions under one general assembly in 1682 however by 1704 the province of pennsylvania had grown so large that their representatives wanted to make decisions without the assent of the lower counties and the two groups of representatives began meeting on their own one at philadelphia and the other at new castle penn and his heirs remained proprietors of both and always appointed the same person governor for their province of pennsylvania and their territory of the lower counties the fact that delaware and pennsylvania shared the same governor was not unique from 1703 to 1738 new york and new jersey shared a governor 21 massachusetts and new hampshire also shared a governor for some time 22 dependent in early years on indentured labor delaware imported more slaves as the number of english immigrants decreased with better economic conditions in england the colony became a slave society and cultivated tobacco as a cash crop although english immigrants continued to arrive american revolution like the other middle colonies the lower counties on the delaware initially showed little enthusiasm for a break with britain the citizenry had a good relationship with the proprietary government and generally were allowed more independence of action in their colonial assembly than in other colonies merchants at the port of wilmington had trading ties with the british so it was that new castle lawyer thomas mckean denounced the stamp act in the strongest terms and kent county native john dickinson became the penman of the revolution anticipating the declaration of independence patriot leaders thomas mckean and caesar rodney convinced the colonial assembly to declare itself separated from british and pennsylvania rule on june 15 1776 the person best representing majority george read could not bring himself to vote for a declaration of independence only the dramatic overnight ride of caesar rodney gave the delegation the votes needed to cast vote for independence initially led by john haslet delaware provided one of the premier regiments in the continental army known as the delaware blues and nicknamed the blue chicks in august 1777 general sir william howe led a british army through delaware on his way to a victory at the battle of brandywine and capture of the city of philadelphia the only real engagement on delaware soil was the battle of bridge fought on september 3 1777 at bridge in new castle county following the battle of brandywine wilmington was occupied by the british and state president john mckinly was taken prisoner the british remained in control of the delaware river for much of the rest of the war disrupting commerce and providing encouragement to an active loyalist portion of the population particularly in sussex county because the british promised slaves of rebels freedom for fighting with them escaped slaves flocked north to join their lines 23 following the american revolution statesmen from delaware were among the leading proponents of a strong central united states

population boom the economies of these colonies were chiefly based on tobacco culture and were increasingly dependent on slave labor for its intensive cultivation most of the english colonists arrived as indentured servants under contracts to work as laborers for a fixed period to pay for their passage in the early years the line between indentured servants and african slaves or laborers was fluid and the working classes often lived closely together most of the free african american families in delaware before the revolution had migrated from maryland to find more affordable land they were descendants chiefly of relationships or marriages between white servant women and enslaved servant or free african or african american men 24 as the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in england more slaves were imported for labor and the caste lines hardened at the end of the colonial period the number of enslaved people in delaware began to decline shifts in the agriculture economy from tobacco to mixed farming created less need for slaves labor local methodists and quakers encouraged slaveholders to free their slaves following the american revolution and many did so in a surge of individual manumissions for idealistic reasons by 1810 three quarters of all blacks in delaware were free when john dickinson freed his slaves in 1777 he was largest slave owner with 37 slaves by 1860 the largest slaveholder owned 16 slaves 25 although attempts to abolish slavery failed by narrow margins in the legislature in practical terms the state had mostly ended the practice by the 1860 census on the verge of the civil war 91.7% of the black population were free 26 1,798 were slaves as compared to 19,829 free colored persons 27 the independent black denomination was chartered by freed slave peter spencer in 1813 as the union church of africans this followed the 1793 establishment of the african methodist episcopal church in philadelphia which had ties to the methodist episcopal church until 1816 spencer built a church in wilmington for the new denomination 28 this was renamed the african union first colored methodist protestant church and connection more commonly known as the a u m p church begun by spencer in 1814 the annual gathering of the big august quarterly still draws people together in a religious and cultural festival the oldest such cultural festival in the nation delaware voted against secession on january 3 1861 and so remained in the union while most delaware citizens who fought in the war served in the regiments of the state some served in companies on the confederate side in maryland and virginia regiments delaware is notable for being the only slave state from which no confederate regiments or militia groups were assembled delaware essentially freed the few slaves that were still in bondage shortly after the civil war but rejected the 13th 14th and 15th amendments to the
