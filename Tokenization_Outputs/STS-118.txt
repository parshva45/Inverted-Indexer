shuttle program sts 117 sts 120 sts 118 was a space shuttle mission to the international space station iss flown by the orbiter endeavour sts 118 lifted off on 8 august 2007 from launch pad 39a at kennedy space center ksc florida and landed at the shuttle landing facility at ksc on 21 august 2007 this was the first flight of endeavour since sts 113 in november 2002 which was also the last successful shuttle flight before sts 107 which culminated in the loss of columbia when it disintegrated during reentry sts 118 pilot charles hobaugh had been the entry team capcom for sts 107 columbia would have been chosen for this mission 4 for what would have been its 29th mission and its first and likely its only mission to the iss the mission is also referred to as iss 13a 1 by the iss program the mission added two more components to the iss and brought supplies for its crew during and after the mission the media focused heavily on a small puncture in the heat shield created by a piece of insulation foam that came off the external tank during liftoff though the foam impact that ultimately destroyed columbia caused more damage and was in a critical area ksc launch director michael d leinbach mentioned in the post flight news conference that upon initial inspection on the ground endeavour appears to be the cleanest post flight orbiter since return to flight 5 on 31 august 2007 nasa reported that the damaged tiles had been removed in the orbiter processing facility and engineers had found no evidence of heat related damage to the orbiter itself 6 contents 1 crew 1.1 crew

specialist educator due to the presence of barbara morgan the educator astronaut project is the successor to nasa s teacher in space project which ended with the space shuttle challenger disaster in 1986 8 also the official sts 118 mission patch included a flame of knowledge that represented the importance of education and honored teachers and students everywhere the tip of the flames touched name on the patch 9 however nasa administrator michael d griffin clarified at a post mission press conference that morgan was not considered a mission specialist educator but rather a standard mission

columbia sts 118 would have marked that 29th flight and its first visit to the international space station however the space shuttle columbia disaster altered the planned flight schedules and the mission was rescheduled for endeavour sts 118 served as endeavour s return to flight after a planned orbiter re fit and maintenance period that resulted in over 200 modifications to the orbiter 11 one of the most important modifications that debuted during sts 118 is an upgraded power distribution module the station shuttle power transfer system sspts sspts allows endeavour to tap into the iss power supply converting up to eight kilowatts of electrical power from 120 volts direct current 120vdc iss main voltage to the 28vdc system used by the orbiter sspts was outfitted to the iss pressurized mating adapter -2 pma2 during sts 116 these upgrades will allow orbiters to remain docked at the station for an additional three to four mission days 12 13 14 by saving cryogenic liquid hydrogen and oxygen needed to run the fuel cells which generate electricity aboard the orbiter oxygen and hydrogen tank capacity is a major factor limiting the duration of orbiter free flights other systems debuting on this flight were a three string gps system which replaces the three tactical air navigation units used to guide the shuttle and calculate its position during reentry and landing and the new advanced health management system which keeps an eye on the three main engines ssmes during liftoff and will shut them down before any catastrophic damage might develop all ssmes had their own computers to regulate monitor and shut them down in case of trouble the new system extends and improves the monitoring capability for increased safety endeavour also received several systems that the other orbiters had already been equipped with such as a glass cockpit improved wing leading edge sensors and the obss 11 sts 118 included mission specialist barbara morgan the first mission specialist educator morgan trained as the backup to christa mcauliffe teacher in space candidate from 1985 to 1986 mcauliffe was killed in the space shuttle challenger accident on 28 january 1986 while mcauliffe and morgan were classified as spaceflight participants and not as mission specialists in 1986 after the teacher in space project was canceled morgan assumed the duties of teacher in space designee and continued to work with education division until her selection as first mission specialist educator in 1998 morgan completed two years of training and evaluation and began official duties in 2000 15 an educator astronaut is a fully trained astronaut who performs all the same duties that a regular astronaut does 16 morgan became the first mission specialist educator in space on sts 118 and will share what she learned from the experience with students during and after her flight whether teaching school or whether training as an astronaut you put all you can into it and get the most out of it barbara morgan 17 the mission marked 150th manned us space launch 119th space shuttle flight 22nd international space station assembly mission 20th flight of endeavour 94th post

finished around 11 00 edt the ice team began their inspection of the orbiter to ensure no ice was on the orbiter or the fuel tank something unlikely due to the unusually warm conditions as launch time approached their inspection lasted about 40 minutes shorter than the usual two hours the crew departed for the operations checkout o c building for the launch pad at 14 46 edt 18 46 utc and arrived at the pad at 15 02 edt 19 02 utc launch occurred at 18 36 42 edt 22 36 42 utc countdown and launch notes the ice team members discovered a small crack in the foam surrounding the external fuel tank during their preflight examination after a review by the mission management team it was concluded that there was no debris issue regarding the crack and the tank was safe to fly a problem with the switches associated with the crew hatch required a second and third hatch closure attempt hatch closure was completed and verified at 17 23 edt 21 23 utc the high definition video camera used to inspect the shuttle from kennedy space center during launch failed prior to liftoff the launch team decided that the cameras on the external tank and the orbiter would be sufficient for observations and went on to launch without it the final forecast predicted 80% go for launch weather 21 launch director mike leinbach conducted his t 9 poll and declared endeavour a go for launch at 18 26 edt 22

and performed a variety of other payload activation procedures before entering their scheduled sleep shift at 04 36 utc edt 9 august 2007 thursday 9 august flight day 2 edit the shuttle crew spent most of the day inspecting the outer hull and the heat shield during the mission status briefing deputy shuttle program manager and mission management team chairman john shannon reported that during launch approximately nine pieces of foam were observed breaking off the external fuel tanks three of these struck the shuttle all three strikes are considered to be minor in nature 22 friday 10 august flight day 3 edit preliminary image of damage to the thermal protective tiles endeavour successfully docked with the international space station at 18 02 utc 14 02 edt approximately an hour before docking endeavour performed the one degree per second backflip called the rendezvous pitch maneuver rpm so the iss crew members could take digital pictures of the heat shield of the orbiter the images were then analyzed by image analysis team as well as the mission management team to inspect the integrity of the heat shield following a series of leak checks the hatches were opened at 20 04 utc 16 04 edt and the expedition 15 crew welcomed the sts 118 crew aboard the station after preliminary review of the photos taken by the expedition 15 crew during the rpm an area of interest was discovered on the underside of the shuttle an area behind the right landing gear door covered with black silica tiles 23 the tile directly aft of the door had a 3.5 inches by 2 inches gouge in it while the tile was penetrated the underlying felt backing was not nasa noted in the press conference that launch time video confirmed a foam strike this area is less critical than the leading edge reinforced carbon carbon tiles that were damaged in the space shuttle columbia disaster but did cause concern for the mission management team a focused inspection was scheduled for 12 august 2007 to determine whether a patch attempt would be undertaken by the astronauts during an eva 24 nasa once reported that pieces of foam are bound to and have fallen off of the external tank during the eight and a half minute ride to orbit extraordinarily an unprecedented three hundred pieces of foam once struck the underside of an orbiter during launch the crew activated the station to shuttle power transfer system sspts after docking 25 the sspts transfers electrical power from the station to the shuttle allowing the shuttle to conserve its own power generating resources an extension of the mission from 11 to 14 days was dependent on proper operation of the sspts saturday 11 august flight day 4 edit astronaut rick mastracchio works on the outside of the international space station during eva 1 on 11 august at 21 45 utc rick mastracchio and dave williams started the first eva of the mission installing the s5 truss to the station increasing the total mass of the iss to 232,693 kilograms the eva duration was 6 hours and 17 minutes and all objectives were successfully completed during the mission status press conference lead iss flight director joel montalbano reported that the sspts was working well and the recommendation to the mission management team will be to extend the mission to the planned 14 day mission mission management team chair john shannon reported after additional analysis it appeared that a piece of foam came off the external tank in the area of the feed line and bounced off a nearby strut resulting in a hit to the underside an almost identical section of foam was lost on sts 115 but did not strike the orbiter john reported after further review of photos taken on flight day three they do not feel the damage went all the way through the tile but focused inspection is still planned for flight day five and decisions would not be made until more information is obtained five specific areas will be inspected during focused inspection and with the data gathered thermal testing can be done to determine what actions if any need to be taken overall john shannon classified the foam loss as a concern but only with regards to the history that the specific area has with regards to foam loss in past missions shannon reported that analysis would be complete by flight day 7 at the latest john shannon also reported that the possible protruding gap filler noticed on flight day 3 was reviewed further and was determined to be shim stock which will burn off in the upper atmosphere and poses no issues for re entry sunday 12 august flight day 5 edit high resolution image of thermal protective tiles taken during focused inspection on flight day five the crew carried out the focused inspection without any problems and at 20 56 utc the crews of endeavour and expedition 15 were notified that the sspts was working as expected and the mission was officially extended to the planned 14 day mission commander scott kelly replied great news thanks 26 in the daily mission status briefing lead flight director matt abbott announced the official extension of the mission that the sspts was working as planned and they were pleased with the data gathered during the focused inspection on sunday mission management team chairman john shannon confirmed the decision of the mission management team to extend the mission to 14 days and to add a fourth eva was unanimous he noted that the addition of sspts will be a valuable new tool providing not only extended missions but also the ability to provide the space station with additional supplies of oxygen water and other resources shannon reported on the focused inspection confirming that good laser data and imagery was obtained and they resolved several areas of interest classifying them as of no concern one area of interest was two adjacent thermal plates on the underside that had a gouge that appeared to be deeper than would allow them to rule it out nasa would use data from the focused inspection to model the area and do thermal analysis of the area 27 they will use the data to mimic the damage with sample tiles at johnson space center and using a variety of testing methods possible courses of action would then be evaluated no decision would be made until all data had been received and reviewed shannon did report that following sts 118 nasa will do a thorough review of the history of foam loss from the area of the external tank since sts 114 analysis and testing would be done and any speculation as to a future course of action would not be made until all the information was available monday 13 august flight day 6 edit rick mastracchio and dave williams completed the second spacewalk successfully achieving all of the scheduled activities during the eva they removed a new cmg from endeavour s payload bay and moved it to the z1 truss where they removed the failed cmg after installing the new cmg they placed the failed cmg on an external stowage platform where it will remain until it is returned to earth with mission sts 122 after initial testing on the ground nasa reported the new cmg was functioning normally 28 during the eva mastracchio reported an eva suit alarm indicating high levels of co 2 but after reviewing all indicators and sensors nasa confirmed it was an instrumentation issue and the suit itself was fine at the mission status briefing nasa reported the suit would be used on future spacewalks and the issue was not of any concern 29 during the mission management briefing john shannon discussed heat shield and re entry issues he reported that after initial modeling they believe the majority of heating will be on the backside of the gouge and not into the filler bar side which was the preferable situation he reiterated that it was a complicated aerodynamic shape and they wanted to be sure the flow would concentrate in the back well of the hole the engineers and analysts would continue to do additional flow modeling after which they would take the data into the arc jet testing facility for additional analysis the first preliminary arc jet tests would be performed monday night shannon reported a team four had been assembled along with the operations and engineering teams to assist in data analysis the teams will look at options for repair if required and make recommendations to the mission management team after the analysis of tests and data shannon stated he had no doubt that if a repair was required the crew could execute it without significant impact to the mission timeline he reiterated that this was not a catastrophic damage situation but simply a situation that they would prefer to fix if possible similar to the oms blanket issue during sts 117 in june 2007 30 there are three different on orbit repair techniques available to the crew both post columbia return to flight missions experimented with various repair materials and techniques and the sts 118 crew has trained for those procedures tuesday 14 august flight day 7 edit backdropped by earth endeavour s canadarm moves the external stowage platform esp 3 the endeavour crew awoke on tuesday to the voices of tracy family singing happy birthday to her the two crews successfully removed the esp 3 from endeavour s payload bay and installed it onto the p3 truss they also continued with transfer activities and several crew members took time out to have two public affairs events one of them answering questions from the discovery center in boise idaho 31 during an interview with cbs commander kelly stated that he was not concerned about the tile damage and would be comfortable with any decision nasa made my understanding is this tile damage is not an issue of the safety of the crew not concerned with our safety 32 the main reason for fixing it he noted would be to assist with processing once the orbiter was back at the kennedy space center during the mission management team briefing kirk shireman deputy international space station program manager reported that the external stowage platform installation went well the new cmg was working well and handover of attitude control directly from the shuttle to the station was completed without problems in addition a new russian computer was installed on the station and testing of the system would be performed in late august he also mentioned several of the experiments that were launched with sts 118 and reported all experiments were proceeding well shireman also noted that as of 15 17 utc the zarya module of the station had orbited the earth 50,000 times john shannon reported that the orbiter systems were in excellent shape and had no issues with regards to the remaining area of tile damage on the underside of the orbiter shannon reported that initial thermal analysis had been completed computational fluid dynamics testing at ames research center had been done and the preliminary results were cautiously optimistic testing at the arc jet facility would continue tuesday night shannon stated they would go through complete eva scenario testing at the neutral buoyancy lab to help develop the eva procedures if needed wednesday 15 august flight day 8 edit this article needs to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information december 2008 damaged glove rick mastracchio and clayton anderson began the third eva of the mission at 14 37 utc during the eva they successfully relocated a ceta cart retrieved the p6 transponder relocated the s band antenna from p6 to p1 and installed a new s band baseband signal processor and transponder on the p1 truss during a routine glove inspection mastracchio noticed a possible tear on the thumb of his left glove 33 to be safe nasa managers decided to end the spacewalk at 20 05 and examination and photography of the glove was performed during suit removal the spacewalk accomplished all but one of the tasks misse retrieval 34 on the station the crewmembers continued with transfer activities during the mission management team briefing joel montalbano reported that the issue with suit was never a danger to the suit integrity and the decision to cut the eva short was one of precaution extended photography was performed and additional analysis will be completed prior to the fourth eva montalbano reported that the fourth eva would be no earlier than 18 august 2007 35 lead spacewalk officer paul boehm agreed that the eva went well the major objectives were completed and he reiterated that at no time was suit in any danger of leaking eva office manager steve doering reported on the details regarding the issue with glove the eva inspection procedure was implemented following sts 116 when a cut was found on robert curbeam s glove following an eva the eva suit comprises five layers of material and the second layer called vectran is a high strength material resistant to tearing tear was into the vectran layer prior to the next eva video analysis will be done of the path mastracchio took during the spacewalk in an attempt to discover where the tear may have occurred an analysis of glove during the previous two evas will also be performed john shannon reported that no decision had been made regarding the tile damage on the underside of the orbiter but the fourth eva was postponed to at least 18 august 2007 the management team would continue to analyze the potential risks of repair to the underside of the orbiter as well as any other areas of risk shannon reported the results of the arc jet testing showed some erosion into the backside of the adjacent tile upon re entry but the erosion did not go through the entire layer of the tile preliminary results were encouraging but additional testing would be performed on wednesday night shannon reported that the final decision would most likely be made on thursday 36 shannon said i am cautiously optimistic that repairs will not be needed 37 astronaut clay anderson expedition 15 flight engineer uses a digital camera to expose a photo of his helmet visor during the third eva thursday 16 august flight day 9 edit the station and shuttle crews continued transfer activities on flight day 9 as well as eva preparations which included tps repair procedure review in case nasa decided a repair was necessary 38 39 mission specialists barbara morgan and alvin drew participated in an education event in the morning with students at the challenger center for space science education in alexandria virginia the event was hosted by dr june scobee rogers wife of challenger s commander dick scobee and founding chairman of the challenger center morgan and drew also spoke to reporters from the associated press reuters and idaho public television 40 during the interview with reuters drew stated been talking to the engineers who have been analyzing this far more than we have in space and they seem to feel that the biggest danger is more to just being able to re use endeavour once it gets back on the ground they seem to be confident and i trust their confidence that we can get home safely even with the divot that we have in the belly 41 morgan added we have a lot of faith in the program and do what the engineers decide is the best thing for us to do we have all confidence going to be able to do the right thing at 01 00 utc 17 august 2007 capcom shane kimbrough notified commander kelly that the mission management team decided that no repair to the damaged tile on the underside of the orbiter would be required 42 43 during the mission management team briefing john shannon announced the unanimous decision that an eva to repair the damaged tile was not required and the tile damage on the underside of the orbiter was not a threat to crew safety however the spacewalk to repair the damage could pose a variety of risks and those risks weighed heavily into the final decision he noted the arc jet tests actually showed a higher degree of damage than the orbiter would sustain during re entry so the tests were helpful in showing the worst possible damage and still did not damage the tile during testing enough to warrant repair 44 shannon did note that the jsc engineering independent group advised nasa managers that repairing the damage on orbit could assist with mission turn around time once the orbiter was on the ground shannon noted that the risks associated with in flight repair outweighed the possible delay in processing the orbiter following the mission he stated that normal turn around time would not be compromised as most orbiters have at least 60 tiles replaced after each mission so the situation would not be any different than past missions 45 when pressed during the briefing by a reporter as to the chance of shuttle or crew loss shannon reported i am 100 percent comfortable that the work that has been done has accurately characterized the damage and that we will have a very successful re entry he stated that over 200 people were involved in the decision representing over 30 organizations including nasa ames research center langley research center jet propulsion laboratory ksc jsc and that all the groups combined came to the same decision shannon reported that the glove issue encountered during eva three had been discussed and stated that analysis would be continued in advance of eva four on saturday the crew does have a spare set of gloves if needed shannon reported on a micro meteoroid debris strike discovered on the window of the orbiter which was 1 millimeter in depth shannon noted that it was consistent with previous damage sustained on past missions analysis would be conducted regarding this issue using photographs sent down by the crew early thursday morning the final item discussed was hurricane dean which was heading towards the caribbean sea and projected to move into the gulf of mexico contingency procedures and plans were in place but shannon did not anticipate it would affect the timeline at all friday 17 august flight day 10 edit the station and shuttle crews had a relatively quiet day on flight day 10 continuing transfer operations and doing some troubleshooting on a communication system between the shuttle and station the two crews took some time out to have a joint news conference with us and canadian news agencies and took the official combined crew portrait 46 when asked by reporters on the ground whether the crew agreed with decision to return without repairing the damage to endeavour s underside commander kelly replied we agree absolutely 100 percent with the decision to not repair the damage 47 during the mission status briefing lead flight director matt abbott discussed the ongoing preparations and plans with regards to hurricane dean and reported nasa was watching the track closely if required contingency plans are available while the timeline could be changed if required no decision was made and the mission was proceeding as planned 48 deputy iss program manager kirk shireman reported the s band system relocated during the third eva was working well and the sspts provided enough oxygen to be able to completely fill all reserves on the station shireman commented that transfer operations were approximately 75% complete eva office manager steve doering reported on the decision to proceed with eva the team analyzed the video downlinked from the third eva and the review showed no evidence of any specific event that would indicate a sharp edge or excessive wear a review of the manufacturing of the gloves was done and no concerns were identified the paths taken by astronauts during spacewalks were reviewed identifying common paths between the third eva and planned eva and the crew was notified of the common locations to identify areas where additional glove inspections would be performed on saturday overall the final eva would be less hand intensive than the previous spacewalks and the conclusion following the analysis was that eva would go ahead as planned 49 saturday 18 august flight day 11 edit one of the retrieved misse experiments nasa managers decided overnight to shorten the fourth eva by two hours as a precaution due to hurricane dean s continued path into the gulf of mexico 50 the eva duration was five hours and 2 minutes with a total eva time of 23 hours and 15 minutes for the mission the eva accomplished three primary objectives and one get ahead task two tasks were deferred plans to tie down debris shields on the destiny lab and relocation of a tool box 51 during the spacewalk williams and anderson got a good look at hurricane dean and were both awed at the sight holy smoke was initial comment man impressive williams replied anderson added only impressive when not coming towards you 52 transfer activities were completed ahead of schedule and both crews worked hard to get everything transferred back to endeavour after the spacewalk dave williams set two records during his third eva he is the canadian with the most spacewalks 3 and he passed canadian astronaut chris hadfield in total eva time williams ended eva with a total of 17 hours 47 minutes of extravehicular time 53 view of hurricane dean taken from the international space station during the fourth sts 118 eva during the mission status briefing launch integration manager leroy cain reported that the mission management team decided to take extra precautions in preparation for the storm and sts 118 would be cut short a day 54 in the event of a hurricane evacuation in houston an emergency command center would need to be set up while it was a contingency set in place for years nasa would prefer to avoid that situation to that end cain reported the eva was shortened and the hatch closure would be done saturday evening rather than sunday as planned undocking would be at 11 57 utc sunday with the first ksc landing opportunity on 21 august 2007 at 19 46 a short farewell ceremony was performed followed by hatch closure at 20 10 utc tentative ksc landing time would be est 16 30 utc 55 sunday 19 august flight day 12 edit the international space station moves away from space shuttle endeavour during sts 118 endeavour successfully undocked from the international space station at 11 56 utc saturday nasa managers decided the station fly around that is normally performed following each mission would not be conducted in order to give the shuttle crew more free time during flight day 12 after several long work days the mission control team felt the crew needed some downtime before the landing process began after undocking two 4 second firings of the reaction control system were performed in order to distance endeavour from the station and move to a position above it there the crew deployed the robotic arm beginning late inspection of the reinforced carbon carbon tiles on the nose cap and wing leading edges 56 at the mission status briefing matt abbott reported the undocking was flawless and the late inspection was completed successfully monday would be a standard pre landing day with checkout of the various systems on endeavour as well as an educational media event entry flight director steve stich and the entry team will take over mission duties tonight in preparation for landing john shannon reported the mission management team meeting went well the landing plan was reviewed and all teams reported go for landing on tuesday the latest track for hurricane dean was favorable for the houston area the storm seemed to be swinging farther south than originally expected nasa managers were optimistic that contingency plans would not be needed final decisions regarding alternate plans would not be made until monday but shannon noted that white sands space harbor landing facility would be removed as an alternate site edwards air force base and kennedy shuttle landing facility would be the two sites evaluated on monday monday 20 august flight day 13 edit on monday with the shuttle approximately 68 miles behind the international space station the crew of endeavour performed a variety of check out tests in preparation for entry configured the spacehab module for entry and did some last minute stowage kelly and hobaugh worked with the shuttle landing simulator on board practicing the anticipated landing tracks kelly williams and morgan took some time out to talk to students at the canadian school la ronge in saskatchewan during the mission status briefing entry flight director steve stich reported the track of hurricane dean would not require the activation of contingency plans and the forecast looked favorable for a tuesday landing at kennedy shuttle landing facility 57 there were also two opportunities for a florida landing with the first opportunity beginning with a deorbit burn at 15 25 utc and landing at 16 32 utc the second opportunity would call for a deorbit burn at 17 00 utc with landing at 18 16 utc weather was not expected to interfere with landing with a forecast of high clouds but no inclement weather if the second landing opportunity was taken the shuttle would fly directly over hurricane dean although it would be well above any effects of the storm nasa did plan to call up edwards air force base as the backup site which had two opportunities on tuesday but the plan was to attempt a ksc landing and if both opportunities were waved off nasa would decide whether to wait a day and try for a wednesday landing at ksc if wednesday opportunities at florida were waved off due to weather a landing at edwards air force base would be attempted 58 tuesday 21 august flight day 14 landing edit endeavour landing at kennedy space center the crew of endeavour went right to work after waking up on tuesday completing the close out of the spacehab module and getting into the deorbit preparations timeline 59 they closed payload bay doors transitioned the vehicle computers to landing software mode and donned their reentry suits at 14 30 utc the crew was given the go to begin fluid loading this was done to assist with the ability to adjust to gravity and to prevent hypotension after landing at 12 30 utc the space flight meteorology group reported to entry team flight director steve stich that the weather forecast was a go the weather at kennedy space center showed only scattered showers moving away from the landing facility and cross winds were not expected to be a problem at 15 08 utc the crew was given a go for the deorbit burn and the auxiliary power units were started at 15 20 utc the 4 minute engine burn was successfully completed at 15 28 utc slowing endeavour by approximately 252 miles per hour 405 kilometres and adjusting the trajectory correctly for landing radar acquisition of endeavour through mila happened at 16 19 utc at 16 20 utc the shuttle had passed the area of peak heating with no issues reported on board main landing gear touchdown occurred at 16 32 16 utc with nose gear touchdown at 16 32 29 utc the orbiter came to a complete stop at 16 33 20 utc 60 upon wheel stop capcom christopher ferguson told the crew congratulations given a new meaning to the term higher education 61 damaged tile in the belly of endeavour during post landing inspection initial post landing inspection of the orbiter showed very little additional damage to the thermal tiles affected by the foam strike during launch barbara morgan did not exit the crew transport vehicle with the rest of the crew she remained on board the vehicle to receive additional medical tests and would return to the astronaut crew quarters in that vehicle 62 the remaining six crew members briefly examined the orbiter doing the traditional post flight walkaround posed for photos and then returned to the crew quarters in the astrovan during the post landing briefing nasa administrator michael d griffin reported that the international space station was approximately 60% completed following sts 118 griffin also stressed the importance of space exploration and added that the damaged tile on the underside of the orbiter did very well during re entry associate administrator for spaceflight operations william h gerstenmaier reported the damage was actually less than what the arc jet testing produced a situation that nasa anticipated and managers had earlier stressed that arc jets show worst possible damage launch and entry flight director mike leinbach stressed how pleased he was with the mission and with the condition of the vehicle following re entry he stated it was one of the cleanest vehicles the managers have seen since the return to flight policies were implemented if not the cleanest at the end of the briefing griffin commented to the media who focused on barbara morgan being the first teacher in space that morgan was not technically a teacher in space nor was she an educator astronaut he stated she was accepted as a mission specialist before the new class of mission specialist educators were selected in 2004 and nasa considers her to be a mission specialist who was once a teacher 10 however nasa does refer to morgan as a mission specialist educator in a number of interviews so the terms seem to be interchangeable to most if not to griffin during the post landing crew press conference kelly was asked did the tile damage enter your mind at all during re entry and what did you think about it once you got a look during the walkaround reply was i thought about it but only because i knew be asked about it i worry about it at all i was underwhelmed by it 63 you know a great sense of pride to be able to be involved in a human endeavor that takes us all a little bit farther when you look down and see our earth and you realize what we are trying to do as a human race pretty profound
