copes with nearly 20 years in prison a parallel plot follows lesra martin an underprivileged afro american youth from brooklyn now living in toronto in the 1980s the child becomes interested in life and circumstances after reading autobiography he convinces his canadian foster family to commit themselves to case the story culminates with legal successful pleas to judge h lee sarokin of the united states district court for the district of new jersey in 1966 rubin the hurricane carter was a top ranked middleweight boxer expected by many fans to become the greatest boxing champion when three victims specifically the bartender and a male and a female customer were shot to death in a bar in paterson new jersey carter and his friend john artis driving home from another club in paterson were stopped and interrogated by the police although the police asserted that carter and artis were innocent and thus were never suspects a man named alfred bello a suspect himself in the killings claimed that carter and artis were present at the time of the murders on the basis of testimony carter and artis were convicted of the triple homicide in the club carter was given three consecutive life sentences throughout the trial carter proclaimed his innocence claiming that his race his boxing career and status and his work as a civil rights activist were the real reasons for his conviction eight years later bello and a co suspect arthur bradley who also claimed that carter was present at the scene of the crimes renounced and recanted their testimony however carter and artis were convicted once again afterwards the plot goes back to lesra martin who works with a trio of canadian activists to push the state of new jersey to reexamine case in 1985 a federal district court ruled that the prosecution in second trial committed grave constitutional violations and that his conviction was based on racism rather than facts as a result carter was finally freed and he summed up his story by saying hate got me into this place love got me out 2 cast edit denzel washington as rubin the hurricane carter vicellous reon shannon as lesra martin deborah kara unger as lisa peters liev

17 2000 two weeks prior to its opening in north america a premiere for the hurricane was held at the mann village theater in los angeles many of the depicted people were in attendance when asked about

total receipts for the run were $50,668,906. in its widest release the film was featured in 2,148 theaters it closed the week of april 14 2000 the motion picture was in circulation sixteen weeks 9 critical response edit reviews were positive with much praise to denzel performance the film has an 83% approval rating at rotten tomatoes based on 113 reviews the consensus reads thanks in large part to one of denzel most powerful on screen performances the hurricane is a moving inspirational sports drama even if it takes few risks in telling its story 10 roger ebert film critic for the chicago sun times liked the film and the acting and wrote this is one of denzel great performances on a par with his work in malcolm x washington as hurricane carter is spare focused filled with anger and pride this is strong stuff and i was amazed after feeling some impatience in the earlier reaches of the film to find myself so deeply absorbed in its second and third acts until at the end i was blinking at tears what affects me emotionally at the movies is never sadness but goodness 11 regarding the fictionalized aspects of the film ebert discussed why that is often the case in films several people have told me dubiously that they heard the movie was fictionalized well of course it was those who seek the truth about a man from the film of his life might as well seek it from his loving grandmother most biopics like most grandmothers see the good in a man and demonize his enemies they pass silently over his imprudent romances in dramatizing his victories they simplify them and they provide the best roles to the most interesting characters if they we pay to see them he added the hurricane is not a documentary but a parable in which two lives are saved by the power of the written word 11 film critic stephen holden writing for the new york times had mixed views of the film but did like the acting he wrote in telling the story of mr protracted and ultimately successful fight for freedom and justice the hurricane rides to glory on an astonishing performance by denzel washington that is to say mr washington leans into an otherwise schlocky movie and slams it out of the ballpark if his hurricane is an inspiring portrait of nobility it is because the actor never conceals the demons of fury and despair gnawing beneath his forcefully articulate surface 12 holden was forthright about the veracity of the film writing the film is so eager to stir us up that it thinks little of bending the facts for dramatic effect among its most egregious distortions is its depiction of mr 1964 middleweight title match with joey giardello the movie which has fine naturalistic boxing sequences inaccurately portrays the fight as lost by carter solely because of the judges racism the taking of such license of course adds an extra jolt of drama but when these and other distortions and exaggerations are added up worth wondering if that self congratulatory glow the movie leaves us with has been gotten far too easily and at what cost 12 jewison considers the hurricane his best work 13 accolades edit wins edit berlin international film festival prize of the guild of german rt

film was criticized for misrepresenting many of the facts of life and the case itself as documented in both his criminal and military records and police reports and court documentation such critics include herald news reporter cal deal 16 larry elder 17 thomas clough barbara burns the daughter of victim hazel tanis george kimball of the irish times 18 milan simonich of the pittsburgh post gazette lona manning 19 the new york times reporter robert lipsyte 20 paul mulshine of the star ledger and jack newfield of the new york post who stated i knew rubin carter attended his fights covered his retrial and i see much reality on the screen citation needed the new yorker film critic david denby called it false evasive and factually very thin a liberal fairytale 21 lawsuit edit former middleweight world champion joey giardello sued the producers for libel over the depiction of his fight with carter as a racist fix this is a joke he told the new york daily news he never hit me that much in 15 rounds virtually every boxing expert then and now will tell you i won the fight referee robert polis who scored the fight in favor stated they portrayed joey giardello as an incompetent fighter i thought it was ludicrous 22 even carter himself agreed that giardello was the rightful victor 23 eventually the case was settled out of court with the producers paying the retired champion damages and with jewison agreeing to make a statement on the dvd version that giardello no doubt was a great fighter 24 see also edit denzel washington filmography references edit a b the hurricane
