and catena trioxygen or trioxygen is an inorganic molecule with the chemical formula o 3 it is a pale blue gas with a distinctively pungent smell it is an allotrope of oxygen that is much less stable than the diatomic allotrope o 2 breaking down in the lower atmosphere to o 2 or dioxygen ozone is formed from dioxygen by the action of ultraviolet light and also atmospheric electrical discharges and is present in very low concentrations throughout the atmosphere stratosphere its concentration is highest in the ozone layer region of the atmosphere which absorbs most of the ultraviolet uv radiation odour is sharp reminiscent of chlorine and detectable by many people at concentrations of as little as 100 ppb in air citation needed o 3 structure was determined in 1865 the molecule was later proven to have a bent structure and to be diamagnetic in standard conditions ozone is a pale blue gas that condenses at progressively cryogenic temperatures to a dark blue liquid and finally a violet black solid instability with regard to more common dioxygen is such that both concentrated gas and liquid ozone may decompose explosively at elevated temperatures or fast warming to the boiling point 5 it is therefore used commercially only in low concentrations ozone is a powerful oxidant far more so than dioxygen and has many industrial and consumer applications related to oxidation this same high oxidising potential however causes ozone to damage mucous and respiratory tissues in animals and also tissues in plants above concentrations of about this makes ozone a potent respiratory hazard and pollutant near ground level however the ozone layer a portion of the stratosphere with a higher concentration of ozone from two to eight ppm is beneficial preventing damaging ultraviolet light from

external links nomenclature edit the trivial name ozone is the most commonly used and preferred iupac name the systematic names 4 trioxidiene and catena trioxygen valid iupac names are constructed according to the substitutive and additive nomenclatures respectively the name ozone derives from ozein the greek verb for smell referring to distinctive smell in appropriate contexts ozone can be viewed as trioxidane with two hydrogen atoms removed and as such trioxidanylidene may be used as a context specific systematic name according to substitutive nomenclature by default these names pay no regard to the radicality of the ozone molecule in even more specific context this can also name the non radical singlet ground state whereas the diradical state is named trioxidanediyl trioxidanediyl or ozonide is used non systematically to refer to the substituent group ooo care should be taken to avoid confusing the name of the group for the context specific name for ozone given above history edit christian friedrich 18 october 1799 29 august 1868 a prototype ozonometer built by john smyth in 1865 in 1785 the dutch chemist martinus van marum was conducting experiments involving electrical sparking above water when he noticed an unusual smell which he attributed to the electrical reactions failing to realize that he had in fact created ozone 6 a half century later christian friedrich noticed the same pungent odour and recognized it as the smell often following a bolt of lightning in 1839 he succeeded in isolating the gaseous chemical and named it ozone from the greek word ozein meaning to smell 7 8 for this reason is generally credited with the discovery of ozone 6 9 the formula for ozone o 3 was not determined until 1865 by jacques louis soret 10 and confirmed by in 1867 7 11 for much of the second half of the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth ozone was considered a healthy component of the environment by naturalists and health seekers beaumont california had as its official slogan beaumont zone of ozone as evidenced on postcards and chamber of commerce letterhead 12 naturalists working outdoors often considered the higher elevations beneficial because of their ozone content there is quite a different atmosphere at higher elevation with enough ozone to sustain the necessary energy to work wrote naturalist henry henshaw working in hawaii 13 seaside air was considered to be healthy because of its believed ozone content but the smell giving rise to this belief is in fact that of halogenated seaweed metabolites 14 in fact even benjamin franklin believed that the presence of cholera was connected with the deficiency or lack of ozone in the atmosphere a sentiment shared by the british science association then known simply as the british association 15 physical properties edit ozone is colourless or slightly bluish gas blue when liquefied slightly soluble in water and much more soluble in inert non polar solvents such as carbon tetrachloride or fluorocarbons where it forms a blue solution at it condenses to form a dark blue liquid it is dangerous to allow this liquid to warm to its boiling point because both concentrated gaseous ozone and liquid ozone can detonate at temperatures below it forms a violet black solid 16 most people can detect about 0.01 of ozone in air where it has a very specific sharp odour somewhat resembling chlorine bleach exposure of 0.1 to 1 produces headaches burning eyes and irritation to the respiratory passages 17 even low concentrations of ozone in air are very destructive to organic materials such as latex plastics and animal lung tissue ozone is diamagnetic which means that its electrons are all paired in contrast o 2 is paramagnetic containing two unpaired electrons structure edit according to experimental evidence from microwave spectroscopy ozone is a bent molecule with c 2v symmetry similar to the water molecule the o o distances are 127.2 pm 1.272 the o o o angle is 18 the central atom is sp hybridized with one lone pair ozone is a polar molecule with a dipole moment of 0.53 d 19 the molecule can be represented as a resonance hybrid with two contributing structures each with a single bond on one side and double bond on the other the arrangement possesses an overall bond order of 1.5 for both sides reactions edit ozone is among the most powerful oxidizing agents known far stronger than o 2 it is also unstable at high concentrations decaying to ordinary diatomic oxygen it has a varying half life length depending upon atmospheric conditions temperature humidity and air movement in a sealed chamber with a fan that moves the gas ozone has a half life of approximately a day at room temperature 20 some unverified claims imply that ozone can have a half life as short as a half an hour under atmospheric conditions 21 2 o 3 3 o 2 this reaction proceeds more rapidly with increasing temperature and increased pressure deflagration of ozone can be triggered by a spark and can occur in ozone concentrations of 10 wt or higher 22 ozone can also be produced electrochemically at the anode of an electrochemical cell from oxygen this reaction can be used to create smaller quantities of ozone for research purposes o 3 g 2h 2e o 2 g h 2 o 2 075v 23 this reaction can be observed as an unwanted reaction in a hoffman gas apparatus during the electrolysis of water

the workup ozone can also cleave alkynes to form a acid anhydride or diketone product 24 if the reaction is performed in the presence of water the anhydride hydrolyzes to give two carboxylic acids usually ozonolysis is carried out in a solution of dichloromethane at a temperature of o c after a sequence of cleavage and rearrangement an organic ozonide is formed with reductive workup e g zinc in acetic acid or dimethyl sulfide ketones and aldehydes will be formed with oxidative workup e g aqueous or alcoholic hydrogen peroxide carboxylic acids will be formed 25 other substrates edit all three

nh 2 2 co o 3 n 2 co 2 2 h 2 o spectroscopic properties edit ozone is a bent triatomic molecule with three vibrational modes the symmetric stretch bend and antisymmetric stretch 30 the symmetric stretch and bend are weak absorbers but the antisymmetric stretch is strong and responsible for ozone being an important minor greenhouse gas this ir band is also used to detect ambient and atmospheric ozone although uv based measurements are more common 31 the electronic spectrum of ozone is quite complex an overview can be seen at the mpi mainz uv vis spectral atlas of gaseous molecules of atmospheric interest 32 all of the bands are dissociative meaning that the molecule falls apart to o o 2 after absorbing a photon the most important absorption is the hartley band extending from slightly above down to slightly above it is this band that is responsible for absorbing in the stratosphere on the high wavelength side the hartley band transitions to the so called huggins band which falls off rapidly until disappearing by above extending well out into the nir are the chappius and wulf bands there unstructured absorption bands are useful for detecting high ambient concentrations of ozone but are so weak that they do not have much practical effect there are additional absorption bands in the far uv which increase slowly from down to reaching a maximum at ozone in atmosphere edit the distribution of atmospheric ozone in partial pressure as a function of altitude concentration of ozone as measured by the nimbus 7 satellite total ozone concentration in june 2000 as measured by ep toms satellite instrument the standard way to express total ozone levels the amount of ozone in a given vertical column in the atmosphere is by using dobson units point measurements are reported as mole fractions in nmol mol parts per billion ppb or as concentrations in 3 the study of ozone concentration in the atmosphere started in the 1920s 33 ozone layer edit main article ozone layer location and production edit the highest levels of ozone in the atmosphere are in the stratosphere in a region also known as the ozone layer between about and above the surface or between about 6 and 31 miles however even in this layer the ozone concentrations are only two to eight parts per million so most of the oxygen there is dioxygen o 2 at about 210,000 parts per million by volume ozone in the stratosphere is mostly produced from short wave ultraviolet rays between 240 and oxygen starts to absorb weakly at in the herzberg bands but most of the oxygen is dissociated by absorption in the strong bands between 200 and where ozone does not absorb while shorter wavelength light extending to even the x ray limit is energetic enough to dissociate molecular oxygen there is relatively little of it and the strong solar emission at lyman alpha falls at a point where molecular oxygen absorption is a minimum 34 the process of ozone creation and destruction is called the chapman cycle and starts with the photolysis of molecular oxygen o 2 photon radiation 240 nm 2 o followed by reaction of the oxygen atom with another molecule of oxygen to form ozone o o 2 m o 3 m where m denotes the third body that carries off the excess energy of the reaction the ozone molecule can then absorb a uv c photon and dissociate o 3 o o 2 kinetic energy the excess kinetic energy heats the stratosphere when the o atoms and the molecular oxygen fly apart and collide with other molecules this conversion of uv light into kinetic energy warms the stratosphere the oxygen atoms produced in the photolysis of ozone then react back with other oxygen molecule as in the previous step to form more ozone in the clear atmosphere with only nitrogen and oxygen ozone can react with the atomic oxygen to form two molecules of o 2 o 3 o 2 o 2 an estimate of the rate of this termination step to the cycling of atomic oxygen back to ozone can be found simply by taking the ratios of the concentration of o 2 to o 3 the termination reaction is catalysed by the presence of certain free radicals of which the most important are hydroxyl oh nitric oxide no and atomic chlorine cl and bromine br in the second half of the 20th century the amount of ozone in the stratosphere was discovered to be declining mostly because of increasing concentrations of chlorofluorocarbons cfc and similar chlorinated and brominated organic molecules the concern over the health effects of the decline led to the 1987 montreal protocol the ban on the production of many ozone depleting chemicals and in the first and second decade of the 21st century the beginning of the recovery of stratospheric ozone concentrations see also ozone oxygen cycle and ozone depletion importance to surface dwelling life on earth edit levels of ozone at various altitudes and blocking of different bands of ultraviolet radiation essentially all uvc is blocked by dioxygen at or by ozone at in the atmosphere the shorter portion of this band and even more energetic uv causes the formation of the ozone layer when single oxygen atoms produced by uv photolysis of dioxygen below react with more dioxygen the ozone layer itself then blocks most but not quite all sunburn producing uvb the band of uv closest to visible light uva is hardly affected by ozone and most of it reaches the ground ozone in the ozone layer filters out sunlight wavelengths from about uv rays to with ozone peak absorption at about 35 this ozone uv absorption is important to life since it extends the absorption of uv by ordinary oxygen and nitrogen in air which absorb all wavelengths through the lower uv c and the entire uv b band the small unabsorbed part that remains of uv b after passage through ozone causes sunburn in humans and direct dna damage in living tissues in both plants and animals effect on mid range uv b rays is illustrated by its effect on uv b at which has a radiation intensity 350 million times as powerful at the top of the atmosphere as at the surface nevertheless enough of uv b radiation at similar frequency reaches the ground to cause some sunburn and these same wavelengths are also among those responsible for the production of vitamin d in humans the ozone layer has little effect on the longer uv wavelengths called uv a but this radiation does not cause sunburn or direct dna damage and while it probably does cause long term skin damage in certain humans it is not as dangerous to plants and to the health of surface dwelling organisms on earth in general see ultraviolet for more information on near ultraviolet low level ozone edit main articles tropospheric ozone and photochemical smog low level ozone or tropospheric ozone is an atmospheric pollutant 36 it is not emitted directly by car engines or by industrial operations but formed by the reaction of sunlight on air containing hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides that react to form ozone directly at the source of the pollution or many kilometers down wind ozone reacts directly with some hydrocarbons such as aldehydes and thus begins their removal from the air but the products are themselves key components of smog ozone photolysis by uv light leads to production of the hydroxyl radical and this plays a part in the removal of hydrocarbons from the air but is also the first step in the creation of components of smog such as peroxyacyl nitrates which can be powerful eye irritants the atmospheric lifetime of tropospheric ozone is about 22 days its main removal mechanisms are being deposited to the ground the above mentioned reaction giving and by reactions with oh and the peroxy radical ho 2 37 there is evidence of significant reduction in agricultural yields because of increased ground level ozone and pollution which interferes with photosynthesis and stunts overall growth of some plant species 38 39 the united states environmental protection agency is proposing a secondary regulation to reduce crop damage in addition to the primary regulation designed for the protection of human health certain examples of cities with elevated ozone readings are houston texas and mexico city mexico houston has a reading of around 41 nmol mol while mexico city is far more hazardous with a reading of about 125 nmol mol 39 ozone cracking edit ozone cracking in natural rubber tubing ozone gas attacks any polymer possessing olefinic or double bonds within its chain structure such as natural rubber nitrile rubber and styrene butadiene rubber products made using these polymers are especially susceptible to attack which causes cracks to grow longer and deeper with time the rate of crack growth depending on the load carried by the rubber component and the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere such materials can be protected by adding antiozonants such as waxes which bond to the surface to create a protective film or blend with the material and provide long term protection ozone cracking used to be a serious problem in car tires for example but the problem is now seen only in very old tires clarification needed citation needed on the other hand many critical products like gaskets and o rings may be attacked by ozone produced within compressed air systems fuel lines made of reinforced rubber are also susceptible to attack especially within the engine compartment where some ozone is produced by electrical components storing rubber products in close proximity to a dc electric motor can accelerate ozone cracking the commutator of the motor generates sparks which in turn produce ozone ozone as a greenhouse gas edit although ozone was present at ground level before the industrial revolution peak concentrations are now far higher than the pre industrial levels and even background concentrations well away from sources of pollution are substantially higher 40 41 ozone acts as a greenhouse gas absorbing some of the infrared energy emitted by the earth quantifying the greenhouse gas potency of ozone is difficult because it is not present in uniform concentrations across the globe however the most widely accepted scientific assessments relating to climate change e g the intergovernmental panel on climate change third assessment report 42 suggest that the radiative forcing of tropospheric ozone is about 25% that of carbon dioxide the annual global warming potential of tropospheric ozone is between tons carbon dioxide equivalent tons tropospheric ozone this means on a per molecule basis ozone in the troposphere has a radiative forcing effect roughly 1,000 times as strong as carbon dioxide however tropospheric ozone is a short lived greenhouse gas which decays in the atmosphere much more quickly than carbon dioxide this means that over a 20 year span the global warming potential of tropospheric ozone is much less roughly 62 to 69 tons carbon dioxide equivalent ton tropospheric ozone 43 because of its short lived nature tropospheric ozone does not have strong global effects but has very strong radiative forcing effects on regional scales in fact there are regions of the world where tropospheric ozone has a radiative forcing up to 150% of carbon dioxide 44 health effects edit see also environmental impact of the coal industry ozone air pollution edit red alder leaf showing discolouration caused by ozone pollution 45 signboard in gulfton houston indicating an ozone watch ozone precursors are a group of pollutants predominantly those emitted during the combustion of fossil fuels ground level ozone pollution tropospheric ozone is created near the surface by the action of daylight uv rays on these precursors the ozone at ground level is primarily from fossil fuel precursors but methane is a natural precursor and the very low natural background level of ozone at ground level is considered safe this section examines the health impacts of fossil fuel burning which raises ground level ozone far above background levels there is a great deal of evidence to show that ground level ozone can harm lung function and irritate the respiratory system 36 46 exposure to ozone and the pollutants that produce it is linked to premature death asthma bronchitis heart attack and other cardiopulmonary problems 47 48 long term exposure to ozone has been shown to increase risk of death from respiratory illness a study of 450,000 people living in united states cities saw a significant correlation between ozone levels and respiratory illness over the 18 year follow up period the study revealed that people living in cities with high ozone levels such as houston or los angeles had an over 30% increased risk of dying from lung disease 49 50 air quality guidelines such as those from the world health organization the united states environmental protection agency epa and the european union are based on detailed studies designed to identify the levels that can cause measurable ill health effects according to scientists with the us epa susceptible people can be adversely affected by ozone levels as low as 40 nmol mol 48 51 52 in the eu the current target value for ozone concentrations is 3 which is about 60 nmol mol this target applies to all member states in accordance with directive 2008 50 ec 53 ozone concentration is measured as a maximum daily mean of 8 hour averages and the target should not be exceeded on more than 25 calendar days per year starting from january 2010 whilst the directive requires in the future a strict compliance with 3 limit i e mean ozone concentration not to be exceeded on any day of the year there is no date set for this requirement and this is treated as a long term objective 54 in the usa the clean air act directs the epa to set national ambient air quality standards for several pollutants including ground level ozone and counties out of compliance with these standards are required to take steps to reduce their levels in may 2008 under a court order the epa lowered its ozone standard from 80 nmol mol to 75 nmol mol the move proved controversial since the own scientists and advisory board had recommended lowering the standard to 60 nmol mol 48 many public health and environmental groups also supported the 60 nmol mol standard 55 and the world health organization recommends 51 nmol mol on january 7 2010 the u s environmental protection agency epa announced proposed revisions to the national ambient air quality standard naaqs for the pollutant ozone the principal component of smog epa proposes that the level of the 8 hour primary standard which was set at 0.075 in the 2008 final rule should instead be set at a lower level within the range of 0.060 to 0.070 to provide increased protection for children and other populations against an array of o 3 related adverse health effects that range from decreased lung function and increased respiratory symptoms to serious indicators of respiratory morbidity including emergency department visits and hospital admissions for respiratory causes and possibly cardiovascular related morbidity as well as total non accidental and cardiopulmonary mortality 56 on october 26 2015 the epa published a final rule with an effective date of december 28 2015 that revised the 8 hour primary naaqs from 0.075 ppm to 0.070 ppm 57 the epa has developed an air quality index aqi to help explain air pollution levels to the general public under the current standards eight hour average ozone mole fractions of 85 to 104 nmol mol are described as unhealthy for sensitive groups 105 nmol mol to 124 nmol mol as unhealthy and 125 nmol mol to 404 nmol mol as very unhealthy 58 ozone can also be present in indoor air pollution partly as a result of electronic equipment such as photocopiers a connection has also been known to exist between the increased pollen fungal spores and ozone caused by thunderstorms and hospital admissions of asthma sufferers 59 in the victorian era one british folk myth held that the smell of the sea was caused by ozone in fact the characteristic smell of the sea is caused by dimethyl sulfide a chemical generated by phytoplankton victorian british folk considered the resulting smell bracing 60 heat waves edit ozone production rises during heat waves because plants absorb less ozone it is estimated that curtailed ozone absorption by plants was responsible for the loss of 460 lives in the uk in the hot summer of 2006 61 a similar investigation to assess the joint effects of ozone and heat during the european heat waves in 2003 concluded that these appear to be additive 62 physiology edit see also trioxidane ozone along with reactive forms of oxygen such as superoxide singlet oxygen hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorite ions is naturally produced by white blood cells and other biological systems such as the roots of marigolds as a means of destroying foreign bodies ozone reacts directly with organic double bonds also when ozone breaks down to dioxygen it gives rise to oxygen free radicals which are highly reactive and capable of damaging many organic molecules moreover it is believed that the powerful oxidizing properties of ozone may be a contributing factor of inflammation the cause and effect relationship of how the ozone is created in the body and what it does is still under consideration and still subject to various interpretations since other body chemical processes can trigger some of the same reactions a team headed by paul wentworth jr of the department of chemistry at the scripps research institute has shown evidence linking the antibody catalyzed water oxidation pathway of the human immune response to the production of ozone in this system ozone is produced by antibody catalyzed production of trioxidane from water and neutrophil produced singlet oxygen 63 when inhaled ozone reacts with compounds lining the lungs to form specific cholesterol derived metabolites that are thought to facilitate the build up and pathogenesis of atherosclerotic plaques a form of heart disease these metabolites have been confirmed as naturally occurring in human atherosclerotic arteries and are categorized into a class of secosterols termed atheronals generated by ozonolysis of double bond to form a 5,6 secosterol 64 as well as a secondary condensation product via aldolization 65 ozone has been implicated to have an adverse effect on plant growth ozone reduced total chlorophylls carotenoid and carbohydrate concentration and increased 1 aminocyclopropane 1 carboxylic acid acc content and ethylene production in treated plants the ascorbate leaf pool was decreased while lipid peroxidation and solute leakage were significantly higher than in ozone free controls the data indicated that ozone triggered protective mechanisms against oxidative stress in citrus 66 safety regulations edit because of the strongly oxidizing properties of ozone ozone is a primary irritant affecting especially the eyes and respiratory systems and can be hazardous at even low concentrations the canadian centre for occupation safety and health reports that even very low concentrations of ozone can be harmful to the upper respiratory tract and the lungs the severity of injury depends on both by the concentration of ozone and the duration of exposure severe and permanent lung injury or death could result from even a very short term exposure to relatively low concentrations 67 to protect workers potentially exposed to ozone u s occupational safety and health administration has established a permissible exposure limit pel of 0.1 29 cfr 1910.1000 table z 1 calculated as an 8 hour time weighted average higher concentrations are especially hazardous and niosh has established an immediately dangerous to life and health limit idlh of 5 68 work environments where ozone is used or where it is likely to be produced should have adequate ventilation and it is prudent to have a monitor for ozone that will alarm if the concentration exceeds the osha pel continuous monitors for ozone are available from several suppliers elevated ozone exposure can occur on passenger aircraft with levels depending on altitude and atmospheric turbulence 69 united states federal aviation authority regulations set a limit of 250 nmol mol with a maximum four hour average of 100 nmol mol 70 some planes are equipped with ozone converters in the ventilation system to reduce passenger exposure 69 production edit ozone production demonstration fixed nitrogen research laboratory 1926 ozone generators are used to produce ozone for cleaning air or removing smoke odours 71 in unoccupied rooms these ozone generators can produce over 3 g of ozone per hour ozone often forms in nature under conditions where o 2 will not react 17 ozone used in industry is measured in ppm parts per million nmol mol ppb parts per billion 3 mg h milligrams per hour or weight percent the regime of applied concentrations ranges from 1% to 5% in air and from 6% to 14% in oxygen for older generation methods new electrolytic methods can achieve up 20% to 30% dissolved ozone concentrations in output water temperature and humidity play a large role in how much ozone is being produced using traditional generation methods such as corona discharge and ultraviolet light old generation methods will produce less than 50% of nominal capacity if operated with humid ambient air as opposed to very dry air new generators using electrolytic methods can achieve higher purity and dissolution through using water molecules as the source of ozone production corona discharge method edit this is the most common type of ozone generator for most industrial and personal uses while variations of the hot spark coronal discharge method of ozone production exist including medical grade and industrial grade ozone generators these units usually work by means of a corona discharge tube 72 they are typically cost effective and do not require an oxygen source other than the ambient air to produce ozone concentrations of fluctuations in ambient air due to weather or other environmental conditions cause variability in ozone production however they also produce nitrogen oxides as a by product use of an air dryer can reduce or eliminate nitric acid formation by removing water vapor and increase ozone production use of an oxygen concentrator can further increase the ozone production and further reduce the risk of nitric acid formation by removing not only the water vapor but also the bulk of the nitrogen ultraviolet light edit uv ozone generators or vacuum ultraviolet vuv ozone generators employ a light source that generates a narrow band ultraviolet light a subset of that produced by the sun the uv sustains the ozone layer in the stratosphere of earth 73 uv ozone generators use ambient air for ozone production no air prep systems are used air dryer or oxygen concentrator therefore these generators tend to be less expensive however uv ozone generators usually produce ozone with a concentration of about 0.5% or lower which limits the potential ozone production rate another disadvantage of this method is that it requires the ambient air oxygen to be exposed to the uv source for a longer amount of time and any gas that is not exposed to the uv source will not be treated this makes uv generators impractical for use in situations that deal with rapidly moving air or water streams in duct air sterilization for example production of ozone is one of the potential dangers of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation vuv ozone generators are used in swimming pool and spa applications ranging to millions of gallons of water vuv ozone generators unlike corona discharge generators do not produce harmful nitrogen by products and also unlike corona discharge systems vuv ozone generators work extremely well in humid air environments there is also not normally a need for expensive off gas mechanisms and no need for air driers or oxygen concentrators which require extra costs and maintenance cold plasma edit in the cold plasma method pure oxygen gas is exposed to a plasma created by dielectric barrier discharge the diatomic oxygen is split into single atoms which then recombine in triplets to form ozone cold plasma machines utilize pure oxygen as the input source and produce a maximum concentration of about 5% ozone they produce far greater quantities of ozone in a given space of time compared to ultraviolet production however because cold plasma ozone generators are very expensive they are found less frequently than the previous two types the discharges manifest as filamentary transfer of electrons micro discharges in a gap between two electrodes in order to evenly distribute the micro discharges a dielectric insulator must be used to separate the metallic electrodes and to prevent arcing some cold plasma units also have the capability of producing short lived allotropes of oxygen which include o 4 o 5 o 6 o 7 etc these species are even more reactive than ordinary o 3 74 electrolytic edit electrolytic ozone generation eog splits water molecules into h 2 o 2 and o 3 in most eog methods the hydrogen gas will be removed to leave oxygen and ozone as the only reaction products therefore eog can achieve higher dissolution in water without other competing gases found in corona discharge method such as nitrogen gases present in ambient air this method of generation can achieve concentrations of and is independent of air quality because water is used as the source material production of ozone electrolytically is typically unfavorable because of the high overpotential required to produce ozone as compared to oxygen this is why ozone is not produced during typical water electrolysis however it is possible to increase the overpotential of oxygen by careful catalyst selection such that ozone is preferentially produced under electrolysis catalysts typically chosen for this approach are lead dioxide 75 or boron doped diamond 76 special considerations edit ozone cannot be stored and transported like other industrial gases because it quickly decays into diatomic oxygen and must therefore be produced on site available ozone generators vary in the arrangement and design of the high voltage electrodes at production capacities higher than per hour a gas water tube heat exchanger may be utilized as ground electrode and assembled with tubular high voltage electrodes on the gas side the regime of typical gas pressures is around 2 bars 200 kpa absolute in oxygen and 3 bars absolute in air several megawatts of electrical power may be installed in large facilities applied as one phase ac current at 50 to and peak voltages between 3,000 and 20,000 volts applied voltage is usually inversely related to the applied frequency the dominating parameter influencing ozone generation efficiency is the gas temperature which is controlled by cooling water temperature and or gas velocity the cooler the water the better the ozone synthesis the lower the gas velocity the higher the concentration but the lower the net ozone produced at typical industrial conditions almost 90% of the effective power is dissipated as heat and needs to be removed by a sufficient cooling water flow because of the high reactivity of ozone only a few materials may be used like stainless steel quality 316l titanium aluminium as long as no moisture is present glass polytetrafluorethylene or polyvinylidene fluoride viton may be used with the restriction of constant mechanical forces and absence of humidity humidity limitations apply depending on the formulation hypalon may be used with the restriction that no water come in contact with it except for normal atmospheric levels embrittlement or shrinkage is the common mode of failure of elastomers with exposure to ozone ozone cracking is the common mode of failure of elastomer seals like o rings silicone rubbers are usually adequate for use as gaskets in ozone concentrations below 1 wt such as in equipment for accelerated aging of rubber samples incidental production edit ozone may be formed from o 2 by electrical discharges and by action of high energy electromagnetic radiation unsuppressed arcing in electrical contacts motor brushes or mechanical switches breaks down the chemical bonds of the atmospheric oxygen surrounding the contacts o 2 2o free radicals of oxygen in and around the arc recombine to create ozone o 3 77 certain electrical equipment generate significant levels of ozone this is especially true of devices using high voltages such as ionic air purifiers laser printers photocopiers tasers and arc welders electric motors using brushes can generate ozone from repeated sparking inside the unit large motors that use brushes such as those used by elevators or hydraulic pumps will generate more ozone than smaller motors ozone is similarly formed in the catatumbo lightning storms phenomenon on the catatumbo river in venezuela though instability makes it dubious that it has any effect on the ozonosphere 78 it is the largest single natural generator of ozone lending calls for it to be designated a unesco world heritage site 79 laboratory production edit in the laboratory ozone can be produced by electrolysis using a 9 volt battery a pencil graphite rod cathode a platinum wire anode and a 3 molar sulfuric acid electrolyte 80 the half cell reactions taking place are 3 h 2 o o 3 6 h 6 e o v 6 h 6 e 3 h 2 o 0 v 2 h 2 o o 2 4 h 4 e o 1.23 v in the net reaction three equivalents of water are converted into one equivalent of ozone and three equivalents of hydrogen oxygen formation is a competing reaction it can also be generated by a high voltage arc in its simplest form high voltage ac such as the output of a neon sign transformer is connected to two metal rods with the ends placed sufficiently close to each other to allow an arc the resulting arc will convert atmospheric oxygen to ozone it is often desirable to contain the ozone this can be done with an apparatus consisting of two concentric glass tubes sealed together at the top with gas ports at the top and bottom of the outer tube the inner core should have a length of metal foil inserted into it connected to one side of the power source the other side of the power source should be connected to another piece of foil wrapped around the outer tube a source of dry o 2 is applied to the bottom port when high voltage is applied to the foil leads electricity will discharge between the dry dioxygen in the middle and form o 3 and o 2 which will flow out the top port the reaction can be summarized as follows 17 3 o 2 electricity 2 o 3 applications edit industry edit the largest use of ozone is in the preparation of pharmaceuticals synthetic lubricants and many other commercially useful organic compounds where it is used to sever carbon carbon bonds 17 it can also be used for bleaching substances and for killing microorganisms in air and water sources 81 many municipal drinking water systems kill bacteria with ozone instead of the more common chlorine 82 ozone has a very high oxidation potential 83 ozone does not form organochlorine compounds nor does it remain in the water after treatment ozone can form the suspected carcinogen bromate in source water with high bromide concentrations the u s safe drinking water act mandates that these systems introduce an amount of chlorine to maintain a minimum of 0.2 residual free chlorine in the pipes based on results of regular testing where electrical power is abundant ozone is a cost effective method of treating water since it is produced on demand and does not require transportation and storage of hazardous chemicals once it has decayed it leaves no taste or odour in drinking water although low levels of ozone have been advertised to be of some disinfectant use in residential homes the concentration of ozone in dry air required to have a rapid substantial effect on airborne pathogens exceeds safe levels recommended by the u s occupational safety and health administration and environmental protection agency humidity control can vastly improve both the killing power of the ozone and the rate at which it decays back to oxygen more humidity allows more effectiveness spore forms of most pathogens are very tolerant of atmospheric ozone in concentrations where asthma patients start to have issues industrially ozone is used to disinfect laundry in hospitals food factories care homes etc 84 disinfect water in place of chlorine 17 deodorize air and objects such as after a fire this process is extensively used in fabric restoration kill bacteria on food or on contact surfaces 85 sanitize swimming pools and spas kill insects in stored grain 86 scrub yeast and mold spores from the air in food processing plants wash fresh fruits and vegetables to kill yeast mold and bacteria 85 chemically attack contaminants in water iron arsenic hydrogen sulfide nitrites and complex organics lumped together as colour provide an aid to flocculation agglomeration of molecules which aids in filtration where the iron and arsenic are removed manufacture chemical compounds via chemical synthesis 87 clean and bleach fabrics the former use is utilized in fabric restoration the latter use is patented citation needed act as an antichlor in chlorine based bleaching assist in processing plastics to allow adhesion of inks age rubber samples to determine the useful life of a batch of rubber eradicate water borne parasites such as giardia lamblia and cryptosporidium in surface water treatment plants ozone is a reagent in many organic reactions in the laboratory and in industry ozonolysis is the cleavage of an alkene to carbonyl compounds many hospitals around the world use large ozone generators to decontaminate operating rooms between surgeries the rooms are cleaned and then sealed airtight before being filled with ozone which effectively kills or neutralizes all remaining bacteria 88 ozone is used as an alternative to chlorine or chlorine dioxide in the bleaching of wood pulp 89 it is often used in conjunction with oxygen and hydrogen peroxide to eliminate the need for chlorine containing compounds in the manufacture of high quality white paper 90 ozone can be used to detoxify cyanide wastes for example from gold and silver mining by oxidising cyanide to cyanate and eventually to carbon dioxide 91 consumers edit see also air purifier ozone hazards devices generating high levels of ozone some of which use ionization are used to sanitize and deodorize uninhabited buildings rooms ductwork woodsheds boats and other vehicles in the u s air purifiers emitting low levels of ozone have been sold this kind of air purifier is sometimes claimed to imitate way of purifying the air without filters and to sanitize both it and household surfaces the united states environmental protection agency epa has declared that there is evidence to show that at concentrations that do not exceed public health standards ozone is not effective at removing many odor causing chemicals or viruses bacteria mold or other biological pollutants furthermore its report states that results of some controlled studies show that concentrations of ozone considerably higher than these human safety standards are possible even when a user follows the operating instructions 92 ozonated water is used to launder clothes and to sanitize food drinking water and surfaces in the home according to the u s food and drug administration fda it is amending the food additive regulations to provide for the safe use of ozone in gaseous and aqueous phases as an antimicrobial agent on food including meat and poultry studies at california polytechnic university demonstrated that 0.3 levels of ozone dissolved in filtered tapwater can produce a reduction of more than 99.99% in such food borne microorganisms as salmonella e coli 0157 h7 and campylobacter this quantity is 20,000 times the who recommended limits stated above 85 93 ozone can be used to remove pesticide residues from fruits and vegetables 94 95 ozone is used in homes and hot tubs to kill bacteria in the water and to reduce the amount of chlorine or bromine required by reactivating them to their free state since ozone does not remain in the water long enough ozone by itself is ineffective at preventing cross contamination among bathers and must be used in conjunction with halogens gaseous ozone created by ultraviolet light or by corona discharge is injected into the water 96 ozone is also widely used in treatment of water in aquariums and fish ponds its use can minimize bacterial growth control parasites eliminate transmission of some diseases and reduce or eliminate yellowing of the water ozone must not come in contact with gill structures natural salt water with life forms provides enough instantaneous demand that controlled amounts of ozone activate bromide ion to hypobromous acid and the ozone entirely decays in a few seconds to minutes if oxygen fed ozone is used the water will be higher in dissolved oxygen gill structures will atrophy and they will become dependent on higher dissolved oxygen levels aquaculture edit ozonation a process of infusing water with ozone can be used in aquaculture to facilitate organic breakdown ozone is also added to recirculating systems to reduce nitrite levels 97 through conversion into nitrate if nitrite levels in the water are high nitrites will also accumulate in the blood and tissues of fish where it interferes with oxygen transport it causes oxidation of the heme group of haemoglobin from ferrous fe 2+ to ferric fe 3+ making haemoglobin unable to bind o 2 98 despite these apparent positive effects ozone use in recirculation systems has been linked to reducing the level of bioavailable iodine in salt water systems resulting in iodine deficiency symptoms such as goitre and decreased growth in senegalese sole solea senegalensis larvae 99 ozonate seawater is used for surface disinfection of haddock and atlantic halibut eggs against nodavirus nodavirus is a lethal and vertically transmitted virus which causes severe mortality in fish haddock eggs should not be treated with high ozone level as eggs so treated did not hatch and died after days 100 agriculture edit ozone application on freshly cut pineapple and banana shows increase in flavonoids and total phenol contents when exposure is up to 20 minutes decrease in ascorbic acid one form of vitamin c content is observed but the positive effect on total phenol content and flavonoids can overcome the negative effect 101 tomatoes upon treatment with ozone shows an increase in lutein and lycopene 102 however ozone application on strawberries in pre harvest period shows decrease in ascorbic acid content 103 ozone facilitates the extraction of some heavy metals from soil using edta edta forms strong water soluble coordination compounds with some heavy metals pb zn thereby making it possible to dissolve them out from contaminated soil if contaminated soil is pre
