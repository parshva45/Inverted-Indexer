topological diagram of the whole system including extension under construction and the approved maryland purple line light rail which will be operationally separate from metro the washington metro known colloquially as metro and branded metrorail 4 is the heavy rail rapid transit system serving the washington metropolitan area in the united states it is administered by the washington metropolitan area transit authority wmata which also operates metrobus service under the metro name 5 besides the district of columbia metro serves several jurisdictions in the states of maryland and virginia in maryland metro provides service to montgomery and prince counties in virginia to arlington and fairfax counties and the independent city of alexandria combined with its ridership in the independent virginia cities of falls church and fairfax the metro service area is largely coextensive with the inner ring of the washington metropolitan area the system is currently being expanded to reach dulles international airport and loudoun county virginia it operates mostly as a subway in the district itself while most of the suburban tracks are at surface level or elevated opened in 1976 the network now includes six lines 91 stations and 117 miles of route 6 7 due to subway track depths wheaton station has the longest single tier escalator in the western hemisphere spanning 230 feet 8

1989 during the 1960s plans were laid for a massive freeway system in washington harland bartholomew who chaired the national capital planning commission thought that a rail transit system would never be self sufficient because of low density land uses and general transit ridership decline 11 but the plan met fierce opposition and was altered to include a capital beltway system plus rail line radials the beltway received full funding funding for the ambitious inner loop freeway system was partially reallocated toward construction of the metro system 12 in 1960 the federal government created the national capital transportation agency to develop a rapid rail system in 1966 a bill creating wmata was passed by the federal government the district of columbia virginia and maryland 6 with planning power for the system being transferred to it from the ncta 13 interior of a rehabilitated breda car wmata approved plans for a 98 mile regional system in 1968 13 construction began after a groundbreaking ceremony on december 9 1969 when secretary of transportation john a volpe district mayor walter washington and maryland governor marvin mandel tossed the first spade of dirt at judiciary square 14 the first portion of the system opened march 27 1976 with 4.6 miles available on the red line with five stations from rhode island avenue to farragut north all in the district of columbia 15 arlington county virginia was linked to the system on july 1 1977 16 montgomery county maryland on february 6 1978 17 prince county maryland on november 20 1978 18 and fairfax county virginia and alexandria virginia on december 17 1983 6 19 underground stations were built with cathedral like arches of concrete highlighted by soft indirect lighting 20 the name metro was suggested by massimo vignelli who designed the subway maps for the new york city subway 21 the 103 mile 83 station system was completed with the opening of the green line segment to branch avenue on january 13 2001 this did not mean the end of the growth of the system a 3 22 mile extension of the blue line to largo town center and morgan boulevard opened on december 18 2004 the first in fill station gallaudet university at the time called the new york university station on the red line between union station and rhode island ave brentwood opened november 20 2004 construction began in march 2009 for an extension to dulles airport to be built in two phases 22 the first phase five stations connecting east falls church to tysons corner and wiehle avenue in reston opened on july 26 2014 23 metro construction required billions of federal dollars originally provided by congress under the authority of the national capital transportation act of 1969 public law 91-143 the cost was paid with 67% federal money and 33% local money this act was amended on january 3 1980 by public law 96-184 the national capital transportation amendment of 1979 also known as the stark harris act which authorized additional funding of $1.7 billion to permit the completion of 89.5 miles of the system as provided under the terms of a full funding grant agreement executed with wmata in july 1986 which required 20% to be paid from local funds on november 15 1990 public law 101-551 the national capital transportation amendments of 1990 authorized an additional $1.3 billion in federal funds for construction of the remaining 13.5 miles of the 103 mile system completed via the execution of full funding grant agreements with a 63% federal 37 local matching 24 the highest ridership for a single day was on the day of the inauguration of barack obama january 20 2009 with 1,120,000 riders it broke the previous record set the day before of 866,681 riders 25 june 2008 set several ridership records the single month ridership record of 19,729,641 total riders the record for highest average weekday ridership with 1,044,400 weekday trips had five of the ten highest ridership days and had 12 weekdays in which ridership exceed 800,000 trips 10 in february 2006 metro officials chose randi miller a car dealership employee from woodbridge virginia to record new doors opening doors closing and please stand

chicago architect harry weese and are examples of late 20th century modern architecture with their heavy use of exposed concrete and repetitive design motifs metro stations display aspects of brutalist design the stations also reflect the influence of neoclassical architecture in their overarching coffered ceiling vaults weese worked with cambridge massachusetts based lighting designer bill lam on the indirect lighting used throughout the system 30 31 all of original brutalist stations are found in downtown washington d c and neighboring urban corridors of arlington virginia while newer stations incorporate simplified cost efficient designs 32 in 2007 the design of the vaulted ceiling stations was voted number 106 on the favorite architecture list compiled by the american institute of architects aia and was the only brutalist design to win a place among the 150 selected by this public survey in january 2014 the aia announced that it would present its twenty five year award to the washington metro system for an architectural design of enduring significance that has stood the test of time by embodying architectural excellence for 25 to 35 years the announcement cited the key role of weese who conceived and implemented a common design kit of parts which continues to guide the construction of new metro stations over a quarter century later albeit with designs modified slightly for cost reasons 33 intersection of coffered concrete ceiling vaults at metro center opened 1976 a major transfer station a train departs from mcpherson square station opened 1977 which has an original ceiling vault design canopy over entrance to plaza opened 1977 echoes the arched ceiling underground woodley park station opened 1981 shows a modified ceiling vault shady grove opened 1984 is a typical original above ground station spring hill opened 2014 is a typical newer above ground station system edit map of system drawn to scale this map does not include the silver line since opening in 1976 the metro network has grown to include six lines 91 stations and 118 miles of route 34 the rail network is designed according to a spoke hub distribution paradigm with rail lines running between downtown washington and its nearby suburbs the system makes extensive use of running more than one service on the same track there are six operating lines 34 the official map was designed by noted graphic designer lance wyman 35 and bill cannan while they were partners in the design firm of wyman cannan in new york city 36 about 50 miles of track is underground as are 47 of the 91 stations track runs underground mostly within the district and high density suburbs surface track accounts for about 46 miles of the total and aerial track makes up 9 miles 34 the system operates on a unique track gauge of 8 1 4 in this is 1/4 of an inch narrower than 8 1 2 in standard gauge why in an effort to gain revenues wmata has started to allow retail ventures in metro stations wmata has authorized dvd rental vending machines and ticket booths for the old town trolley tours and is seeking additional retail tenants 37 washington metro lines line name opened stations distance

ashburn opens 2020 largo town center financing edit metro relies extensively on passenger fares and appropriated financing from the maryland virginia and washington d c governments which are represented on board of directors the system does not have a dedicated revenue stream as other cities mass transit systems do critics allege that this has contributed to recent history of maintenance and safety problems 38 for fiscal year 2015 the estimated farebox recovery ratio fare revenue divided by operating expenses was 66 percent based on the wmata approved budget 39 infrastructure edit stations edit main article list of washington metro stations there are 40 stations in the district of columbia 15 in prince county 11 in montgomery county 11 in arlington county 11 in fairfax county and three in the city of alexandria 34 the second phase of the silver line will add 6 new more in fairfax county and three in loudoun county virginia 2019 or 2020 40 at 196 feet below the surface the forest glen station on the red line is the deepest in the system there are no escalators high speed elevators take 20 seconds to travel from the street to the station platform the wheaton station one stop to the north of the forest glen station has the longest continuous escalator in the usa and in the western hemisphere at 230 feet 34 41 the rosslyn station is the deepest station on the orange blue line at 117 feet below street level the station features the second longest continuous escalator in the metro system at 194 feet an escalator ride between the street level and the mezzanine level takes nearly two minutes 42 the system is not centered on any single station but metro center is at the intersection of the red orange blue and silver lines 43 the station is also the location of main sales office metro has designated five other core stations that have high passenger volume including 44 gallery place transfer station for the red green and yellow lines plaza transfer station for the orange blue silver green and yellow lines union station the busiest station by passenger boardings 43 farragut north and farragut west in order to deal with the high number of passengers in transfer stations metro is studying the possibility of building pedestrian connections between nearby core transfer stations for example a 750 foot passage between metro center and gallery place stations would allow passengers to transfer between the orange blue silver and yellow green lines without going one stop on the red line another tunnel between farragut west and farragut north stations would allow transfers between the red and orange blue silver lines decreasing transfer demand at metro center by an estimated 11 44 the farragut pedestrian tunnel has yet to be physically implemented but was added in virtual form effective october 28 2011 the smartrip system now interprets an exit from one farragut station and entrance to the other as part of a single trip allowing card holders to transfer on foot without having to pay a second full fare 45 rolling stock edit main article washington metro rolling stock train of rohr cars arriving at the cheverly station fleet consists of 1,126 rail cars each 75 feet long 46 trains have a maximum speed of and average including stops operating rules presently limit their top speed to 34 all cars operate as married pairs consecutively numbered even odd with a cab at each end of the pair except 7000 series railcars with systems shared across the pair 47 metro currently operates 850 cars during rush hours there are 814 cars in active service four cars have been permanently removed from revenue service for use as the money train and the remaining 36 cars compose gap trains to serve as backup should a train experience problems 48 series

ansaldobreda manufactured the second order of 76 cars delivered in 1983 and 1984 these cars numbered were rehabilitated in the early 2000s by alstom in hornell new york a third order of 288 cars also from breda were delivered between 1984 and 1988 these cars are numbered and were rehabilitated by alstom in the early 2000s an order of 100 cars from breda numbered were delivered between 1992 and 1994 a fifth order of 192 cars was manufactured by construcciones y auxiliar de ferrocarriles caf of spain these cars are numbered and were delivered from 2001 through 2004 a sixth order of 184 cars from alstom transportation are numbered 6000-6183 and were delivered between 2005 and 2007 the cars have body shells built in barcelona spain with assembly completed in hornell new york 51 the 7000 series of cars currently being built by kawasaki heavy industries rolling stock company of kobe japan are being delivered for on site testing during winter 2013 and first entered service april 14 2015 on the blue line the new cars are different from previous models in that while still operating as married pairs the cab in one car was eliminated turning it into a b car the new design allows for increased passenger capacity elimination of redundant equipment greater energy efficiency and lower maintenance costs the national transportation safety board investigation of the fatal june 22 2009 accident led it to conclude that the 1000 series cars are unsafe and unable to protect passengers in a crash as a result on july 26 2010 metro voted to purchase 300 7000 series cars to replace the remaining 1000 series cars 52 53 an additional 128 7000 series cars were also ordered to serve the new silver line to dulles airport 64 for each phase in may 2013 metro placed another order for 100 7000 series cars which will replace all of the 4000 series cars 54 on july 13 2015 wmata used their final option and purchased an additional 220 7000 series railcars for fleet expansion bringing the total number of 7000 series railcars on order to 748 55 signaling and operation edit main article washington metro signaling and operation during normal passenger operation on revenue tracks trains are designed to be controlled by an integrated automatic train operation ato and automatic train control atc system that accelerates and brakes trains automatically without operator intervention all trains are still manned with train operators who open and close the doors make station announcements and supervise their trains the system was designed so that an operator could manually operate a train when necessary 56 since june 2009 when two red line trains collided and killed nine people due in part to malfunctions in the atc system all metro trains have been manually operated 57 the current state of manual operation has led to heavily degraded service with new manual requirements such as absolute blocks speed restrictions and end of platform stopping leading to increased headways between trains increased dwell time and worse on time performance 58 metro originally planned to have all trains be automated again by 2017 59 but those plans were shelved in early 2017 in order to focus on more pressing safety and infrastructure issues 60 the train doors were originally designed to be opened and closed automatically and the doors would re open if an object blocked them much as elevator doors do almost immediately after the system opened in 1976 metro realized these features were not conducive to safe or efficient operation and they were disabled at present the doors may be opened automatically or manually if a door tries to close and it meets an obstruction the operator must re open the door hours and headways edit metrorail begins service at 5 am monday through friday 7 am on saturdays and 8 am sundays it ends service at 11 30 pm monday through thursday 1 00 am friday and saturday and 11 00 pm on sundays although the last trains leave the end stations inbound about half an hour before these times 61 not in citation given trains run more frequently during rush hours on all lines with scheduled peak hour headways of 4 minutes on the red line and 9 minutes on all other lines headways are much longer during midday and evening on weekdays and all weekend the midday six minute headways are based on a combination of two metrorail lines orange blue and yellow green as each route can run every 12 minutes in the case of the red line every other train bound for glenmont terminates at silver spring instead night and weekend service varies between 8 and 24 minutes with trains generally scheduled only every 20 minutes other service truncations also occur in the system during rush hour service only on the red line every other train bound for shady grove terminates at grosvenor strathmore in addition to the alternating terminations at silver spring mentioned above for the yellow line all trains bound for fort totten terminate at mount vernon square these are primarily instituted due to a limited supply of rail cars and the locations of pocket tracks throughout the system until 1999 metro ended service at midnight every night and weekend service began at 8 am that year wmata began late night service on fridays and saturdays until 1 am by 2007 with encouragement from businesses that closing time had been pushed back to 3 am 62 with peak fares in effect for entries after midnight there were plans floated to end late night service due to costs in 2011 but they were met with resistance by riders 63 wmata temporarily discontinued late night rail service on may 30 2016 so that metro can conduct an extensive track rehabilitation program in an effort to improve the reliability 64 65 on june 25 2017 metro changed its hours of operation with closing at 11 30 pm 1 am on friday and saturday and 11 pm on sunday 66 67 with the last trains leaving the end stations inbound about half an hour before these times 68 special service patterns edit metro runs special service patterns on holidays and when events in washington may require additional service independence day activities require metro to adjust service to provide extra capacity to and from the national mall 69 wmata makes similar adjustments during other events such as presidential inaugurations metro has altered service and used some stations as entrances or exits only to help manage congestion 70 rush plus edit in 2012 wmata announced enhanced rush period service that was implemented on june 18 2012 under the name or rush plus service occurred only during portions of peak service am and pm monday through friday the rush realignment was intended to free up space in the rosslyn portal the tunnel between rosslyn and foggy bottom which operates at full capacity already when silver line service began those trains would be routed through the tunnel and so some of what were blue line trains to largo town center were now diverted across the fenwick bridge to become yellow line trains running all the way up the green line to greenbelt select yellow line trains running south diverted along the blue line to franconia springfield as opposed to the normal yellow line terminus at huntington until the start of silver line service excess rosslyn tunnel capacity was used by additional orange line trains that traveled along the blue line to largo as opposed to the normal orange line terminus at new carrollton rush had the additional effect of giving some further number of passengers transfer free journeys though severely increasing headways for the portion of the blue line running between pentagon and rosslyn in may 2017 metro announced that yellow rush service would be eliminated effective june 25 2017 71 passenger information systems edit pids signs at the gallery place station a passenger information display system pids was installed in all metrorail stations in 2000 displays are located on all track platforms and at the mezzanine entrances of stations and provide real time information on next train arrivals delayed trains emergency announcements and related information 72 wmata also provides current train and related information to customers with conventional web browsers as well as users of smartphones and other mobile devices 73 in 2010 metro began sharing its pids data with outside software developers for use in creating additional real time applications for mobile devices free apps are available to the public on major mobile device software platforms ios android windows phone palm 74 75 wmata also began providing real time train information by phone in 2010 76 fare structure edit see also smartrip standard self service vending machines for passes and farecards located at each station riders enter and exit the system using a stored value card in the form of a proximity card known as smartrip the fare is deducted from the balance of the card when exiting 77 smartrip cards can be purchased at station vending machines online or at retail outlets and can store up to $300 in value metro fares vary based on the distance traveled and the time of day at entry during peak hours weekdays from opening until and fares effective 2014 range from $2.25 to $6.00, depending on distance traveled at all other times fares range from $2.00 to $3.85 based on distance traveled discounted fares are available for school children the disabled and the elderly 78 metro charges reduced fares on all federal holidays 79 not in citation given since june 25 2017 the first fare hike in three years peak period rail fares increased 10 cents with $2.25 as the new minimum and $6 as the maximum one way fare off peak fares rose 25 cents to $2 minimum $3.85 maximum as will bus fares 80 81 82 67 a new one day unlimited rail bus pass will be available for $14.75. 67 passengers may purchase passes at farecard vending machines passes are loaded onto the same smartrip cards as stored value but grant riders unlimited travel

during peak fare times and any trip during off peak hours if the trip costs more than $3.60 the difference is deducted from the cash balance of a smartrip card possibly after the necessary value is added at the exitfare machine a non negative stored value is required to enter the metrorail system 85 a 7 day fast pass for $60.00, valid for seven consecutive days of unlimited metrorail travel 86 a 28 day metrorail fast pass for $237. this is for convenience only offering no savings over four uses of the 7 day fast pass in addition metro sells selectpass available for purchase online only by registered smartrip cardholders valid for trips up to a specified value for a specific calendar month with the balance being deducted from the cash value similarly to the short trip pass 87 the pass

of july will be increased to reflect the june 25 fare changes users can add value to any farecard riders pay an exit fare based on time of day and distance traveled trips may include segments on multiple lines under one fare as long as the rider does not exit the faregates with the exception of the farragut crossing out of station interchange between farragut west and farragut north stations at farragut crossing riders may exit from one station and reenter at the other within 30 minutes on a single fare when making a trip that uses metrobus and metrorail a discount is available when using a smartrip card 90 91 when entering and exiting at the same station users are normally charged a minimum fare 2.15 1 75 however since july 1 2016 users have had a 15 minute grace period to exit the station those who do so will receive a rebate of the amount paid as an autoload to their smartrip card 92 93 students at district of columbia public schools ride both metrobus and metrorail for free 94 fare history edit front face of an old paper metro farecard listing declining balance value remaining the contract for fare collection system was awarded in 1975 to cubic transportation systems 95 electronic fare collection using paper magnetic stripe cards started on july 1 1977 a little more than a year after the first stations opened prior to electronic fare collection exact change fareboxes were used 96 historic paper farecard system is also shared by bay area rapid transit which cubic won a contract for in 1974 95 any remaining value stored on the paper cards was printed on the card at each exit and passes were printed with the expiration date several adjustments were made to shift the availability of passes from paper tickets to smartrip cards in 2012 and 2013 in may 2014 metro announced plans to retrofit more than 500 fare vending machines throughout the system to dispense smartrip cards rather than paper fare cards and eventually eliminate magnetic fare cards entirely 97 this was completed in early december 2015 when the last paper farecard was sold 98 the faregates stopped accepting paper farecards on march 6 2016 99 100 and the last day for trading in farecards to transfer the value to smartrip was june 30 2016 100 safety and security edit security edit main article metro transit police department metro transit police cruiser metro planners designed the system

station environments were designed with crime prevention in mind 101 has contributed to metro being among the safest and cleanest subway systems in the united states 102 there are nearly 6,000 video surveillance cameras used across the system to enhance security 103 metro is patrolled by its own police force which is charged with ensuring the safety of passengers and employees transit police officers patrol the metro system and metrobuses and they have jurisdiction and arrest powers throughout the 1 500 square mile 2 metro service area for crimes that occur on or against transit authority facilities or within 150 feet of a metrobus stop the metro transit police department is one of two u s police agencies that has local police authority in three state level jurisdictions maryland virginia and the district of columbia the u s park police being the other 104 each city and county in the metro service area has similar ordinances that regulate or prohibit vending on metro owned property and which prohibit riders from eating drinking or smoking in metro trains buses and stations the transit police have a reputation for enforcing these laws rigorously one widely publicized incident occurred in october 2000 when police arrested 12 year old ansche hedgepeth for eating french fries in the tenleytown au station 105 in a 2004 opinion by john roberts now chief justice of the united states the d c circuit court of appeals upheld arrest 106 by then wmata had answered negative publicity by adopting a policy of first issuing warnings to juveniles and arresting them only after three violations within a year zero tolerance policy on food trash and other sources of disorder embodies the broken windows philosophy of crime reduction this philosophy also extends to the use of station restroom facilities a longstanding policy intended to curb unlawful and unwanted activity has been to only allow employees to use metro restrooms 102 station managers may make exceptions for passengers with small children the elderly or the disabled 107 metro now allows the use of restrooms by passengers who gain a station permission except during periods of heightened terror alerts 108 random bag searches edit on october 27 2008 the metro transit police department announced plans to immediately begin random searches of backpacks purses and other bags transit police would search riders at random before boarding a bus or entering a station it also explained its intent to stop anyone acting suspiciously 109 metro claims that the united states court of appeals for the second circuit decision in macwade v kelly 110 which upheld random searches on the new york city subway allows metro transit police to take similar action 111 metro transit police chief michael taborn stated that if someone were to turn around and simply enter the system through another escalator or elevator metro has a plan to address suspicious behavior 112 security expert bruce schneier characterized the plan as security theater against a movie plot threat and does not believe random bag searches actually improve security 113 the metro riders advisory council recommended to board of directors that metro hold at least one public meeting regarding the search program as of december 2008 update metro had not conducted a single bag search 114 in 2010 metro once again announced that it would implement random bag searches and conducted the first such searches on december 21 2010 115 the searches consist of swabbing bags and packages for explosive residue and x raying or opening any packages which turned up positive on the first day of searches at least one false positive for explosives was produced which metro officials indicated could occur for a variety of reasons including if a passenger had recently been in contact with firearms or been to a firing range 116 the d c bill of rights coalition and the montgomery county civil rights coalition circulated a petition against random bag searches taking the position that the practice violates the fourth amendment to the united states constitution and would not improve security 117 on january 3 2011 metro held a public forum for the searches at a metro riders advisory council meeting at which more than 50 riders spoke out most of them in opposition to the searches however at the meeting metro officials called random bag inspections a success and claimed that few riders had complained 118 after a prolonged absence as of february 2017 update bag searches have resumed at random stations throughout the washington metro

when a train failed to stop at the shady grove station the four car train overran the station platform and struck an unoccupied train that was awaiting assignment the national transportation safety board ntsb investigation found that the crash was a result of a failure in the computer controlled braking system the ntsb recommended that metro grant train operators the ability to manually control the braking system even in inclement weather and recommended that metro prohibit parked rail cars on tracks used by incoming outbound trains 121 on november 3 2004 an out of service red line train rolled backwards into the woodley park station hitting an in service train stopped at the platform the rear car 1077 was telescoped by the first car of the standing train 4018 no one was killed but 20

estimated 345 passengers were evacuated from the damaged train by and the ntsb arrived on the scene by noon two minor injuries were reported and a third passenger was taken to george washington university hospital 134 the ntsb ruled the crash was due to the train failure to follow standard procedures and wmata management for failure to provide proper supervision of the train operator which resulted in the incomplete configuration of the train identification and destination codes leading to the routing of the train into the pocket track 135 on april 24 2012 around 7 15 pm a blue line train bound for derailed near rosslyn no injuries were reported 136 on july 6 2012 around 4 45 pm a green line train bound for downtown washington d c and branch avenue derailed near west hyattsville

reroute trains to alleviate congestion at the busiest stations 144 population growth in the region has also revived efforts to extend service build new stations and construct additional lines silver line edit the new tysons corner station under construction next to virginia state route 123 in july 2012 main article silver line washington metro the most prominent expansion is the dulles corridor metrorail project dubbed the silver line a 23 mile extension from the orange line into loudoun county virginia by way of tysons corner and washington dulles international airport rail to dulles has been discussed since the system opened in 1976 the current silver line project was formally proposed in 2002 and initially approved by the federal transit administration in 2004 145 after several delays federal funding for phase 1 was secured in december 2008 146 and construction began in march 2009 147 the line is being constructed in two phases the first phase to wiehle reston east in reston virginia opened july 26 2014 148 and the second phase to ashburn beyond dulles airport is projected for completion in 2019 or 2020 149 blue line realignment edit blue line trains share a single tunnel with orange line and silver line trains to cross the potomac river the current tunnel limits service in each direction creating a choke point a 2001 proposal would have rerouted the blue line between the rosslyn and stations by building a bridge or tunnel from virginia to a new station in georgetown 150 the proposal was later rejected due to cost 151 but metro again started considering a similar scenario in 2011 152 orange line extension edit the virginia department of transportation vdot announced on january 18 2008 that it and the virginia department of rail and public transportation drpt had begun work on a draft environmental impact statement eis for the i 66 corridor in fairfax and prince william counties according to vdot the eis officially named the i 66 multimodal transportation and environment study would focus on improving mobility along i 66 from the capital beltway i 495 interchange in fairfax county to the interchange with u s route 15 in prince william county the eis also allegedly includes a four station extension of the orange line past vienna the extension would continue to run in the i 66 median and would have stations at chain bridge road fair oaks stringfellow road and centreville near virginia route 28 and u s route 29 153 in its final report published june 8 2012 the study and analysis revealed that an extension would have a minimal impact on metrorail ridership and volumes on study area roadways inside the beltway and would therefore not relieve congestion in the study corridor 154 fort belvoir and fort meade extensions edit in 2005 the defense department announced that it would be shifting 18,000 jobs to fort belvoir in virginia and at least 5,000 jobs to fort meade in maryland by 2012 as part of that base realignment and closure plan in anticipation of such a move local officials and the military proposed extending the blue and green lines to service each base the proposed extension of the green line could cost $100 million per mile 60 million per kilometer and a light rail extension to fort belvoir was estimated to cost up to $800 million neither proposal has established timelines for planning or construction 155 156 potomac yard station edit see also potomac yard station in 2008 officials began to explore the possibility of adding an infill station called potomac yard in the potomac yard area of alexandria on the

which would pass through the district and silver spring an extension of the green line to national harbor in maryland and re routing the blue line in the district between the orange line and green line none of these lines are yet funded for planning or construction 152 related non wmata projects edit proposed route of the purple line a number of light rail and urban streetcar projects have been proposed to extend or supplement service provided by metro like the silver line in virginia the proposed purple line has been in planning since the 1980s 158 the project was originally envisioned as a circular heavy rail line connecting the outer stations on each branch of the metrorail system in a pattern roughly mirroring the capital beltway 159 the current proposal would create a light rail system in maryland between the bethesda and new carrollton stations by way of silver spring and college park such a plan would connect both branches of the red line to the green and orange lines and would decrease the travel time between suburban metro stations 158 160 the corridor cities transitway cct is a proposed 15 mile bus rapid transit line that would link clarksburg maryland in northern montgomery county with the shady grove station on the red line 161 assuming that the anticipated federal state and local government funds are provided construction of the first 9 miles of the system
