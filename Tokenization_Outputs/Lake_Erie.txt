erie 5 i french lac is the fourth largest lake by surface area of the five great lakes in north america and the eleventh largest globally if measured in terms of surface area 1 6 it is the southernmost shallowest and smallest by volume of the great lakes 7 8 and therefore also has the shortest average water residence time at its deepest point lake erie is 210 feet 64 metres deep situated on the international boundary between canada and the united states lake northern shore is the canadian province of ontario with the u s states of michigan ohio pennsylvania and new york on its western southern and eastern shores these jurisdictions divide the surface area of the lake with water boundaries the lake was named by the erie people a native americans people who lived along its southern shore the tribal name erie is a shortened form of the iroquoian word erielhonan meaning long tail 9 situated below lake huron primary inlet is the detroit river the main natural outflow from the lake is via the niagara river which provides hydroelectric power to canada and the u s as it spins huge turbines near niagara falls at lewiston new york and queenston ontario 10 some outflow occurs via the welland canal part of the st lawrence seaway which diverts water for ship passages from port colborne ontario on lake erie to st catharines on lake ontario an elevation difference of

with a length of 241 statute miles 388 km 209 nmi 2 and breadth of 57 statute miles 2 at its widest points it is the shallowest of the great lakes with an average depth of 10 fathoms 3 feet 2 and a maximum depth of 35 fathoms 2 3 for comparison lake superior has an average depth of 80 fathoms 3 feet a volume of 2,900 cubic miles 3 and shoreline of 2,726 statute miles because it is the shallowest it is also the warmest of the great lakes 14 and in 1999 this almost became a problem for two nuclear power plants which require cool lake water to keep their reactors cool 15 the warm summer of 1999 caused lake temperatures to come close to the limit necessary to keep the plants cool 15 also because of its shallowness and in spite of being the warmest lake in the summer it is also the first to freeze in the winter 16 the shallowest section of lake erie is the western basin where depths average only 25 to 30 feet 7.6 to as a result the slightest breeze can kick up lively waves according to a new york times reporter in 2004 17 the waves build very quickly according to other accounts 18 19 sometimes fierce waves springing up unexpectedly have led to dramatic rescues in one instance a cleveland resident trying to measure the dock near his house became trapped but was rescued by a fire department diver from avon lake ohio in a tug of war against the waves the two were finally hauled out by rope after being trapped for an hour and a half baker was back on dry land exhausted and battered but alive tatiana morales cbs news 2004 20 the niagara river empties lake erie into lake ontario this water has just passed over niagara falls this area is also known as the thunderstorm capital of canada with breathtaking lightning displays 19 lake erie is primarily fed by the detroit river from lake huron and lake st clair and drains via the niagara river and niagara falls into lake ontario navigation downstream is provided by the welland canal part of the saint lawrence seaway other major contributors to lake erie include the grand river the huron river the maumee river the sandusky river the buffalo river and the cuyahoga river the drainage basin covers 30,140 square miles 2 point pelee national park the southernmost point of the canadian mainland is located on a peninsula extending into the lake several islands are found in the western end of the lake these belong to

tribune as having charms that were more subtle than put in bay and offers amenities such as beach lounging hiking biking and marveling at deep glacial grooves left in limestone 21 pelee island is the largest of islands accessible by ferry from leamington ontario and sandusky ohio the island has a fragile and unique ecosystem with plants rarely found in canada such as wild hyacinth yellow horse gentian triosteum angustifolium and prickly pear cactus as well as two endangered snakes the blue racer and the lake erie water snake songbirds migrate to pelee in spring and monarch butterflies stop over during the fall 22 water levels edit lake erie has a lake retention time of 2.6 years 23 the shortest of all the great lakes 24 the surface area is 9,910 square miles 2 2 25 lake water level fluctuates with the seasons as in the other great lakes generally the lowest levels are in january and february and the highest in june or july although there have been exceptions the average yearly level varies depending on long term precipitation short term level changes are often caused by seiches that are particularly high when southwesterly winds blow across the length of the lake during storms these cause water to pile up at the eastern end of the lake storm driven seiches can cause damage onshore during one storm in november 2003 the water level at buffalo rose by 7 feet with waves of feet metres for a rise of 22 feet 26 meanwhile at the western end of the lake toledo experienced a similar drop in water level lake water is used for drinking purposes 27 historic high water the lake fluctuates from month to month with the highest lake levels in june and july in the summer of 1986 lake erie reached its highest level at 5.08 feet above datum 28 the high water records were set from 1986 april through january 1987 levels ranged from 5.08 feet above chart datum 28 historic low water lake erie experiences its lowest levels in the winter in the winter of 1934 lake erie reached its lowest level at 1.5 feet below datum 28 monthly low water records were set from july 1934 through june 1935 during this twelve month period water levels ranged from 1.5 feet to the chart datum 28 geology edit sandy bluffs along lake erie in erie county pennsylvania lake erie and lake saint clair bathymetric map 29 30 31 32 the deepest point is marked with 33 lake erie was carved out by glacier ice 1 and in its current form is less than 4,000 years old which is a short span in geological terms before this the land on which the lake now sits went through several complex stages a large lowland basin formed over two million years ago as a result of an eastern flowing river that existed well before the pleistocene ice ages this ancient drainage system was destroyed by the first major glacier in the area while it deepened and enlarged the lowland areas allowing water to settle and form a lake the glaciers were able to carve away more land on the eastern side of the lowland because the bedrock is made of shale which is softer than the carbonate rocks of dolomite and limestone on the western side thus the eastern and central basins of the modern lake are much deeper than the western basin which averages only 25 feet deep and is rich in nutrients and fish 34 lake erie is the shallowest of the great lakes because the ice was relatively thin and lacked erosion power when it reached that far south according to one view as many as three glaciers advanced and retreated over the land causing temporary lakes to form in the time periods in between each of them because each lake had a different volume of water their shorelines rested at differing elevations the last of these lakes to form lake warren existed between about 13,000 and 12,000 years ago it was deeper than the current lake erie so its shoreline existed about eight miles inland from the modern one the shorelines of these lakes left behind high ground sand ridges that cut through swamps and were used as trails for indians and later pioneers these trails became primitive roads which were eventually paved u s route 30 west of delphos and u s route 20 west of norwalk and east of cleveland were formed in this manner one can still see some of these ancient sand dunes that formed in the oak openings region in northwestern ohio there the sandy dry lake bed soil was not enough to support large trees with the exception of a few species of oaks forming a rare oak savanna 35 history edit native americans edit at the time of european contact there were several groups of indian cultures living around the shores of the eastern end of the lake the erie tribe from whom the lake takes its name lived along the southern edge while the neutrals also known as attawandaron lived along the northern shore near port stanley there is an indian village dating from the 16th century known as the southwold earthworks where as many as 800 neutral indians once lived the archaeological remains include double earth walls winding around the grass covered perimeter 22 europeans named the tribe the neutral indians since these people refused to fight with other tribes 22 both tribes were conquered and assimilated by their hostile eastern neighbors the iroquois confederacy between ad 1651 and 1657 in what is referred to as part of the beaver wars 36 for decades after those wars the land around eastern lake erie was claimed and utilized by the iroquois as a hunting ground as the power of the iroquois waned during the last quarter of the 17th century several other mainly anishinaabe native american tribes displaced them from the territories they claimed on the north shore of the lake 37 there was a legend of an indian woman named huldah who despairing over her lost british lover hurled herself from a high rock from pelee island 18 european exploration and settlement edit the steamship walk in water built in buffalo was the first steamship on lake erie picture circa 1816 in 1669 the frenchman louis jolliet was the first documented european to sight lake erie although there is speculation that may have come across it in 1615 38 lake erie was the last of the great lakes to be explored by europeans since the iroquois who occupied the niagara river area were in conflict with the french and they did not allow explorers or traders to pass through explorers followed rivers out of lake ontario and portaged directly into lake huron british authorities in canada were nervous about possible expansion by american settlers across lake erie so colonel talbot developed the talbot trail in 1809 as a way to stimulate settlement to the area talbot recruited settlers from ireland and scotland and there are numerous places named after him such as port talbot and the talbot river and talbotville in southern ontario 22 commander perry s message after the battle of lake erie we have met the enemy and they are ours this 1865 painting by william h powell shows perry transferring to a different ship during the battle during the war of 1812 oliver hazard perry captured an entire british fleet in 1813 39 near put in bay ohio despite having inferior numbers 40 american soldiers swept through the ontario area around port rowan burning towns and villages but spared a gristmill owned by a canadian mason named john backhouse according to one report 22 generally however despite the two exceptions being the american revolutionary war and the war of 1812 which involved conflicts between the u s and great britain relations between the u s and canada have been remarkably friendly with an unfortified boundary and an agreement that has kept all fleets of war off the great lakes 41 in 1837 rebellions broke about between canadian settlers and the british colonial government primarily over political reforms and land allocation issues some of the rebels stationed themselves in the u s and crossed the ice from sandusky bay to pelee island wearing tattered overcoats and worn out boots and carrying muskets pitchforks and swords 18 but the islanders had already fled 18 later there was a battle on the ice with the royal 32nd regiment with the rebels being driven to retreat 18 at an ohio history festival the 19th century style brig warship uss niagara passes the lorain lighthouse settlers established commercial fisheries on the north coast of the lake around the 1850s 42 an important business was fishing 23 in the pre civil war years railways sprouted everywhere and around 1852 there were railways circling the lake 43 maritime traffic picked up although the lake was usually closed because of ice from december to early april and ships had to wait for the ice to clear before proceeding 44 since slavery had been abolished in canada in 1833 but was still legal in southern states of the u s a lake erie crossing was sometimes required for fugitive slaves seeking freedom when kentucky fugitive lewis clarke arrived in cleveland he had no idea how to find canada i went out to the shore of the lake again and again to try and see the other side but i could see no hill mountain nor city of the asylum i sought he once told an interviewer i was afraid to inquire where canada was lest it would betray such a degree of ignorance as to excite suspicion at once many fugitives also had to overcome fears instilled by their former masters chris lackner in the ottawa citizen 2006 45 merchant shippers lacked modern radar and weather forecasting so vessels were often caught up in intense gales a violent gale is blowing on lake erie the schooner stranger came in this morning and reports seeing a vessel about 12 miles up 2 miles from the canada shore with three men clinging to the masts which alone were visible above the their cries and screams the new york times october 1853 46 there were reports of disasters usually from sea captains passing information to reporters in 1868 the captain of the grace whitney saw a sunken vessel three men clinging to the masthead but he could not help because of the gale and high seas 47 a balloonist named john steiner of philadelphia made an ambitious trip across the lake in 1857 48 he was described in the new york times as an eronaut or aeronaut powered boats were called propellers and fast was deemed railroad speed an account of the day long voyage over the lake he arose to the height of about three miles and started off at a slow but steady rate the lake could be seen from one end to the other nearly at one time mr steiner counted 38 sail vessels all in sight and far below him the hands on board several of the vessels saw him and rightly apprehending that he was an aeronaut cheered him heartily he neared the canada shore a little below long point he was accordingly driven towards buffalo night was drawing on and it became apparent that he could not with this current get away from the water before dark and after nightfall it would not be safe to come down seeing a propeller the mary stewart he first struck the water about 25 miles below long point during this time mr steiner says he thinks his balloon bounded from the water at least twenty times it would strike and then rebound like a ball going into the air from twenty to fifty feet and still rushing down the lake at railroad speed mr steiner then abandoned the balloon leaping into the water and swimming towards the boat which speedily reached him the new york times july 23 1857 48 in 1885 lake winds were so strong that water levels dropped substantially sometimes by as much as two feet so that at ports such as toledo watercraft could not load coal or depart the port 49 during the history of the lake as a fishery there has been marked battling by opposing interest groups an 1895 newspaper account in which critics of commercial fishing issued dire predictions and calling for government action to solve the problem the preservation of the fisheries of lake erie has become a serious problem to all who have given it close attention the fisheries are being exhausted by the wasteful methods which are now in vogue it is still the custom of the pound fishermen about sandusky to take fish of all sizes and if they are too small to be marketable they are turned over to a fertilizer factory if left undisturbed for two or three years more these little fish would be a very valuable product the new york times 1895 50 view from the peace memorial at put in bay ohio predictions of the lake being over fished in 1895 were premature since the fishery has survived commercial and sport fishing pollution in the middle of the 20th century invasive species and other ailments but state and provincial governments as well as national governments have played a greater role as time went by business boomed in 1901 the carnegie company proposed building a new harbor near erie in elk creek to accommodate shipments from its tube plant site nearby 51 in 1913 a memorial to commodore perry was built on put in bay island featuring a doric column 41 during the prohibition years from 1919 to 1933 a great deal of alcohol crossed erie 18 along with mobster corpses dumped into the detroit river which sometimes washed up on the beaches of pelee island 52 according to one account al capone hid a fortune in the walls of the middle island luxury club but no money was found in it as of 2007 when the building no longer stood 18 the club had a basement casino with poker tables and slot machines 18 during the 20th century commercial fishing was prevalent but so was the boom in manufacturing industry around the lake and often rivers and streams were used as sewers to flush untreated sewage which ended up in the lake 53 sometimes poorly constructed sanitary systems meant that when old mains broke raw sewage would spill directly into the cuyahoga and into the lake 53 a report in time magazine in 1969 described the lake as a gigantic cesspool since only three of 62 beaches were rated completely safe for swimming 53 by 1975 the popular commercial fish blue pike had been declared extinct although the declaration may have been premature 54 by the 1980s there were about 130 fishing vessels with about 3,000 workers 42 but commercial fishing was declining rapidly particularly from the american side great lakes compact edit main article great lakes compact in 2005 the great lakes states of ohio michigan new york pennsylvania illinois indiana wisconsin minnesota and the canadian provinces of ontario and quebec endorsed the great lakes st lawrence river basin sustainable water resources compact compact the compact was signed into law by president george w bush in september 2008 an international water rights policy overseen by the great lakes commission the compact aims to prevent diversion of water from great lakes to distant states as well as to set standards for use and conservation it had support from both political parties including former united states senator george voinovich r oh and former governor jennifer granholm d mi but is not popular in the southwestern states due to frequent drought conditions and water scarcity lake environment edit weather edit lake erie in winter edit cold air travels over warm lake water the air becomes warmer moister less dense so that it rises when it passes over land the reduced airspace causes the air to pile up resulting in frictional convergence this lifts the air even further to where it cools turning into droplets or snowflakes the result is enhanced snowfall 55 tornadoes rarely happen around the immediate great lakes region although this one happened in 1953 in erie michigan near lake erie lake erie in winter like the other great lakes erie produces lake effect snow when the first cold winds of winter pass over the warm waters when the difference in temperature between the relatively warm surface water and the colder air reaches a threshold value of 18 to 23 degrees fahrenheit 10 to 13 degrees celsius then lake effect snow becomes possible 55 as cold air flows over the warm water the lake warms and moistens the air since warm moist air is less dense than cold air the heated air rises rising air cools and water vapor condenses into cloud droplets the efficiency of snow production increases when the wind pushes the clouds over land friction with the ground causes air to pile up this frictional convergence creates lift and enhances snowfall bob swanson and adrienne lewis of usa today 2008 55 heavy lake effect snowfalls can occur when cold air travels 60 miles or longer over a large unfrozen lake 55 lake effect snow makes buffalo and erie the eleventh and thirteenth snowiest places in the entire united states respectively according to data collected from the national climatic data center 56 since winds blow primarily along the main axis of the lake lake effect snow effects are more pronounced on the eastern parts of the lake such as cities such as buffalo and erie buffalo typically gets 95 inches of snow each winter and sometimes ten feet of snow 57 the snowiest city is syracuse new york which can receive heavy snowfall from both the lake effect process and large coastal cyclones a storm around christmas in 2001 pounded buffalo with seven feet of snow 58 lake erie in winter the lake effect ends or its effect is reduced however when the lake freezes over in january 2011 for example residents of cleveland were glad when lake erie was 90 percent frozen since it meant that the area had made it over the hump in terms of enduring repeated snowfalls which required much shoveling 59 being the shallowest of the great lakes it is the most likely to freeze and frequently does 60 on february 16 2010 meteorologists reported that the lake had frozen over marking the first time the lake had completely frozen over since the winter of 61 in contrast lake michigan has never completely frozen over since the warmer and deeper portion is in the south although it came close to being totally frozen during three harsh winters over the past century 62 when the lake freezes over this usually shuts down the lake effect snowfall 63 in past years lake ice was so thick that it was possible to drive over it or go sailing on iceboats but in the first decade of the 21st century the ice has not been thick enough for such activities 52 many lake residents take advantage of the ice and travel some drive to canada and back 64 one account of ice life around put in bay the first ice usually forms in late november and by january it locks into place for islanders in the western basin it is the equivalent of summer vacation once the lake freezes islanders organize impromptu ice rallies families gather to drink hot wine and race all terrain vehicles across the lake they also race iceboats which resemble sailboats on skates many people drive to other islands for dinner with friends they ride in cars with the roofs and doors chopped off so they can escape if the vehicles fall through the ice islanders stab evergreen trees into the ice every 50 yards to mark a route even in the coldest winters there are dangerous patches of thin ice the cracks are so predictable that the put in bay ice yacht club prints them on a map on a normal winter day the ice is dotted with 2,000 fishing shanties christopher maag in the new york times 2004 64 windy conditions edit strong winds have caused lake currents to shift sediment on the bottom leading to wickedly shifting sandbars which have been a source of shipwrecks 52 but winds can have a peaceful purpose as well there have been proposals to place wind turbines in windy and shallow points in the lake and along the coast both in the united states and canada in 2010 there were plans for ge to develop five wind turbines to generate 20 megawatts of power by 2012 with plans to generate 1,000 megawatts by 2020 one proposal called for gearless turbines with 176 foot long blades helped along with magnets 65 66 a nonprofit development group near cleveland was developing plans to construct hundreds of turbines in the lake 67 a former steel mill site on the eastern edge of the lake in buffalo ny has been redeveloped as an urban wind farm in 2007 known as steel winds the project currently houses 14 turbines capable of generating up to 35 megawatts of electricity 68 a plan by samsung to build an offshore wind farm on the north shore of the lake from port maitland to nanticoke for a distance of 69 but the plan has been met with opposition from residents for a number of reasons canadians near leamington and kingsville have organized protest groups to thwart attempts to bring wind turbines to the lake reasons against the turbines include spoiling lake views as well as possible adverse effects regarding drinking water and commercial fishing 70 plans to install turbines in pigeon bay south of leamington were met with opposition as well 71 72 the notion that bird and bat migration may be hurt by the wind turbines has been used to argue against the wind turbines a reporter in the globe and mail wrote given the tendency of turbines to make mincemeat of things airborne it require great imagination to figure out what would happen 70 they loom like gigantic aliens invading the fields there are 66 of these creatures each about as tall as a 25 storey building with a face comprised of three enormous whiskers rotating 11 to 20 times per minute standing amidst the wind turbines of erie shore wind farm one feels like a doomed character in a sci fi movie caught in the deathly still moment just before disaster strikes reporter rebecca field jager in the weekend post 2010 73 microclimates edit the lake is also responsible for microclimates that are important to agriculture along its north shore is one of the richest areas of fruit and vegetable production this southernmost tip particularly in the area around leamington is known as tomato capital 70 the area around port rowan in ontario has special trees which grow because of the tempering effect of the lake and species include tulip trees flowering dogwood sassafras and sour gum 22 in this area there are many greenhouses which produce a variety of tropical plants rarely cultivated so far north including some species of cacti because of the tempering effect 22 along the southeastern shore in ohio pennsylvania and new york is an important grape growing region as are the islands in the lake apple orchards are abundant in northeast ohio to western new york long term weather patterns edit according to one estimate 34 to 36 inches of water evaporates each year from the surface of the lake 1 which allows for rainfall and other precipitation in surrounding areas there are conflicting reports about the overall effect of global warming on the great lakes region citation needed including lake erie one account suggests that climate change is causing greater evaporation of lake water leading to warmer temperatures as well as ice in winter which is less thick or nonexistent fueling concerns that erie appears to be shrinking and is the most likely candidate among the five great lakes to turn into a festering mud puddle 52 in 2010 the windsor star reported that the lake experienced record breaking temperatures reaching in mid august and compared the lake to a bath tub 74 but the long term weather patterns are subject to controversy citation needed ecosystems edit a coal fired power plant in avon lake ohio located on lake erie lake erie has a complex ecosystem with many species in constant interaction human activity such as pollution and maritime ship traffic can affect this environment in numerous ways the interactions between the new species can sometimes have beneficial effects as well as harmful effects some introductions have been seen as beneficial such as the introduction of pacific salmon 52 occasionally there have been mass die offs of certain species of fish sometimes for reasons unknown such as many numbers of rainbow smelt in may 2010 75 invasive species edit the lake has been plagued with a number of invasive species including zebra 52 and quagga mussels the goby and the grass carp one estimate was that there have been 180 invasive species in the great lakes some having traveled in ballast water in international ships 76 zebra mussels and gobies have been credited with the increased population and size of smallmouth bass in lake erie 77 in 2008 there were concerns that the newest invader swarming in the great lakes which was the bloody red shrimp might harm fish populations and promote algae blooms 78 environmentalists and biologists study lake conditions via installations such as the franz theodore stone laboratory on gibraltar island the lab which was established in 1895 is the oldest biological field station in the united states stone laboratory was donated to the ohio state university by julius stone in 1925 as part of the ohio sea grant college program 34 76 in addition the great lakes institute of the university of windsor has experts who study issues such as lake sediment pollution and the flow of contaminants such as phosphorus 76 a list of the common invasive species in lake erie include zebra mussels quagga mussels round gobies spiny european water fleas fishhook water fleas the sea lamprey and white perch the invasive plant species that fill lake erie consist mainly of eurasian milfoil and purple loosestrife eutrophication and the infamous dead zone edit a 1973 photo from the u s environmental protection agency showing beach erosion algae and uprooted trees as a result of environmental issues the green scum shown in this image taken in october 2011 is the worst algae bloom lake erie has experienced in decades an ongoing concern is that nutrient overloading from fertilizers human and animal waste known as eutrophication in which additional nitrogen and phosphorus enter the lake will cause plant life to run wild and multiply like crazy 11 since there are fewer wetlands which are like kidneys by filtering nutrients as well as greater channelization of waterways nutrients in water can cause algal blooms to sprout as well as low oxygen dead zones in a complex interaction of natural forces 11 as of the 2010s much of the phosphorus in the lake comes from fertilizer applied to no till soybean and corn fields but washed into streams by heavy rains the algal blooms result from growth of microcystis a toxic blue green algae that the zebra mussels which infest the lake eat 12 there periodically is a dead zone or region of low oxygen in the lake whose exact location varies scientists from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration have been studying the blue green algae blooms and trying to find ways to predict when they are spreading or where they might hit landfall typically the blooms arrive late each summer 13 this problem was extreme in the mid and late and the lake erie wastewater management study lewms conducted by the buffalo district of the us army corps of engineers determined that the eutrophication was due to point sources such as industrial outfalls and municipal sanitary and storm sewer outfalls as well as diffuse sources such as overland runoff from farm and forest land all these sources contribute nutrients primarily phosphorus to the lake growth of organisms in the lake is then spiked to the point that oxygen levels are depleted lewms made recommendations for reducing point source outflows as well as reducing farm contributions of phosphorus by changing fertilizer usage employing no till farming and other conservative practices many industrial and municipal sources have since then been greatly reduced the improved farming practices which were voluntary were followed for a while resulting in remarkable recovery of the lake in the 1970s 79 unfortunately the conservative practices are not monitored and have not been kept up one recent account suggests that the seasonal algae blooms in lake erie were possibly caused by runoff from cities fertilizers zebra mussels and livestock near water 13 a second report focuses on the zebra mussels as being the cause of big oxygen poor dead zones since they filter so much sediment that they have resulted in the growth of algae 52 one report suggests the oxygen poor zone began about 1993 in the central basin and becomes more pronounced during summer months but it is somewhat of a mystery why this happens 80 some scientists speculate that the dead zone is a naturally occurring phenomenon 76 another report cited maumee river as the main source of polluted runoff of phosphorus from industries municipalities tributaries and agriculture and in 2008 satellite images showed the algal bloom heading toward pelee island and possibly heading to lake central basin 76 there have been two year $2 million studies trying to understand the growing zone which was described as a 10 foot thick layer of cold water at the bottom 55 feet in one area which stretches 100 miles across the center 80 it kills fish and microscopic creatures of the food chain and fouls the water and may cause further problems in later years for sport and commercial fishing 80 algae blooms continued in early 2013 but new farming techniques climate change and even a change in lake ecosystem make phosphorus pollution more intractable 81 snakes edit the northern watersnake nerodia sipedon is nonvenomous the lake erie water snake a subspecies of the northern water snake nerodia sipedon lives in the vicinity of put in bay harbor and had been put on the threatened species list 82 a threatened species is one which may soon become an endangered species 83 by 2010 the water snake population was over 12,000 snakes 82 while they have a non venomous bite they are a key predator in the aquatic ecosystem since they feed on mudpuppies and walleye and smallmouth bass 82 the snake was helpful in keeping the population of goby fish in check 82 they mate from late may through early june and can be found in large mating balls with one female bunched with several males 83 asian carp edit there is a concern that asian carp might enter the great lakes region and alter the ecosystem negatively 42 they have been described as greedy giants that suck plankton from the water with the brutal efficiency of vacuum cleaners and scientists worry that they may unravel the aquatic food web by crowding out other species 42 snakehead fish edit snakehead fish there was concern in 2007 that snakehead fish could get into the great lakes area 84 officials warn that if the fish invades it could decimate the aquatic food chain 84 a youtube video mentioned in a newspaper account has a man claiming that the fish could bite your entire hand off the fish can reach in length and survive out of water for four days and has a mouth full of teeth that can shear fish in half and can eat ducks and small mammals 84 it should be noted however the snakehead fish can not live in a lake that has completely frozen over they must come to the surface to breathe via their swim bladder it gets such huge sizes it moves over land and it breathes air and it will eat anything it comes into contact with what freaks people out about it to see a fish moving across land gulping air about the snakehead fish 2007 canwest news service 84 agriculture and life around the lake edit in 1999 doppler radar weather sensors detected millions of mayflies heading for presque isle in blue and green splotches on the radar in clouds measuring ten miles long 85 these insects were a sign of lake move back to health since the mayflies require clean water to thrive 85 biologist masteller of penn state erie declared the bugs to be a nice nuisance since they signified the return to health after forty years of absence 85 each is an inch and a half long the three main species of mayflies are ephemera simulans hexagenia rigida and hexagenia limbata 85 the insects mate over a 72 hour period from june through september they fly in masses up to the shore mate in the air then females lay up to 8,000 eggs each over the water the eggs sink back down and the cycle repeats 85 sometimes the clouds of mayflies have caused power outages 86 as well as causing roads to become slippery with squashed insects 85 since zebra mussels filter extra nutrients from the lake it allows the mayfly larvae to thrive 86 the trumpeter swan cygnus buccinator on lake erie there have been incidents of birds dying from botulism in 2000 87 and in 2002 88 birds affected included grebes common and red breasted mergansers loons diving ducks ring billed gulls and herring gulls 87 one account suggests that bird populations are in trouble notably the woodland warbler which had population declines around 60 percent in 2008 52 possible causes for declines in bird populations are farming practices loss of habitats soil depletion and erosion and toxic chemicals 52 in 2006 there were concerns of possible bird flu after two wild swans on the lake were found diseased but it was learned that they did not contain the deadly h5n1 virus 89 there were sightings of a magnificent frigatebird a tropical bird with a two metre wingspan over the lake in 2008 90 water quality issues and restoration edit lake erie infamously became very polluted in the 1960s and 1970s as a result of the quantity of heavy industry situated in cities on its shores with reports of bacteria laden beaches and fish contaminated by industrial waste 91 in the 1970s patches of the lake were declared dead because of industrial waste as well as sewage from runoffs as the new york times reporter denny lee wrote in 2004 the lake after all is where the rust belt meets the water 17 the water quality deteriorated partially due to increasing levels of the nutrient phosphorus 76 in both the water and lake bottom sediments the resultant high nitrogen levels in the water caused eutrophication which resulted in algal blooms and algae masses 92 and fish kills increasingly fouled the shoreline during this period there were incidents of the oily surfaces of tributary rivers emptying into lake erie catching fire in 1969 cuyahoga river erupted in flames 92 chronicled in a time magazine article which lamented a tendency to use rivers flowing through major cities as convenient free sewers 53 the detroit river caught fire on another occasion 52 the outlook was gloomy each day detroit cleveland and 120 other municipalities fill erie with 1.5 billion gallons of inadequately treated wastes including nitrates and phosphates these chemicals act as fertilizer for growths of algae that suck oxygen from the lower depths and rise to the surface as odoriferous green scum commercial and game pike whitefish sturgeon northern nearly vanished yielding the waters to trash fish that need less oxygen weeds proliferate turning water frontage into swamp in short lake erie is in danger of dying by suffocation time magazine august 1969 53 these events embarrassed officials and spurred local officials including director of public utilities ben stefanski to pursue a massive effort to scrub the cuyahoga the effort cost $100 million in bonds according to one estimate 53 new sewer lines were built 53 clevelanders approved a bond issue by 2 to 1 to seriously upgrade sewage system 53 federal officials acted as well the united states congress passed the clean water act of 1972 92 93 in that year the united states and canada established water pollution limits in an international water quality agreement the corps lewms mentioned above was also instituted at that time the controls were effective but it took several decades to take effect by 1999 there were signs that large numbers of mayflies were spotted on the lake after a forty year absence signalling a return to health 17 85 the clearing of the water column is also partly due to the introduction and rapid spread of zebra mussels from europe which had the effect of covering the basin floor like shag carpeting with each creature filtering a liter of fresh water a day helping to restore the lake to a cleaner state 17 the 1972 great lakes water quality agreement also significantly reduced the dumping and runoff of phosphorus into the lake the lake has since become clean enough to allow sunlight to infiltrate its water and produce algae and sea weed but a dead zone persists in the central lake erie basin during the late summer the united states environmental protection agency has studied this cyclic phenomenon since 2005 94 there have been instances of beach closings at presque isle off the coast of northwestern pennsylvania because of unexplained e coli contaminations 95 possibly caused by storm water overflows after heavy downpours daybreak with cleveland skyline sunset from cleveland pier since the 1970s environmental regulation has led to a great increase in water quality and the return of economically important fish species such as walleye and other biological life 96 there was substantial evidence that the new controls had substantially reduced levels of ddt in the water by 1979 27 cleanup efforts were described in 1979 as a notable environmental success story suggesting that the cumulative effect of legislation studies and bans had reversed the effects of pollution 27 the globs of oil the multicolored industrial discharges the flotsam from shoreline cities the fecal and bacterial wastes are no longer dumped in the lakes in vast quantities time magazine 1979 27 joint agreements pushed 600 of 864 major industrial dischargers to meet requirements for keeping the water clean 27 one estimate was that was spent to upgrade plants to treat sewage 27 the change toward cleaner water has been in a positive direction since the 1970s other ecosystem related issues edit there was a tentative exploratory plan to capture co 2 compress it to a liquid form and pump it a half mile 800 m beneath lake surface underneath the porous rock structure 97 according to chemical engineer peter douglas there is sufficient storage space beneath lake erie to hold between 15 and 50 years of liquid co2 emissions from the 4,000 megawatt nanticoke coal plant 97 but there has been no substantial progress on this issue since 2007 economy edit fishing edit species of fish edit summer morning west of cleveland lake erie is home to one of the largest freshwater commercial fisheries lake fish populations are the most abundant of the great lakes partially because of the relatively mild temperatures and plentiful supply of plankton which is the basic building block of the food chain 42 the fish population accounts for an estimated 50% of all fish inhabiting the great lakes 98 the lake is loaded with superstars such as steelhead 99 walleye american usage or pickerel canadian usage 42 99 smallmouth bass 99 perch 99 as well as bass trout salmon whitefesh smelt and many others 42 the lake consists of a long list of well established introduced species common non indigenous fish species include the rainbow smelt alewife white perch and common carp non native sport fish such as rainbow trout and brown trout are stocked specifically for anglers to catch attempts failed to stock coho salmon and its numbers are once again dwindling commercial landings are dominated by yellow perch and walleye with substantial quantities of rainbow smelt and white bass also taken anglers target walleye and yellow perch with some effort directed at rainbow trout a variety of other species are taken in smaller quantities by both commercial and sport fleets up until the end of the 1950s the most commonly caught commercial fish more than 50% of the commercial catch was a subspecies of the walleye known as the blue walleye sander vitreus glaucus sometimes erroneously called blue pike in the 1970s and 1980s as pollution in the lake declined counts of walleyes which were caught grew from 112,000 in 1975 to 4.1 million in 1985 with estimates of the numbers of walleyes in the lake at around 33 million in the basin with many of 8 pounds or more 100 not all walleyes thrived the combination of overfishing and the eutrophication of the lake by pollution caused the population to collapse and in the mid 1980s one species of walleye called the blue walleye was declared extinct but the lake erie walleye was reportedly having record numbers even in 1989 according to one report 101 there have been concerns about rising levels of mercury in walleye fish a study by the canadian ministry of the environment noted an increasing concentration trend but that limits were within acceptable established by authorities in pennsylvania 102 it was recommended because of pcbs that persons eat no more than one walleye meal per month 102 because of these and other concerns in 1990 the national wildlife federation was on the verge of having a negative fish consumption advisory for walleyes and smallmouth bass which had been the bread and butter catch of an $800 million commercial fishing industry 103 the longest fish in lake erie is reportedly the sturgeon which can grow to ten feet long and weight 300 pounds but it is an endangered species and mostly lives on the bottom of the lake 104 in 2009 there was a confirmed instance of a sturgeon being caught which was returned to the lake alive and there are hopes that the population of sturgeons is resurging 105 commercial fishing edit sunset on lake erie seen through a fishing net estimates vary about the fishing market for the great lakes region one estimate of the total market for fishing including commercial as well as sport or recreational fishing for all of the great lakes was $4 billion annually in 2007 13 a second estimate was that the fishing industry was valued at more than $7 billion 42 but since high levels of pollution were discovered in the 1960s and 1970s there has been continued debate over the desired intensity of commercial fishing commercial fishing in lake erie has been hurt by the bad economy as well as government regulations which limit the size of their catch one report suggested that the numbers of fishing boats and employees had declined by two thirds in recent decades 42 another concern had been that pollution in the lake as well as toxins found inside fish were working against commercial fishing interests 92 u s fishermen based along lake erie lost their livelihood over the past few decades described as being caught in a net of laws and bans according to the pittsburgh post gazette and no longer catch fish such as whitefish for markets in new york 23 pennsylvania had a special $3 stamp on fishing licenses to help compensate commercial fishermen for their losses but this program ended after five years turning commercial fishing industry into an artifact 23 one blamed the commercial fishing ban after a test of wills between commercial and recreational fishermen one side needed large hauls the other feared the lake was being emptied 23 commercial fishing is now predominantly based in canadian communities with a much smaller restricted to yellow perch ohio one account suggested that canadian fishermen are still at it and making money and they know how to fish by using the old nets 23 the ontario fishery is one of the most intensively managed in the world however there are reports that some canadian commercial fishermen are dissatisfied with fishing quotas and have sued their government about this matter and there have been complaints that the legislative body writing the quotas is dominated by the u s and that sport fishing interests are favored at the expense of commercial fishing interests 106 cuts of 30 to 45 percent for certain fish were made in 2007 106 the lake erie fishery was one of the first fisheries in the world managed on individual transferable quotas and features mandatory daily catch reporting and intensive auditing of the catch reporting system still the commercial fishery is the target of critics who would like to see the lake managed for the exclusive benefit of sport fishing and the various industries serving the sport fishery in november 2010 oldest and largest fish processor known as great lakes fish corporation was shut down after operating for a hundred years 130 workers were laid off and numerous spinoff jobs disappeared such as jobs at local restaurants and net repair shops 107 according to one report the canadian town of port dover is the home of the largest fishing fleet and the town features miniature golf dairy bars french fry stands and restaurants serving perch 22 government regulation of fishing edit the lake can be thought of as a common asset with multiple purposes including being a fishery there was direct competition between commercial fishermen and sport fishermen including charter boats and sales of fishing licenses throughout the history with both sides seeking government assistance from either washington or ottawa and trying to make their case in the court of public opinion through newspaper reporting 50 but other groups have entered the political process as well including environmentalists lakefront property owners industry owners and workers seeking cost effective solutions for sewage ferry boat operators even corporations making electric generating wind turbines management of the fishery is by consensus of all management agencies with an interest in the resource and include the states of new york pennsylvania ohio michigan and the province of ontario and work under the mandate of the great lakes fishery commission the commission makes assessments using sophisticated mathematical modeling systems the commission has been the focus of considerable recrimination primarily from angler and charter fishing groups in the u s which have had a historical antipathy to commercial fishing interests this conflict is complex dating from the 1960s and earlier with the result in the united states that in 2011 commercial fishing was mostly eliminated from great lakes states one report suggests that battling between diverse fishing interests began around lake michigan and evolved to cover the entire great lakes region 108 the analysis suggests that in the lake erie context the competition between sport and commercial fishing involves universals and that these conflicts are cultural not scientific and therefore not resolvable by reference to ecological data 109 sport fishing edit the lake also supports a strong sport fishery while commercial fishing declined sport fishing has remained the deep cool waters that spawn the best fishing is in the canadian side of the lake 110 as a result a fishing boat that crosses the international border triggers the security concerns of border crossings and fishermen are advised to have their passport 110 if their boat crosses the invisible border line in the lake upon returning to the american shore passengers will have to drive to a local government reporting station and pose for pictures to customs officers by videophone 110 there are cumbersome rules for fishing boat operators as well who will have to fax passenger personal information to a government agency an hour before leaving officers will be watching and doing spot checks from patrol boats and government aircraft 110 authorities in 2008 from the pennsylvania fish and boat commission have tried stocking the lake with brown trout in an effort to build called a put grow and take fishery 111 there was a report that charter boat fishing increased substantially on the american side from 46 to 638 charter boats in operation in ohio alone during a period from 1975 to 1985 as pollution levels declined and after populations of walleye increased substantially in the lake 100 in 1984 ohio sold 27,000 nonresident fishing permits and sport fishing was described as big business 100 in 1992 there were accounts of fishermen catching 8 10 and 12 pound walleyes and that the runt of a five man daily limit of 25 walleye might be a nuisance of 5 pounds 112 it is possible to fish off piers in winter for a fish called the burbot also known by pseudonyms such as eelpout mudblow lawyer fish cusk or freshwater cod which looks ugly but tastes great the burbot make a midwinter spawning run and is reportedly one of glacial relics 99 an ice auger used to bore hole for ice fishing ice fishing edit in winter when the lake freezes many fishermen go out on the ice cut holes and fish it is even possible to build bonfires on the ice 64 but venturing on lake erie ice can be dangerous in a freak incident in 2009 warming temperatures and winds of 35 miles per hour and currents pushing eastward dislodged a miles wide ice floe which broke away from the shore trapping more than 130 fishermen offshore one man died while the rest were rescued by helicopters or boats 113 the day began with fishermen setting down wooden pallets to create a bridge over a crack in the ice so they could roam farther out on the lake but the planks fell into the water when the ice shifted stranding the fishermen about 1,000 yards offshore when fishermen realized late saturday morning that the ice had broken away they began to debate the best way off some chose to sit and wait for authorities while others headed east in search of an ice bridge others managed to get to land on their own by riding their all terrain vehicles about five miles east to where ice broken away when the rescued fishermen made it to shore authorities had them line up single file to take down their names john seewer february 2009 113 sour cherry orchard on shoreline at leamington ontario agriculture edit winery on middle bass island the formerly more extensive lakebed creates a favorable environment for agriculture in the bordering areas of ontario ohio michigan pennsylvania and new york the lake erie sections of western new york state have a suitable climate for growing grapes and in chautauqua county there have been many vineyards and wineries in the area as well as in erie county in northwestern pennsylvania 114 much grape juice is produced in this region 114 the canadian region of lake north shore is becoming a more prominent wine region as well it has been dubbed the lake erie north shore or lens region and includes pelee island 115 and since it is farther north than comparable wine growing areas in the world the season is longer in terms of light 116 a longer growing season due to the lake moderated temperatures make the risk of early frosts less likely 116 the drainage basin has led to well fertilized soil the north coast of ohio is widely referred to as its nursery capital 117 tourism edit diving for shipwrecks edit lake erie is a favorite for divers since there are many shipwrecks perhaps 1,400 to 8,000 according to one estimate 39 of which about 270 are confirmed shipwreck locations 39 most wrecks are undiscovered but believed to be well preserved and in good condition and at most only 200 feet below the water surface 118 one report suggests there are more wrecks per square mile than any other freshwater location including wrecks from native american watercraft there are efforts to identify shipwreck sites and survey the lake floor to map the location of underwater sites possibly for further study or exploration 119 while the lake is relatively warmer than the other great lakes there is a thermocline meaning that as a diver descends the water temperature drops about 30 degrees fahrenheit change requiring a wetsuit 118 one estimate is that lake erie has a quarter of all 8,000 estimated shipwrecks in the great lakes 118 they are preserved because the water is cold and salt free creating intact time capsules down there 118 divers have a policy of not removing or touching anything at the wreck else the next person be able to see it when artifacts were removed on occasion it was met by outrage by the diving community 118 the cold conditions make diving difficult and strenuous requiring divers with skill and experience 118 one charter firm from western new york state takes about 1,500 divers to lake erie shipwrecks in a typical season from april through october 118 among the diving community they are considered world class offering opportunities to visit an underwater museum that most people will never see reporter shannon m nass of the pittsburgh post gazette 2010 118 the anthony wayne side wheel passenger and cargo steamship sank in 1850 but was rediscovered in 2006 by diver tom kowalczk about six miles north of vermilion ohio it is believed to be the oldest archaeological steamship wreck in lake erie according to the great lakes historical society in 1991 the 19th century sidewheeler atlantic was discovered 120 it had sunk in a collision with the ogdensburg a steamship sometimes referred to as a propeller according to 19th century parlance in 1852 six miles west of long point ontario and survivors from the atlantic were saved by the ogdensburg 120 121 one account suggests 130 people drowned 120 while another suggests about 20 drowned 121 the aftermath of the disaster led to calls for authorities to seize captains of both ships so that the cause of the collision may be correctly ascertained as well as calls for more lifeboats and improved life preservers since the earlier ones proved to be totally useless 121 there was speculation that the sunken vessel had been a gambling ship and therefore there might have been money aboard but most historians were skeptical 120 in 1998 the shipwreck of the vessel adventure was the first shipwreck registered with the state of ohio as an underwater archaeological site when it was discovered that the propeller had been removed and given to a junkyard the propeller was rescued days before being converted to scrap metal and brought back to the dive site and back to its underwater home 39 in 2003 divers discovered the steamer canobie near presque isle which sunk in 1921 119 other wrecks include the fish tub neal h dow 1910 the elderado steamer cum barge 1880 119 the w r hanna 39 the dundee which sank north of cleveland in 1900 39 the f h prince 39 and the craftsman 39 in 2007 the wreck of the steamship named after mad anthony wayne was found near vermilion ohio in 50 feet of water the vessel sank in 1850 after its boilers exploded and 38 people died 122 the wreck belongs to the state of ohio and salvaging it is illegal but divers can visit it after it is surveyed 122 in addition there are wrecks of smaller vessels with occasional drownings of fishermen 123 the finding of the well preserved wreck of the canadian built british troop transport warship caledonia sunk during the war of 1812 has led to accusations about plundering of the site and legal wrangling about whether the vessel should be resurfaced in time for the 2013 bicentennial 124 research into shipwrecks has been organized by the peachman lake erie shipwreck research center or plesrc located on the grounds of the great lakes historical society 39 in 2008 the great lakes historical society announced plans to survey the underwater battle site of the battle of lake erie in preparation for the bicentennial celebration of the battle in 2013 39 public parks edit presque isle state park is a peninsula that juts out into lake erie from pennsylvania and is popular during summers with swimmers and beachgoers there are numerous public parks around the lake in western

northwest shore near port rowan that extends 20 miles into lake erie which is a stopover for birds migrating as well as turtles one reporter found a turtle crossing sign along the road long point provincial park is located there and has been designated as a unesco biosphere reserve 22 in sand hill park east of port burwell there is a 450 foot high dune which is so steep it requires people to crawl like crabs to the summit but they are rewarded with spectacular lake views 73 crystal beach in the village of crystal beach ontario at the eastern end of the lake is one of many south facing beaches on the canadian side as such it is perfectly situated for sun lovers and bathers facing the sun from sunrise to spectacular sunset the beach is gently sloping with no sharp drop offs or rip currents and is usually cooled by southwest breezes even on the hottest days in southern michigan sterling state park offers campgrounds 1,300 acres for hiking biking fishing boating with a sand beach for sunbathing swimming and picnicking 126 biking edit the new york times reporter donna marchetti took a bike tour around the lake erie perimeter in 1997 traveling 40 miles per day and staying at bed

farmlands of southern ontario 22 there are few bike repair shops in ontario on the route 22 islands edit lichen moss and grasses on karstic limestone surface on island lake erie islands tend to be in the westernmost part of the lake and have different characters some of them include kelleys island has activities such as beach lounging hiking biking and viewing the deep glacial grooves in the bedrock limestone 21 pelee island is reached by ferry from leamington ontario or by plane or ferry in sandusky ohio and is the largest of the lake erie islands 22 the island has a unique ecosystem with plants rarely found in canada such as wild hyacinth yellow horse gentian and prickly pear cactus 22 there are two endangered snakes including the blue racer and the lake erie water snake songbirds migrate there in spring and monarch butterflies stop over during the fall 22 south bass island has the island village of put in bay ohio which attracts young crowds who sometimes are prone to general merriment 21 it has been described as a party island with scenic rocky cliffs with a year round population in the hundreds that grows during summer 21 kite surfing is increasingly popular on the lake water sports edit kayaking has become more popular along the lake particularly in places such as put in bay ohio 17 there are spectacular views with steep cliffs with exotic wildlife and 100 miles of paddle friendly shoreline 17 long distance swimmers have swum across the lake to set records for example a 15 year old amputee swam the 12 mile stretch across the lake in 2001 127 in 2008 14 year old jade scognamillo swam from new sturgeon point to crystal beach and completed the 11 9 mile 19 2 km swim in five hours 40 minutes and 35 seconds and also became the youngest swimmer to make the crossing 128 it is illegal for swimmers younger than 14 to attempt such a crossing 128 in port dover ontario brave swimmers do high dives at the annual polar bear swim on the beach in 2011 the

in 1997 found the ontario town of port stanley to be the prettiest of the port towns with a lively holiday air but no ticky tacky commercialism 22 vineyards edit there are numerous vineyards around the lake including ones on pelee island which makes wines including pinot noir riesling and chardonnay 22 summer rentals edit people can rent summer houses and cabins near the lake to enjoy the beaches swimming as well as be close to activities such as wine tours and fishing and water parks 133 presque isle is a peninsula jutting out into the lake in northwestern pennsylvania which has nice beaches although there were incidents in 2006 when beaches had to be closed because of unexplained unhealthy water conditions with e coli bacteria 95 it was described as a spit of sand trees and swamp that arcs off the shore with seafood restaurants and beautiful sunsets 23 pelee island southernmost point and only three miles away from ohio is a place that forces you to do nothing i spent the next

pleasure boat operators offer dinner cruises in the cleveland area on the cuyahoga river as well as lake erie 135 folklore edit lake erie monster there have been reports of persons spotting a creature akin to the loch ness monster but there have been no confirmed reports 104 there were reports in 1990 of people seeing a large creature moving in the water about 1,000 feet from their boat described as black in color about 35 feet long with a snakelike head and moved as fast as a boat 104 five other people reported seeing something similar on three separate occasions but there is no scientific evidence of such a creature 104 there is a beer named after the lake erie monster as well as a hockey team 136 there were reports of people spotting a sea creature in the 19th century which was sometimes called bessie or south bay bessie 136 navigating the locks in the welland canal lake erie mirage effect there have been sporadic reports of people in cleveland being able to see the canadian shoreline as if it were immediately offshore even though canada is 50 miles from cleveland it has been speculated that this is a weather related phenomenon working on similar principles as a mirage 137 shipping traffic edit sunset near a lake erie shipping port the lake has been a bustling thoroughfare for maritime vessels for centuries 118 119 ships headed eastward can take the welland canal 138 and a series of eight locks descending 326 feet to lake ontario which takes about 12 hours according to one source 22 thousands of ships make this journey each year 22 during the 19th century ships could enter the buffalo river and travel the erie canal eastward to albany then south to new york city along the hudson river generally there is heavy traffic on the lake except during the winter months from january through march when ice prevents vessels from traveling safely 138 in 2007 there was a protest against energy policy which allows the shipping of coal in the lake greenpeace activists climbed a ladder on a freighter and locked themselves to the conveyor belt device that helps to unload the cargo three activists were arrested and the ship was delayed for more than four hours and anti coal messages were painted on the ship 139 the ship traffic in lake erie being the highest among the great lakes 140 and roughest of the lakes has led to it having the highest number of known shipwrecks in the great lakes there have been other accidents as well for example in 2010 according to the star crewmen from the freighter hermann schoening were sickened by phosphine gas which had been used to fumigate or control pests rescuers took them by tugboat to receive medical attention 141 ports edit this article needs additional citations for verification please help improve this
