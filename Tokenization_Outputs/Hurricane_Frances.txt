wave finally began organizing early on august 24 4 and the system became a tropical depression that evening 5 good upper level outflow was observed in all but the eastern quadrants as the depression continued on its path 6 and the depression strengthened to tropical storm status on august 25 approximately 1,420 miles east of the lesser antilles 7 the tropical storm now named frances further intensified on august 26 in an environment of low vertical wind shear as its track bent to the west northwest 8 frances rapidly intensified developing an eye and reaching hurricane strength late that
