canadian heraldic authority the origins of the canadian upper atmosphere and space program can be traced back to the end of the second world war 3 between 1945 and 1960 canada undertook a number of small launcher and satellite related projects under the aegis of defence research including the development of the black brant rocket as well as series of advanced studies examining both orbital rendezvous and re entry 4 in 1957 scientists and engineers at the canadian defence research telecommunications establishment drte under the leadership of john h chapman embarked on a project initially known simply as s 27 or the topside sounder project this work would soon lead to the development of first satellite known as alouette 1 with the launch of alouette 1 in september 1962 canada became the third country to put an artificial satellite into space at the time canada only possessed upper atmospheric launch capabilities sounding rockets therefore alouette 1 was sent aloft by the american national aeronautics and space administration nasa from vandenberg air force base in lompoc california the technical excellence of the satellite which lasted for ten years instead of the expected one prompted the further study of the ionosphere with the joint canadian designed us launched isis satellite program this undertaking was designated an international milestone of electrical engineering by ieee in 1993 the launch of anik a 1 in 1972 made canada the first country in the world to establish its own domestic geostationary communication satellite network citation needed these and other space related activities in the 1980s compelled the canadian government to promulgate the canadian space agency act which established the canadian space agency the act received royal assent on may 10 1990 and came into force on december 14 1990 5 in 1999 the csa was moved from project based to a base funding and given a fixed annual budget of $300 million 1 the actual budget varies from year to year due to additional earmarks and special projects the mandate of the canadian space agency is to promote the peaceful use and development of space to advance the knowledge of space through science and to ensure that space science and technology provide social and economic benefits for canadians the canadian space mission statement says that the agency is committed to leading the development and application of space knowledge for the benefit of canadians and humanity presidents edit may 4 1992 larkin kerwin 6 may 4 july 15 1994 roland 7 november 21 2001 william macdonald evans 8 november 22

been a cooperating state of the european space agency esa since the 1970s 14 15 and has several formal and informal partnerships and collaborative programs with space agencies in other countries such as nasa isro jaxa and snsb collaboration with europe in space activities predated both the european space agency and the canadian space agency 14 from 1968 canada held observer status in the european space conference esc a ministerial level organization set up to determine future european space activities and it continued in this limited role after esa was created in 1975 14 since january 1 1979 canada has had the special status of a cooperating state with the esa 15 paying for the privilege and also investing in working time and providing scientific instruments which are placed on esa probes canada is allowed to participate in optional programs it also has to contribute to the general budget but not as much as associate membership would have entailed this status was unique at the time and remains so today on 15 december 2010 the accord was renewed for a further 10 years until 2020 15 by virtue of this accord canada takes part in esa deliberative bodies and decision making and in programmes and activities canadian firms can bid for and receive contracts to work on programmes the accord has a provision specifically ensuring a fair industrial return to canada the head of the canadian delegation to esa is the president of the canadian space agency as of february 2009 there are currently 30 canadians that are employed as staff members at esa distributed over various esa

mobile transporter during sts 111 the canadian space program is administered by the canadian space agency canada has contributed technology expertise and personnel to the world space effort especially in collaboration with esa and nasa in addition to its astronauts and satellites some of the most notable canadian technological contributions to space exploration include the canadarm on the space shuttle as well as the canadarm2 and the rest of the mobile servicing system on the international space station the canadarm and canadarm2 employ the advanced space vision system which allows more efficient use of the robotic arms another canadian technology of note is the orbiter boom sensor system which is an extension of the canadarm used to inspect the space thermal protection system for damage while in orbit citation needed canadian astronauts edit see also canadian astronaut corps there have been four recruiting campaigns for astronauts for the csa the first in 1983 led to the selection of roberta bondar marc garneau robert thirsk ken money bjarni tryggvason and steve maclean the second in 1992 selected chris hadfield julie payette dafydd williams and michael mckay on may 13 2009 it was announced after the completion of a third selection process that two new astronauts jeremy hansen and david saint jacques had been chosen 16 the latest recruitment campaign was launched in 2016 totaling 3,772 applicants for 2 candidates 17 nine canadians have participated in 17 manned mission in total 14 nasa space shuttle missions including one mission to mir and 3 roscosmos soyuz

space station securing flights for both of remaining active astronauts 19 in may 2016 the csa announced that david saint jacques would fly to the international space station aboard a roscosmos soyuz

launching of radarsat 2 in december 2007 and completion of c 1 4 billion contribution to the international space station in early 2008 the csa found itself with no major follow on projects this fact was highlighted by marc garneau first astronaut and former head of the csa who in the fall of 2007 called upon the canadian government to develop and institute a space policy for canada a modest step has been taken to resolve this problem in november 2008 the agency signed a $40 million 16 month contract with macdonald dettwiler and associates of vancouver to begin the design of the radarsat constellation 3 satellite earth observation mission 33 in august 2010 further funding was awarded for detailed design work scheduled for completion by 2012 launch of the three satellites is scheduled for 2018 also in the 2009 federal budget the agency was awarded funding for the preliminary design of robotic lunar martian rovers 34 however a number of initiatives are without funding the csa is the lead agency for the polar communication and weather mission pcw which involves the planned launch of two satellites in polar orbit to provide canadian authorities with improved weather information and communications capabilities in the high arctic 35 launch of the two satellites was proposed to take place in 2016 funding for further development of the mission has yet to be approved 36 rockets edit a canadian black brant xii launching from wallops flight facility the canadian space agency has no indigenous launch system capability beyond upper atmospheric sounding rockets 33 37 canada relies on other countries such as the u s india and russia to launch its spacecraft into orbit but both the defence department and the space agency are looking at the option of constructing a canadian made launcher 37 38 the csa announced in 2011 it was researching locations in cape breton nova scotia or the potential reopening of the churchill rocket research range in manitoba for a micro satellite launch site to end its reliance on foreign launch providers 38 however canadian politicians seldom change funding without having at least some idea of the expected economic social and national defense benefits that could reasonably accrue to their constituents from the program another possible location cfb suffield remains an option 33 39 according to canadian space agency officials it would take 10 to 12 years for a full scale project to design and build a small satellite launcher 33 there has been no funding for these activities announced 40 although a new launch facility at canso nova scotia is in progress 2020 expected operation its intended use is for commercial launches of the ukrainian cyclone 4m rocket the facility is a project of the maritime launch services company any csa
