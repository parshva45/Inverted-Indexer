global precipitation measurement wikipedia global precipitation measurement from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search global precipitation measurement concept of the gpm core observatory mission type environmental research operator jaxa nasa cospar id 2014 009c satcat no 39574 mission duration planned 3 years elapsed spacecraft properties manufacturer nasa gsfc ball aerospace jaxa nict nec toshiba space systems launch mass 3,850 kilograms power 1.95 kw start of mission launch date february 27 2014 18 37 2014 02 27utc18 37 utc rocket h iia 202 f 23 launch site tanegashima contractor mitsubishi orbital parameters geocentric regime low earth semi major axis 6,779 kilometres perigee 400.9 kilometres apogee 415.3 kilometres inclination period 92.60 minutes epoch 26 march 2017 global precipitation measurement gpm is a joint mission between jaxa and nasa as well as other international space agencies to make frequent every hours observations of precipitation it is part of earth systematic missions program and works with a satellite constellation to provide full global coverage the project provides global precipitation maps to assist researchers in improving the forecasting of extreme events studying global climate and adding to current capabilities for using such satellite data to benefit society 1 gpm builds on the notable successes of the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm which was also a joint nasa jaxa activity the project is managed by goddard space flight center and consists of a gpm core observatory satellite assisted by a constellation of spacecraft from other agencies and missions 2 the core observatory satellite measures the two and three dimensional structure of precipitation patterns and provides a new calibration standard for the rest of the satellite constellation the gpm core observatory was assembled and tested at goddard space flight center and launched from tanegashima space center japan on a mitsubishi heavy industries h iia rocket the launch occurred on february 28 2014 at 3 37am jst on the first attempt 3 agencies in the united states japan india and france together with eumetsat operate the remaining satellites in the constellation for agency specific goals but also cooperatively provide data for gpm 2 contents 1 gpm core observatory instruments 1.1 dual

edit play media visualization of gpm collecting data on march 17th 2014 over the last major snow storm of winter 2013-2014 to hit the u s east coast the gpm core observatory in the electromagnetic testing chamber at nasa goddard space flight center in march 2013 the silver disc and drum center is the gpm microwave imager and the large block on the base is the dual frequency precipitation radar dual frequency precipitation radar dpr edit the dpr is a spaceborne radar providing three dimensional maps of storm structure across its swath including the intensity of rainfall and snowfall at the surface the dpr has two frequencies allowing researchers to estimate the sizes of precipitation particles and detect a wider range of precipitation rates the ku band radar similar to the pr on trmm covers a 152 mile swath nested inside that the ka band radar covers a 74.5 mile swath 4 gpm microwave imager gmi edit the gmi is a passive sensor that observes the microwave energy emitted by the earth and atmosphere at 13 different frequency polarization channels these data allow quantitative maps of precipitation across a swath that is 550 miles wide this instrument continues the legacy of trmm microwave observations while adding four additional channels better resolution and more reliable calibration 4 precipitation data sets edit gpm produces and distributes a wide variety of precipitation data products processing takes place at the precipitation processing system pps at nasa goddard space flight center as well as at the jaxa facility in japan data is provided at multiple levels of processing from raw satellite measurements to best estimate global precipitation maps using combinations of all the constellation observations and other meteorological data all data from the mission is made freely available to the public on nasa websites 5 precipitation data is made available in a variety of formats spatial and temporal resolutions and processing levels which are accessible on the precipitation measurement missions data access webpage 6 several data visualization and analysis tools have been made available to provide easy access for the science and applications communities which include the in browser earth science data analysis tool giovanni 7 a web api 8 and a 3d near realtime global precipitation viewer 9 full scale harness mockup model of the core gpm spacecraft being used for harness assembly inside the acoustic chamber at gsfc social media and outreach edit play media this animation shows gpm collecting some of its very first data on march 10th over a pacific storm east of japan in addition to maintaining social media accounts 10 11 12 and the gpm road to launch blog jaxa and nasa developed several outreach activities specific to this mission prior to launch that the public could participate in after launch a series of featured articles 13 and videos 14 were produced to highlight various scientific goals and discoveries of the mission and an extreme weather blog is maintained to provide timely updates about the latest extreme precipitation events and natural disasters occurring around the world a precipitation education website 15 is also maintained to provide teachers and students with lesson plans animations and other resources to teach about the water cycle earth science and the gpm mission nasa socials jaxa nasa
