responsible of the most expensive military with the second largest nuclear arsenal and leading the nation with the largest economy by nominal gdp the presidency holds significant hard and soft power both domestically and abroad in ordering the three branches of government article ii of the constitution vests the executive power of the united states in the president the power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law alongside the responsibility of appointing federal executive diplomatic regulatory and judicial officers and concluding treaties with foreign powers with the advice and consent of the senate the president is further empowered to grant federal pardons and reprieves and to convene and adjourn either or both houses of congress under extraordinary circumstances 15 the president is largely responsible for dictating the legislative agenda of the party to which the president is a member the president also directs the foreign and domestic policy of the united states 16 in addition article one of the united states constitution assigns to the president the power to sign legislation into law or to veto it since the office of president was established in 1789 its power has grown substantially as has the power of the federal government as a whole 17 the president is indirectly elected by the people through the electoral college to a four year term and is one of only two nationally elected federal officers the other being the vice president of the united states 18 nine vice presidents became president by virtue of a intra term death or

references 13 further reading 13.1 primary sources 14 external links origin in 1776 the thirteen colonies acting through the second continental congress declared political independence from great britain during the american revolution the new states though independent of each other as nation states 20 recognized the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the british 21 desiring to avoid anything that remotely resembled a monarchy congress negotiated the articles of confederation to establish an alliance between the states 20 as a central authority congress under the articles was without any legislative power it could make its own resolutions determinations and regulations but not any laws nor any taxes or local commercial regulations enforceable upon citizens 21 this institutional design reflected how americans believed the deposed british system of crown and parliament ought to have functioned with respect to the royal dominion a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire 21 out from under any monarchy the states assigned some formerly royal prerogatives e g making war receiving ambassadors etc to congress while severally lodging the rest within their own respective state governments only after all the states agreed to a resolution settling competing western land claims did the articles take effect on march 1 1781 when maryland became the final state to ratify them in 1783 the treaty of paris secured independence for each of the former colonies with peace at hand the states each turned toward their own internal affairs 20 by 1786 americans found their continental borders besieged and weak and their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another they witnessed their hard currency pouring into foreign markets to pay for imports their mediterranean commerce preyed upon by north african pirates and their foreign financed revolutionary war debts unpaid and accruing interest 20 civil and political unrest loomed following the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes between virginia and maryland at the mount vernon conference in 1785 virginia called for a trade conference between all the states set for september 1786 in annapolis maryland with an aim toward resolving further reaching interstate commercial antagonisms when the convention failed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other states alexander hamilton led the annapolis delegates in a call for a convention to offer revisions to the articles to be held the next spring in philadelphia prospects for the next convention appeared bleak until james madison and edmund randolph succeeded in securing george washington s attendance to philadelphia as a delegate for virginia 20 22 when the constitutional convention convened in may 1787 the 12 state delegations in attendance rhode island did not send delegates brought with them an accumulated experience over a diverse set of institutional arrangements between legislative and executive branches from within their respective state governments most states maintained a weak executive without veto or appointment powers elected annually by the legislature to a single term only sharing power with an executive council and countered by a strong legislature 20 new york offered the greatest exception having a strong unitary governor with veto and appointment power elected to a three year term and eligible for reelection to an indefinite number of terms thereafter 20 it was through the closed door negotiations at philadelphia that the presidency framed in the u s constitution emerged powers and duties article i legislative role president ronald reagan signing the martin luther king bill in 1983 the first power the constitution confers upon the president is the veto the presentment clause requires that any bill passed by congress to be presented to the president before it can become law once the legislation has been presented the president has three options sign the legislation within ten days excluding the bill becomes law veto the legislation within the above timeframe and return it to the house of congress in which it originated expressing any the bill does not become law unless both houses of congress vote to override the veto by a two thirds vote take no action on the legislation within the above the bill becomes law as if the president had signed it unless congress by their adjournment prevents its return in which case a it does not become law a legislative maneuver known as a pocket veto in 1996 congress attempted to enhance the veto power with the line item veto act the legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill particularly any new spending any amount of discretionary spending or any new limited tax benefit congress could then repass that particular item if the president then vetoed the new legislation congress could override the veto by its ordinary means a two thirds vote in both houses in clinton v city of new york 524 u s 417 1998 the u s supreme court ruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional article ii executive powers war and foreign affairs powers abraham lincoln the 16th president of the united states successfully preserved the union during the american civil war perhaps the most important of all presidential powers is the command of the united states armed forces as its commander in chief while the power to declare war is constitutionally vested in congress the president has ultimate responsibility for direction and disposition of the military the present day operational command of the armed forces belonging to the department of defense is normally exercised through the secretary of defense with assistance of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff to the combatant commands as outlined in the presidentially approved unified command plan ucp 23 24 25 the framers of the constitution took care to limit the powers regarding the military alexander hamilton explains this in federalist no 69 the president is to be commander in chief of the army and navy of the united states it would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces while that the power of the british king extends to the declaring of war and to the raising and regulating of fleets and armies all of which would appertain to the legislature 26 emphasis in the original congress pursuant to the war powers resolution must authorize any troop deployments longer than 60 days although that process relies on triggering mechanisms that have never been employed rendering it ineffectual 27 additionally congress provides a check to presidential military power through its control over military spending and regulation while historically presidents initiated the process for going to war 28 29 critics have charged that there have been several conflicts in which presidents did not get official declarations including theodore roosevelt s military move into panama in 1903 28 the korean war 28 the vietnam war 28 and the invasions of grenada in 1983 30 and panama in 1990 31 along with the armed forces the president also directs u s foreign policy through the department of state and the department of defense the president is responsible for the protection of americans abroad and of foreign nationals in the united states the president decides whether to recognize new nations and new governments and negotiates treaties with other nations which become binding on the united states when approved by two thirds vote of the senate citation needed administrative powers suffice it to say that the president is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the united states and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed william rehnquist nixon v general services administration 433 u s 425 1977 dissenting opinion the president is the head of the executive branch of the federal government and is constitutionally obligated to take care that the laws be faithfully executed 32 the executive branch has over four million employees including members of the military 33 presidents make numerous executive branch appointments an incoming president may make up to 6,000 before taking office and 8,000 more while serving ambassadors members of the cabinet and other federal officers are all appointed by a president with the advice and consent of a majority of the senate when the senate is in recess for at least ten days the president may make recess appointments 34 recess appointments are temporary and expire at the end of the next session of the senate the power of a president to fire executive officials has long been a contentious political issue generally a president may remove purely executive officials at will 35 however congress can curtail and constrain a authority to fire commissioners of independent regulatory agencies and certain inferior executive officers by statute 36 the president additionally possesses the ability to direct much of the executive branch through executive orders that are grounded in federal law or constitutionally granted executive power executive orders are reviewable by federal courts and can be superseded by federal legislation and supreme decisions to manage the growing federal bureaucracy presidents have gradually surrounded themselves with many layers of staff who were eventually organized into the executive office of the president of the united states within the executive office the innermost layer of aides and their assistants are located in the white house office president also has unreviewable authority over the matters of immigration and can ban entry to the usa of foreign nationals who have no claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the united at will 37 38 juridical powers the president also has the power to nominate federal judges including members of the united states courts of appeals and the supreme court of the united states however these nominations require senate confirmation securing senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance when nominating judges to u s district courts presidents often respect the long standing tradition of senatorial courtesy presidents may also grant pardons and reprieves bill clinton pardoned patty hearst on his last day in office as is often done just before the end of a presidential term but not without controversy 39 40 41 historically two doctrines concerning executive power have developed that enable the president to exercise executive power with a degree of autonomy the first is executive privilege which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties george washington first claimed privilege when congress requested to see chief justice john jay s notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with great britain while not enshrined in the constitution or any other law action created the precedent for the privilege when richard nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to congress during the watergate scandal the supreme court ruled in united states v nixon 418 u s 683 1974 that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution when president bill clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the lewinsky scandal the supreme court ruled in clinton v jones 520 u s 681 1997 that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits these cases established the legal precedent that executive privilege is valid although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined additionally federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president 42 president george w bush delivering the 2007 state of the union address with vice president dick cheney and speaker of the house nancy pelosi behind him the state secrets privilege allows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from discovery in legal proceedings if such release would harm national security precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when thomas jefferson refused to release military documents in the treason trial of aaron burr and again in totten v united states 92 u s 105 1876 when the supreme court dismissed a case brought by a former union spy 43 however the privilege was not formally recognized by the u s supreme court until united states v reynolds 345 u s 1 1953 where it was held to be a common law evidentiary privilege 44 before the september 11 attacks use of the privilege had been rare but increasing in frequency 45 since 2001 the government has asserted the privilege in more cases and at earlier stages of the litigation thus in some instances causing dismissal of the suits before reaching the merits of the claims as in the ninth circuit s ruling in mohamed v jeppesen dataplan inc 44 46 47 critics of the privilege claim its use has become a tool for the government to cover up illegal or embarrassing government actions 48 49 legislative facilitator the ineligibility clause prevents the president and all other executive officers from simultaneously being a member of congress therefore the president cannot directly introduce legislative proposals for consideration in congress however the president can take an indirect role in shaping legislation especially if the political party has a majority in one or both houses of congress for example the president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into congress the president can further influence the legislative branch through constitutionally mandated periodic reports to congress these reports may be either written or oral but today are given as the state of the union address which often outlines the legislative proposals for the coming year additionally the president may attempt to have congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made in the 20th century critics began charging that too many legislative and budgetary powers have slid into the hands of presidents that should belong to congress as the head of the executive branch presidents control a vast array of agencies that can issue regulations with little oversight from congress one critic charged that presidents could appoint a virtual army of czars each wholly unaccountable to congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the white house 50 presidents have been criticized for making signing statements when signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it 51 this practice has been criticized by the american bar association as unconstitutional 52 conservative commentator george will wrote of an increasingly swollen executive branch and the eclipse of congress 53 according to article ii section 3 clause 2 of the constitution the president may convene either or both houses of congress if both houses cannot agree on a date of adjournment the president may appoint a date for congress to adjourn ceremonial roles president woodrow wilson throwing out the ceremonial first ball on opening day 1916 as head of state the president can fulfill traditions established by previous presidents william howard taft started the tradition of throwing out the ceremonial first pitch in 1910 at griffith stadium washington d c on the washington senators opening day every president since taft except for jimmy carter threw out at least one ceremonial first ball or pitch for opening day the all star game or the world series usually with much fanfare 54 the president of the united states has served as the honorary president of the boy scouts of america since the founding of the organization 55 other presidential traditions are associated with american holidays rutherford b hayes began in 1878 the first white house egg rolling for local children 56 beginning in 1947 during the harry s truman administration every thanksgiving the president is presented with a live domestic turkey during the annual national thanksgiving turkey presentation held at the white house since 1989 when the custom of pardoning the turkey was formalized by george h w bush the turkey has been taken to a farm where it will live out the rest of its natural life 57 presidential traditions also involve the role as head of government many outgoing presidents since james buchanan traditionally give advice to their successor during the presidential transition 58 ronald reagan and his successors have also left a private message on the desk of the oval office on inauguration day for the incoming president 59 four ruffles and flourishes and hail to the chief long version problems playing this file see media help during a state visit by a foreign head of state the president typically hosts a state arrival ceremony held on the south lawn a custom begun by john f kennedy in 1961 60 this is followed by a state dinner given by the president which is held in the state dining room later in the evening 61 the modern presidency holds the president as one of the premier celebrities some argue that images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration public relations officials as well as by presidents themselves one critic described the presidency as propagandized leadership which has a mesmerizing power surrounding the office 62 administration public relations managers staged carefully crafted photo ops of smiling presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras 63 one critic wrote the image of john f kennedy was described as carefully framed in rich detail which drew on the power of myth regarding the incident of pt 109 64 and wrote that kennedy understood how to use images to further his presidential ambitions 65 as a result some political commentators have opined that american voters have unrealistic expectations of presidents voters expect a president to drive the economy vanquish enemies lead the free world comfort tornado victims heal the national soul and protect borrowers from hidden credit card fees 66 critics of evolution main articles imperial presidency and imperiled presidency most of the founding fathers expected the congress which was the first branch of government described in the constitution to be the dominant branch of government they did not expect a strong executive 67 however presidential power has shifted over time which has resulted in claims that the modern presidency has become too powerful 68 69 unchecked unbalanced 70 and monarchist in nature 71 critic dana d nelson believes presidents over the past thirty years have worked towards undivided presidential control of the executive branch and its agencies 72 she criticizes proponents of the unitary executive for expanding the many existing uncheckable executive powers such as executive orders decrees memorandums proclamations national security directives and legislative signing statements that already allow presidents to enact a good deal of foreign and domestic policy without aid interference or consent from congress 72 activist bill wilson opined that the expanded presidency was the greatest threat ever to individual freedom and democratic rule 73 selection process george washington the first president of the united states eligibility see also natural born citizen clause article ii section 1 clause 5 of the constitution sets the following qualifications for holding the presidency be a natural born citizen of the united states note 4 be at least thirty five years old be a resident in the united states for at least fourteen years a person who meets the above qualifications is still disqualified from holding the office of president under any of the following conditions under the twenty second amendment no person can be elected president more than twice the amendment also specifies that if any eligible person serves as president or acting president for more than two years of a term for which some other eligible person was elected president the former can only be elected president once scholars disagree over whether a person precluded by the twenty second amendment to being elected president is also precluded from being vice president 74 under article i section 3 clause 7 upon conviction in impeachment cases the senate has the option of disqualifying convicted individuals from holding federal office including that of president 75 under section 3 of the fourteenth amendment no person who swore an oath to support the constitution and later rebelled against the united states can become president however this disqualification can be lifted by a two thirds vote of each house of congress campaigns and nomination main articles united states presidential primary united states presidential nominating convention united states presidential election debates and united states presidential election the modern presidential campaign begins before the primary elections which the two major political parties use to clear the field of candidates before their national nominating conventions where the most successful candidate is made the nominee for president typically the presidential candidate chooses a vice presidential nominee and this choice is rubber stamped by the convention the most common previous profession of u s presidents is lawyer 76 nominees participate in nationally televised debates and while the debates are usually restricted to the democratic and republican nominees third party candidates may be invited such as ross perot in the 1992 debates nominees campaign across the country to explain their views convince voters and solicit contributions much of the modern electoral process is concerned with winning swing states through frequent visits and mass media advertising drives election and oath map of the united states showing the number of electoral votes allocated following the 2010 census to each state for the 2012 2016 and 2020 presidential elections it also notes that maine and nebraska distribute electors by way of the congressional district method 270 electoral votes are required for a majority out of 538 votes possible main articles electoral college united states and oath of office of the president of the united states the president is elected indirectly a number of electors collectively known as the electoral college officially select the president on election day voters in each of the states and the district of columbia cast ballots for these electors each state is allocated a number of electors equal to the size of its delegation in both houses of congress combined generally the ticket that wins the most votes in a state wins all of that electoral votes and thus has its slate of electors chosen to vote in the electoral college the winning slate of electors meet at its capital on the first monday after the second wednesday in december about six weeks after the election to vote they then send a record of that vote to congress the vote of the electors is opened by the sitting vice in that capacity as president of the senate read aloud to a joint session of the incoming congress which was elected at the same time as the president pursuant to the twentieth amendment the term of office begins at noon on january 20 of the year following the election this date known as inauguration day marks the beginning of the four year terms of both the president and the vice president before executing the powers of the office a president is constitutionally required to take the presidential oath i do solemnly swear or affirm that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states 77 although not required presidents have traditionally palmed a bible while swearing the oath and have added so help me god to the end of the oath 78 further although the oath may be administered by any person authorized by law to administer oaths presidents are traditionally sworn in by the chief justice of the united states tenure and term limits franklin d roosevelt was elected to four terms before the adoption of the twenty second amendment in 1951 the term of office for president and vice president is four years george washington the first president set an unofficial precedent of serving only two terms before franklin d roosevelt ulysses s grant and theodore roosevelt each unsuccessfully sought a third term in 1940 franklin d roosevelt was elected to a third term after being drafted by his party in 1941 the united states entered world war ii leading voters to elect roosevelt to a fourth term in 1944 roosevelt died on april 12 1945 82 days into his fourth term after the war and in response to roosevelt being elected to third and fourth terms the twenty second amendment was adopted the amendment bars anyone from being elected president more than twice or once if that person served more than half of another term harry s truman president when this amendment was adopted was exempted from its limitations and briefly sought a third a second full term before withdrawing from the 1952 election since the adoption five presidents have served two full terms dwight d eisenhower ronald reagan bill clinton george w bush and barack obama jimmy carter and george h w bush sought a second term but were defeated richard nixon was elected to a second term but resigned before completing it lyndon b johnson was the only president under the amendment to be eligible to serve more than two terms in total having served for only fourteen months following john f assassination however johnson withdrew from the 1968 democratic primary surprising many americans gerald ford sought a full term after serving out the last two years and five months of second term but was not elected succession vacancy or disability see also twenty fifth amendment to the united states constitution united states presidential line of succession presidential succession act and impeachment in the united states succession to or vacancies in the office of president may arise under several possible circumstances death resignation and removal from office article ii section 4 of the constitution allows for the removal of high federal officials including the president from office for treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors article i section 2 clause 5 gives the house of representatives the power to impeach such officials by a majority vote article i section 3 clause 6 gives the senate the power to remove impeached officials from office given a two thirds vote to convict the house has thus far impeached two presidents andrew johnson in 1868 and bill clinton in 1998 neither was subsequently convicted by the senate however johnson was acquitted by just one vote under section 3 of the twenty fifth amendment the president may transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president who then becomes acting president by transmitting a statement to the speaker of the house and the president pro tempore of the senate stating the reasons for the transfer the president resumes the discharge of the presidential powers and duties upon transmitting to those two officials a written declaration stating that resumption this transfer of power may occur for any reason the president considers appropriate in 2002 and again in 2007 president george w bush briefly transferred presidential authority to vice president dick cheney in both cases this was done to accommodate a medical procedure that required bush to be sedated both times bush returned to duty later the same day 79 under section 4 of the twenty fifth amendment the vice president in conjunction with a majority of the cabinet may transfer the presidential powers and duties from the president to the vice president by transmitting a written declaration to the speaker of the house and the president pro tempore of the senate that the president is unable to discharge the presidential powers and duties if this occurs then the vice president will assume the presidential powers and duties as acting president however the president can declare that no such inability exists and resume the discharge of the presidential powers and duties if the vice president and cabinet contest this claim it is up to congress which must meet within two days if not already in session to decide the merit of the claim the united states constitution mentions the resignation of the president but does not regulate its form or the conditions for its validity pursuant to federal law the only valid evidence of the resignation is a written instrument to that effect signed by the president and delivered to the office of the secretary of state 80 this has only occurred once when richard nixon delivered a letter to henry kissinger to that effect section 1 of the twenty fifth amendment states that the vice president becomes president upon the removal from office death or resignation of the preceding president the presidential succession act of 1947 provides that if the offices of president and vice president are each either vacant or are held by a disabled person the next officer in the presidential line of succession the speaker of the house becomes acting president the line then extends to the president pro tempore of the senate followed by every member of the cabinet a person must fulfill all eligibility requirements of the office of president to be eligible to become acting president ineligible individuals are skipped political affiliation throughout most of its history politics of the united states have been dominated by political parties political parties had not been anticipated when the u s constitution was drafted in 1787 nor did they exist at the time of the first presidential election in organized political parties developed in the u s in the but political factions from which organized parties evolved began to appear almost immediately after the federal government came into existence those who supported the washington administration were referred to as pro administration and would eventually form the federalist party while those in opposition joined the emerging democratic republican party 81 greatly concerned about the very real capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together washington remained unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eight year presidency he was and remains the only u s president never to be affiliated with a political party 82 since george washington 43 persons have been sworn into office as president and all have been affiliated with a political party at the time
