weather station wikipedia weather station from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search weather station at mildura airport victoria australia a weather station is a facility either on land or sea with instruments and equipment for measuring atmospheric conditions to provide information for weather forecasts and to study the weather and climate the measurements taken include temperature atmospheric pressure humidity wind speed wind direction and precipitation amounts wind measurements are taken with as few other obstructions as possible while temperature and humidity measurements are kept free from direct solar radiation or insolation manual observations are taken at least once daily while automated measurements are taken at least once an hour weather conditions out at sea are taken by ships and buoys which measure slightly different meteorological quantities such as sea surface temperature sst wave height and wave period drifting weather buoys outnumber their moored versions by a significant amount contents 1 instruments 1.1 exposure 2 personal weather station 3 home weather station 4 dedicated ships 5 dedicated buoys 6 synoptic weather station 7

wind speed atmospheric pressure air temperature and tides typical weather stations have the following instruments thermometer for measuring air and sea surface temperature barometer for measuring atmospheric pressure hygrometer for measuring humidity anemometer for measuring wind speed pyranometer for measuring solar radiation rain gauge for measuring liquid precipitation over a set period of time in addition at certain automated airport weather stations additional instruments may be employed including present weather precipitation identification sensor for identifying falling precipitation disdrometer for measuring drop size distribution transmissometer for measuring visibility ceilometer for measuring cloud ceiling more sophisticated stations may also measure the ultraviolet index leaf wetness soil moisture soil temperature water temperature in ponds lakes creeks or rivers and occasionally other data exposure edit except for those instruments requiring direct exposure to the elements anemometer rain gauge the instruments should be sheltered in a vented box usually a stevenson screen to keep direct sunlight off the thermometer and wind off the hygrometer the instrumentation may be specialized to allow for periodic recording otherwise significant manual labour is required for record keeping automatic transmission of data in a format such as metar is also desirable as many weather data is required for weather forecasting personal weather station edit roof mounted weather station instruments a personal weather station is a set of weather measuring instruments operated by a private individual club association or even business where obtaining and distributing weather data is not a part of the business operation personal weather stations have become more advanced and can include many different sensors to measure weather conditions these sensors can vary between models but most measure wind speed wind direction outdoor and indoor temperatures outdoor and indoor humidity barometric pressure rainfall and finally uv or solar radiation other sensors that may be available can measure soil moisture soil temperature and leaf wetness the quality number of instruments and placement of personal weather stations can vary widely making the determination of which stations collect accurate meaningful and comparable data difficult personal weather stations also typically involve a digital console that provides readouts of the data being collected these consoles may interface to a personal computer where data can be displayed stored and uploaded to websites or data ingestion distribution systems open source weather stations are available that are designed to be fully customizable by users 1 personal weather stations may be operated solely for the enjoyment and education of the owner however some owners share their results with others they do this by either by manually compiling data and distributing it distributing data over the internet or sharing data via amateur radio the citizen weather observer program cwop is a service which facilitates the sharing of information from personal weather stations this data is submitted through use of software a personal computer and internet connection or amateur radio and are utilized by groups such as the national weather service nws when generating forecast models each weather station submitting data to cwop will also have an individual web page that depicts the data submitted by that station the weather underground internet site is another popular destination for the submittal and sharing of data with others around the world as with cwop each station submitting data to weather underground has a unique web page displaying their submitted data the uk met office s weather observations website wow also allows such data to be shared and displayed 2 home weather station edit home weather stations include hygrometers thermometers barographs and barometers commonly wall mounted and made by manufacturers such as airguide taylor springfield sputnik and stormoguide the weather ship m s polarfront at sea dedicated ships edit main article weather ship a weather ship was a ship stationed in the ocean as a platform for surface and upper air meteorological measurements for use in weather forecasting it was also meant to aid in search and rescue operations and to support transatlantic flights 3 4 the establishment of weather ships proved to be so useful during world war ii that the international civil aviation organization icao established a global network of 13 weather ships in 1948 3 of the 12 left in operation in 1996 nine were located in the northern atlantic ocean while three were located in the northern pacific ocean the agreement of the weather ships ended in 1990 weather ship observations proved to be helpful in wind and wave studies as they did not avoid weather systems like merchant ships tended to and were considered a valuable resource 5 the last weather ship was ms polarfront known as weather station m jilindras at run by the norwegian meteorological institute ms polarfront was removed from service january 1 2010 since the 1960s this role has been largely superseded by satellites long range aircraft and weather buoys weather observations from ships continue from thousands of voluntary merchant vessels in routine commercial operation the old weather crowdsourcing project transcribes naval logs from before the era of dedicated ships weather buoy operated by the noaa national data buoy center dedicated buoys edit main article weather buoy weather buoys are instruments which collect weather and oceanography data within the oceans and lakes 6 7 8 moored buoys have been in use since 1951 9 while drifting buoys have been used since the late 1970s 10 moored buoys are connected with the seabed using either chains nylon or buoyant polypropylene 11 with the decline of the weather ship they have taken a more primary role in measuring conditions over the open seas since the 1970s 12 during the 1980s and 1990s a network of buoys in the central and eastern tropical pacific ocean helped study the el oscillation 13 moored weather buoys range from 1.5 metres to 12 metres in diameter 11 while drifting buoys are smaller with diameters of 30 centimetres to 40 centimetres 14 drifting buoys are the dominant form of weather buoy in sheer number with 1250 located worldwide 10 wind data from buoys has smaller error than that from ships 15 there are differences in the values of sea surface temperature measurements between the two platforms as well relating to the depth of the measurement and whether or not the water is heated by the ship which measures the quantity 16 synoptic weather station edit synoptic automatic weather station synoptic weather stations are instruments which collect meteorological information at synoptic time 00h00 06h00 12h00 18h00 utc and at intermediate synoptic hours 03h00 09h00 15h00 21h00 utc the common instruments of measure are anemometer wind vane pressure sensor thermometer hygrometer and rain gauge the weather measures are formatted in special format and transmit to wmo to help the weather forecast model networks edit a variety of land based weather station networks have been set up globally some of these are basic to analyzing weather fronts and pressure systems such as the synoptic observation network while others are more regional in nature known as mesonets global edit citizen weather observer program cwop 17 weather
