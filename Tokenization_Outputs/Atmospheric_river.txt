particularly intense storm system produced as much as of precipitation in california and up to of snowfall in the sierra nevada during december 2010 layered precipitable water imagery of a particularly strong atmospheric river stretching from the caribbean to the united kingdom on 5 december 2015 caused by storm desmond a second atmospheric river which originated from the philippines can be seen in the pacific ocean off the west coast of north america an atmospheric river ar is a narrow corridor or filament of concentrated moisture in the atmosphere atmospheric rivers consist of narrow bands of enhanced water vapor transport typically along the boundaries between large areas of divergent surface air flow including some frontal zones in association with extratropical cyclones that form over the oceans 1 2 3 4 pineapple express storms are the most commonly represented and recognized type of atmospheric rivers they are given the name due to the warm water vapor plumes originating over the hawaiian tropics that follow a path towards california 5 6 the term was originally coined by researchers reginald newell and yong zhu of the massachusetts institute of technology in the early 1990s to reflect the narrowness of the moisture plumes involved 1 3 7 atmospheric rivers are typically several thousand kilometers long and only a few hundred kilometers wide and a single one can carry a greater flux of water than the largest river the amazon river 2 there are typically of these narrow plumes present within a hemisphere at any given time in the current research field of atmospheric rivers the length and width factors described above in conjunction with an integrated water vapor depth greater than are used as standards to categorize atmospheric river events 6 8 9 10 however as data modeling techniques progress integrated water vapor transport ivt is becoming a more common data type used to interpret atmospheric rivers its strength lies in its ability to show the transportation of water vapor over multiple time steps instead of a stagnant measurement of water vapor depth in a specific air column iwv in addition ivt is more directly attributed to orographic precipitation a key factor in the production of intense rainfall and subsequent flooding 10 atmospheric rivers have a central role in the global water cycle on any given day atmospheric rivers account for over 90% of the global meridional north south water vapor transport yet they cover less than 10% of the circumference 2 they also are the major cause of extreme precipitation events that cause severe flooding in many mid latitude westerly coastal regions of the world including the west coast of north america 11 12 13 8 western europe 14 15 16 and the west coast of north africa 3 the significance atmospheric rivers have for the control of coastal water budgets juxtaposed against their creation of detrimental floods can be constructed and studied by looking at california and the surrounding coastal region of the western united states in this region atmospheric rivers have contributed 30-50% of total annual rainfall 17 in conjunction californian land falling atmospheric rivers have been historically associated with approximately all major flooding events 5 8 the inconsistency of rainfall is due to the variability in strength and quantity of these storms which can produce strenuous effects on water budget the factors described above make california a perfect case study to show the importance of proper water management and prediction of these storms 6 see also edit
