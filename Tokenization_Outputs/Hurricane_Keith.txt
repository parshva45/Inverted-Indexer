meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the scale on 2000 a tropical wave an elongated area of low air pressure moving from east to west exited the west coast of africa it moved westward across the atlantic ocean without development due to the presence of upper level wind shear after moving across the caribbean sea a disturbance along the wave started to become better organized on 2 the next day a hurricane hunters flight indicated a closed circulation and winds of upon receiving the data the national hurricane center nhc initiated advisories on tropical depression fifteen at 2100 utc 3 the nhc later estimated the depression had formed three hours earlier about north northeast of cabo gracias a dios 2 upon forming the depression had good outflow although the convection was not as organized 3 with an anticyclone over the system the depression was expected to gradually intensify while moving slowly to the west northwest a motion caused by weak steering winds 4 late on the nhc upgraded the depression to tropical storm status and named it keith 2 after another hurricane hunters mission reported flight level winds of 5 hurricane keith near landfall in belize on october 1 by the time keith became a tropical storm it was beginning to undergo rapid deepening 2 fueled by warm waters low wind shear and an organizing cloud pattern 5 there initially was uncertainty in the future movement due to a ridge in the gulf of mexico tropical cyclone prediction models differed on their assessments three models anticipated a turn to the northeast toward florida due to a trough while others predicted a continued slow motion to the west northwest eventually reaching the bay of campeche 6 after continued strengthening keith became a hurricane on just after becoming a tropical storm 2 and making it the seventh such storm of that intensity of the season 7 that day an eye began developing as the structure became much better organized 8 in a period beginning at on keith underwent explosive deepening as its barometric pressure dropped at a rate of nearly per hour 2 the nhc noted that keith experienced conditions ideal for strengthening with the exception of the approaching land interaction with the peninsula 9 the hurricane slowed until stalling offshore eastern belize caused by the ridge to the north and the precursor to tropical storm leslie forming over cuba 2 by early on keith had developed a well defined eye about in diameter with what the nhc described as a spectacular appearance 10 later that day hurricane hunters estimated a minimum pressure of and deployed a dropsonde that observed peak winds of based on the data the nhc estimated that keith attained peak winds of at on while just offshore eastern belize this made it a category 4 on the saffir simpson hurricane scale 2 shortly after keith reached peak intensity the eye had moved over portions of belize causing it to lose definition outflow became restricted and the developing disturbance to the northeast increased wind shear as a result keith began to weaken steadily on 11 while remaining nearly stationary keith made a landfall on ambergris cay late on as a minimal hurricane shortly thereafter keith weakened into a tropical storm 2 and its convection became limited to the southeastern quadrant 12 at the storm made its second landfall about north of belize city and within nine hours weakened into a tropical depression 2 the building ridge to the north caused the system to accelerate more to the west northwest across the peninsula 13 early on keith emerged into the bay of campeche 2 where favorable conditions allowed convection to quickly redevelop 14 later that day it re intensified into a tropical storm 2 with improved outflow and convective organization 15 on the hurricane hunters reported a circular eye had reformed along with winds supporting an upgrade to hurricane status 16 keith intensified further that day until it made its final landfall north of tampico with winds of 2 it rapidly weakened over the high terrain of northeastern mexico 17 dissipating late on 2 preparations edit on shortly after keith formed a hurricane watch was issued for the peninsula from chetumal to cabo catoche in quintana roo the next day as keith was nearing hurricane intensity the watch was upgraded to a warning and
